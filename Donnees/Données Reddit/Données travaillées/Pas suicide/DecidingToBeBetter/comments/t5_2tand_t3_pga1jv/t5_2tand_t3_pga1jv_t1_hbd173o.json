If you managed to escape your teens unscathed, then you are one of the lucky ones.\n\nOne of life's truths that I both love and hate is; life begins outside your comfort zone. If you are able to travel and it feels right, do it!  But don't go just because it's \"what people do in their 20's\". Finding direction and purpose is unique to every individual. What is right for some people may not be right for you.\n\nIf stagnancy is a problem, start small. Take a class, try out a new hobby or exercise routine. Try meditation or yoga, even religion. If that kinda stuff makes you want to puke, then hey, you learned something about yourself! Just taking some steps, not necessarily leaps, can help you move forward.\n\nI'm very familiar with feeling lost, or stuck. My stuff mostly has to do with health problems and recovering from addiction, but the principles are similar. You gotta do the thing you're scared to do. (as long as you aren't harming or re-traumatizing yourself in any way)\n\nOr at least, that's my experience.
