You are in a neat position in that you could use your parents place as home base while moving around on a long-term 'workaction'.  A lot of folks do this in places like SE Asia and Central/South America because their money goes a lot further.  Europe would work great as well though more expensive.  If I was younger and didn't have all the attachments it's something I would do... and I still have done it a bit since it's cheap to rent an ABNB for a month.\n\nIf you want to focus on longer term sort of an interesting challenge to pursue is start thinking about what a 'perfect life' is to you.  It shouldn't be easy and sometimes using a 'perfect day' as a starting place gets things moving.  When you feel confident you know what a perfect life for you looks like you can start working on this.  This can provide some purpose/goal and it also cuts through a lot of the modern-day noise and gets you focused on the things you value in particular.  Want a house on the beach in Hawaii?  Most people that would be a pipe dream but if you are focus you can find a way to make it work.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pga1jv/my_life_feels_directionless_and_i_dont_know_what/hbazqq5/"}
