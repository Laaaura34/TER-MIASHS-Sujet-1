I havent gotten quite over it but at this point, I just keep trying to go into situations where I test myself to just do my best and do one thing better than the last interaction. May that be hold eye contact just one second longer, keep talking when my faces blushes instead of stuttering and killing the convo as fast as possible. \n\nIt's really challenging and my self reflection reminds me I have grown a lot with the same things but it's been trial and error. Ultimately, I wish you the best of luck with building self esteem which segues into the most impressive social interactions !", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k8gaw4/how_to_comfortably_talk_to_boys/geya2va/"}
