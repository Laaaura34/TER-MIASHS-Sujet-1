It sounds sucky but I literally faked it till I made it. I pretended to be confident in small doses when I could handle it. I kept pushing myself and just \u201cacted\u201d like what I thought confident was. After about a year I would say I noticed less acting and it became more natural. Super awkward for the first month or two tho while I was working out what acting confident meant haha. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k8gaw4/how_to_comfortably_talk_to_boys/geyb7pc/"}
