Interest is absolutely essential here. **You cannot be forced to be interested in something.** Interest seizes you, dominates your waking mind, infiltrates your life...and you like\nit. When you are interested, or rather captivated, hours mean nothing, all you want to do is just dive deeper and deeper. Not that it isn\u2019t a gruesome haul at times, but the reward of having knowledge about something you are interested in is *worth the inconveniences of study*. It\u2019s a special kind of joy.\n\nBut if you\u2019re taking a class simply to check a box and get through it, you will have to accept mediocre retention of the necessary information. If you can find a way to see the intrinsic value of a subject, it will get better. But some classes are absolutely a waste of time, *but that doesn\u2019t stop you from finding a way to enjoy it.* Sometimes I would write a paper on something I really enjoyed, pouring hours into it knowing full well that the professor didn\u2019t give a shit. It didn\u2019t matter what grade I got or whether it was technically up to par, I needed to do it for me. It was to nourish the special gift of having interest in *something.* \n\nThe answer you are looking for is \u201cdiscipline\u201d. Maybe that\u2019s what you need, or maybe your brain is bored out of its wits and needs real stimulation. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9165qe/i_reached_the_advanced_level_of_procrastination/e2x5r5d/"}
