It's not an easy thing to face, but once you do and use that time you used to use on googling/reading ABOUT what you want to succeed in rather than actually doing what you need to do in order to succeed, you'll feel a lot better about your success. You'll get there! :) ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9165qe/i_reached_the_advanced_level_of_procrastination/e2w2hac/"}
