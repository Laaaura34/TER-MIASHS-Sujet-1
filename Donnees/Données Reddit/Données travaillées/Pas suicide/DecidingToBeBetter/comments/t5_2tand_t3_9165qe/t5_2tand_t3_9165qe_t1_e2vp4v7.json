It's the trick that is leveraged in marketing with \"easy, fast\" headlines. \n\nThe easy/fast part comes only after your synapses are really optimized for your task, and that takes a lot of hard basic practice. There is no shortcut.\n\nSecond: Progression is something that follows Pareto's law. You get 80% of improvement in the first 20% of time you invest into. \n\nThe to get the last 20% of improvement (where the nice juice is) it takes 80% of the time you invest. The total 100% (well, it's more like 95% really) is usually around 10.000 hours invested.\n\nSo, every time you start something new, progression is really fast and this makes you feel good. When you get to the harder path, you are inclined to drop that thing and find something else.\n\nThis is correlated to the better clothes / better phone, it's just to have that good feel that comes from dopamine and such, it's just chemistry.\n\nThe good news it's that you can hack that. Write down a tasklist, build your own small goals, and then follow them. You need to delete the item you do from the list. \n\nLiterally you need to have a list written on paper, and you delete the stuff you did writing over them with paper. You know why? \n\nIt gives you the same good feel of above, but without the money wasting of a new phone or the time wasting of a new thing to follow.\n\nTry that.\n\nAlso read \"barking up the wrong tree\", it's the book where I learned this stuff.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9165qe/i_reached_the_advanced_level_of_procrastination/e2vp4v7/"}
