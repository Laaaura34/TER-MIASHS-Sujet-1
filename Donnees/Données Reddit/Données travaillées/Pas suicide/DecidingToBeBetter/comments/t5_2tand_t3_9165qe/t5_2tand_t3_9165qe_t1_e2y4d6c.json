Now, I became a lot better in my life and I think I'm 10x myself.\n\nTo stop procrastinating, I found a weapon called ToDo List. It's a little bit dumb talking about it, but in the way that I plan, it becomes better than just a list of few things to do in the day.\nFirst, make a list, every end of the day, of everything, I said e v e r y t h i n g, you have to do in your life from now to the further school project you have to do. Then, from these things, search for just 3 to 4 that are the most important to the next day. But remember, at least 3 in a day, nothing less than this. And, in the other day, go to do these 3 things.\n\nAbout the gym, here's a tip. You have to do this, right? But, why you have to do this? To be more healthy. And why you have to be more healthy? To don't die earlier.\nThe thing is to question yourself about the why you are doing something that you want to do. This way, your mind you remember why you have to do it.\n\nIt's a little bit dumb to say this, but say to yourself to do it. And go to do it. This will generate a trigger in your brain that will make you to think about doing it and going to do it.\n\nI hope that this help you ;D", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9165qe/i_reached_the_advanced_level_of_procrastination/e2y4d6c/"}
