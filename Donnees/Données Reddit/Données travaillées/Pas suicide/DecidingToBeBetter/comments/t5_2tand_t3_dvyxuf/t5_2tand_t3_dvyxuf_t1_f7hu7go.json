I hadn't even realized how little money my immigrant parents made until I found out free lunches in high school were not the norm. It was even more shocking when I started applying to colleges/fafsa and I'm lucky they encouraged me to go to college (with the help of scholarships of course). \n\nWhat's helped me a lot was talking openly about financial circumstances with my friends and peers. I've noticed a big part of my resentment was because of how little I know about others' specific situations. Everyone has their own amount of struggle and hardship in all forms.\n\nMany of my friends in the upper-middle class are also very aware of their socioeconomic status, even to the point of feeling guilty. This guilt doesn't make me feel any better, but all we can do is be proud of each other's accomplishments no matter where we come from.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7hu7go/"}
