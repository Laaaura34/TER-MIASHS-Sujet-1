How funny, writing is actually my passion lol. I\u2019m in an unusual position. On one hand, I\u2019m wasting away in retail, feeling the most fulfilled when my managers ask me to compose sensitive emails for them. On the other hand, I work for a company that actually upholds a strong ethical stance that aligns with my own, with a work family that make me legitimately love going in every day. I even have good (albeit more and more and more expensive) health insurance and a 401k. \n\nStill I know I\u2019ll always feel like a failure if I don\u2019t go to college. I was very competitive in high school, right up until I dropped out. I earned a state diploma through some courses at the community college but never finished my associates  degree because of more family dysfunction. So obviously, it\u2019s very complicated lol. But I\u2019m thankful for your perspective! I\u2019m glad you found success \ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7kx16i/"}
