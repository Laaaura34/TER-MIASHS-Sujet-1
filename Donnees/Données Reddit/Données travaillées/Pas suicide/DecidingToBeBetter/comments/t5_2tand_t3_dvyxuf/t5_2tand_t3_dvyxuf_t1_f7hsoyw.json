We naturally covet what we don't have, and see it as \"you don't know how good you have it/how lucky you are.\" Someone has likely felt this way about you, or easily could, given many circumstances. You're not a spoiled piece of shit. You're not going to be handed life on a silver platter bc of your parents achievements. You have the opportunity to define your life and success as you see fit. You have all the makings of THE BEST KIND OF PERSON. Jealousy is a poison. Don't let it infect your life too much, a healthy competitive edge is a great source of inspiration, but stay humble and keep it in the realm of reality.
