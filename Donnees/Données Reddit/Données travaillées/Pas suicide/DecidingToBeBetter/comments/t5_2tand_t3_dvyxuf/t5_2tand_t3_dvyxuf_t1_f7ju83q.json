I was a prof for a few years but left to make money. My loans came from my MA program; you can teach while you earn your PhD and not pay tuition (you really shouldn't do that - it is so not worth it, esp for the humanities). Yes, I am still paying off my loan and I detest it. But what else could I do? I didn't want to work in retail all my life and I'm not good with my hands. I wanted to teach college - so I went for what I loved. Then I left to write for a company b/c I like money too :) Sometimes you just have to take a chance on yourself. A student loan sucks but it's not like a new car payment...you always have that degree and those connections.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7ju83q/"}
