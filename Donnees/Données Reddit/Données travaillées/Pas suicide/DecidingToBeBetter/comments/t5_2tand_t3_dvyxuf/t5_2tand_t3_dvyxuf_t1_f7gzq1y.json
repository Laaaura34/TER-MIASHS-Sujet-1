Until till you realise that the world literally owes you nothing...you just end up moving forward regardless. Someone could be born poor with terrible upbringing and another could be born super rich with parents who gave them the best advice to live the rest of their life.\n\n...and what. What can I do about that. Eventually I want to be in the same position where I can offer that to my future child. There's a nurse out there working 50hr weeks for minimum wage and there's a youtuber earning her yearly salary in a week. It's not that the world is evil, or people are evil. It's just seizing those opportunities that are available to you whether you were born rich or poor.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7gzq1y/"}
