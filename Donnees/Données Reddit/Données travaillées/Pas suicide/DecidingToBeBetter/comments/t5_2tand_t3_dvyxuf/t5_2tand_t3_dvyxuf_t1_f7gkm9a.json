I was brought up in a lower middle class family. My father was a shopkeeper who will rise early and come home late at night. He never have holidays. Only when we go to our native house for 2-3 days a year he will take leave. I never had a proper happy childhood. When my friends used to talk about picnic and weekend classes, I had no such stories to tell. We never did go out as a family. Never went to movies, parks or any functions. My parents quarrelled a lot. School was my favourite place because that is an escape from home temporarily. I never had any gifts for birthdays. I never got the things I wanted (I got all the stuffs I need for school for which I am grateful). Growing up I used to dream of uplifting our lives. I never wanted to become rich or start a business. I was only hoping for a normal decent office job. The thing is, my father passed away a month after I finish my college. I was stuck here living as a shopkeeper since 6 years ago. Occasionally, I try to go for some interviews. But most times, the inferiority complex I developed from my childhood kicks in and makes me suffer. Sometimes it makes me lazy and procrastinate. When I go out and see people my age, I compare them with my childhood. I see the way they dress, the way they talk, the privileges they've had and I feel so inferior and weak. I am sorry about the long comment. It's just these past two days I am having the worst feelings.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7gkm9a/"}
