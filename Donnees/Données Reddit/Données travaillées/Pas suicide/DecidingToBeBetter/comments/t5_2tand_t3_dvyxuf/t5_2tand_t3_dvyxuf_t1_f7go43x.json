Sure, being privileged usually means being wealthy etc and it\u2019s nice not to have to worry about money.  \n\nBut where the more privileged might be enjoying their wealth, you were learning important, useful life lessons and maturing in a way that many people never do throughout their entire lives. \n\nThe skill of keeping your emotions in check, steeling yourself to do what you know you have to do regardless of the situation and how you\u2019re feeling at the time. The fact that you learned this at an early age means you\u2019re a full step ahead of many other people. \n\nBasically, you didn\u2019t have material wealth, but you did gain knowledge and empathy which might be worth more than any amount of money can ever buy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7go43x/"}
