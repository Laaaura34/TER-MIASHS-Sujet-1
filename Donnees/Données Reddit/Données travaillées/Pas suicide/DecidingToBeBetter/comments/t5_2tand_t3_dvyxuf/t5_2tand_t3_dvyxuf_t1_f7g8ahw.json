What you are seeing is a glimpse into someone's life. It is not the whole picture of what is happening. Generally it's not even close. If you want to compare yourself to someone and it to help you. Then compare yourself to your past self. Compare yourself to what you did yesterday and try and improve on it. Compare yourself to how you started out the year and see where you are now. Are you in a better position? Worse Position. Work on yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7g8ahw/"}
