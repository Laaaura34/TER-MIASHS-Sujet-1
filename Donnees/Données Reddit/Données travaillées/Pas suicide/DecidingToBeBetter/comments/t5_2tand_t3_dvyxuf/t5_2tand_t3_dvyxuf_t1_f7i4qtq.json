While we live quite comfortably financially growing up, both my parents are also not emotional supportive. They perceive emotions as a form of weakness so there is hardly a safe space at home for us to open up our feelings except when we're outside with friends or just between us siblings. Dad works a lot & is great at making money but he makes us feel alone. He hardly spend time with us, never asks us how our day went.(not that he is interested), comes home from work everyday to talk about what's happened at work & what he'd done during the day then goes to bed. A lot of times we'd want to talk to them about our day & whatever was happening in our lives at the time as growing teen but we get criticised for feeling what we felt so that's that. But I'd say it did help us to be more emotionally independent in a way. \n\nYeah life's not always that great being us either.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7i4qtq/"}
