Depending on generally happy/unhappy they were, or how wealthy/poor they were, determines how they'll feel later.  I think you're already on the right track.\n\nNot everyone will learn perspective like you did.  Perhaps the best you can do is be thankful for what you have now, and for how you grew up.
