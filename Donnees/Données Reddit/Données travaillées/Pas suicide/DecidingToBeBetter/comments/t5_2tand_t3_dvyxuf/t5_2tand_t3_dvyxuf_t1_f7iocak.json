All my needs were met until I turned 16 then I was left to figure life out on my own with minimal support of any kind. The emotional abuse continues even now in my early 30s.\n\nThere is some value in that. I have high expectations of myself because of my upbringing but more importantly, I learned about empathy, ethics and psychology from trying to cope with my families treatment of me. Now I am working on a degree in psychology and will likely be able to help people with a level of understanding that would mot come easy with just a higher education.\n\nI feel like everyone struggles in one way or another. Even those who seem to have it easy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7iocak/"}
