I used to feel proud of my underprivileged upbringing. I would see people who grew up with any sort of normal financial experience, or those who grew up with wealth, and feel that I was better than them for having faced that adversity. Like it made me stronger and more savvy about the world.    \n\n\n\nThe truth is that we are all the same deep down. A spoiled kid has just as much of a chance at being a kind, genuine person as someone who grew up dirt poor. The privileged kid has just as much potential to be unhappy and resentful of the world as the kid who had thrifted clothes. It's all about finding the possibility of what's *right now* and moving on from there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7fy5tr/"}
