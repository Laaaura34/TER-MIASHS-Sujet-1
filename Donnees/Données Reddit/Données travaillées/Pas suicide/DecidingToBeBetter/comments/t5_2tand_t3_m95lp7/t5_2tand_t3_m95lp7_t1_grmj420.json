I'd notice them, sure, but had a difficult time reframing them.\n\nI've been reading a book about Non-Violent Communication(NVC) with my wife and the author had a super helpful way of doing it that's been working well for me.\n\nThe whole basis of NVC is looking for the need of the person you are communicating with. So in this case, myself. When I notice a negative thought, especially something like \"why am I doing this (harmful behaviour), I'm such an idiot\", I think of the need that that behaviour is meeting currently.\n\nThat way, I'm not judging myself negatively, I'm seeing the need it's meeting. Then I can consider other more healthy alternatives to meeting that need.\n\nI struggled with this for so long, I hope this way of looking at things can help someone who reads this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m95lp7/finally_decided_to_stop_my_cycle_of_negative/grmj420/"}
