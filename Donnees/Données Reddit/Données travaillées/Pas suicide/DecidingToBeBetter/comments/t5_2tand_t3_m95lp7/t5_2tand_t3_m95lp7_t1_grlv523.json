One of the hardest things to do was to stop the negative thinking. It's like a cycle you get stuck in and once you start the negative motor it just keeps turning. Find one thing in the morning when you wake up that makes you happy. Whether it be something that's happening now or a memory and start trying to see the good in things. Don't worry about other peoples negative view on the world. You have to be you and try to create a good energy in yourself. I'm serious about the core concepts of mindfulness. It helped me so much in my negative thinking.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m95lp7/finally_decided_to_stop_my_cycle_of_negative/grlv523/"}
