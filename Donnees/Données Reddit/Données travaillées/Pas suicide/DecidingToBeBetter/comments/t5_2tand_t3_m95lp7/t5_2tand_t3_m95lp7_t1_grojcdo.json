Oddly enough, through our minds are our emotions eventually produced, so by first focusing on taking charge of your thoughts and bringing them towards a more positive and uplifting form, in doing so you set the way towards you beginning to feel differently within your heart and soul as over time those positive thoughts are likely going to become positive emotions and your state of mental health and your level of emotional and mental well being will gradually improve for the better...\n\nI hope this could encourage you to continue along the path you began to travel with your decision, I'm proud of you and hoping for the best in your life and with your situation. \n\nGood luck and God bless", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m95lp7/finally_decided_to_stop_my_cycle_of_negative/grojcdo/"}
