That little change in the cycle of negativity is the start to a whole new life and way of thinking. I used to be plagued with negativity as well. Finally I told myself when truly freaking out one day if this right here isn't true something has to change. It's all about breaking that cycle, finding a balance, and trying to be okay with just being okay. Being okay with yourself and your life. Google the core concepts of mindfulness. I don't know that it will help but it changed my life. Meditating and practicing mindfulness everyday has cleared a lot of the negativity from my thoughts and taught me to be open to change and without judgement. You can't tell where today might lead, but if your thinking negative, no matter where it goes it's gonna feel negative. Good for you, break that cycle.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m95lp7/finally_decided_to_stop_my_cycle_of_negative/grl9ua4/"}
