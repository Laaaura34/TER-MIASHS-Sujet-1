You just care more about your personal ones. For me personally I wish I could do more to help the world but I can\u2019t, cause my family isn\u2019t rich and we are all just trying to make it through the pandemic. I\u2019m going through growing pains and just try to survive each day  with classes. I try to work on myself so that soon I can help others. It seems like you need take time to heal and come back stronger. \nSorry if this wasn\u2019t articulate enough or said stuff you already know. I hope got what I was trying to say. I wish you the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k8tx9k/how_do_i_care_less_about_vaccines_social_justice/gf0ehgu/"}
