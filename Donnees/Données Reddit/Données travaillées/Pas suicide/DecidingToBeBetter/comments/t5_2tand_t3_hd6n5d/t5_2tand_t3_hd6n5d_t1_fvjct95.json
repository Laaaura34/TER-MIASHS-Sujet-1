I\u2019ve been sober almost 2 years and one of my favorite things about it is that I realize what (and who) I actually like and don\u2019t like. \n\nFor example:\nI LOVE country dancing (I live in Texas). So I will still go out with good friends and dance til 2am. They drink but I have no problem staying sober/social. \nBut I don\u2019t really enjoy house parties so much - especially after midnight. I\u2019ve been to a few that good friends have thrown, but I usually leave once it starts getting sloppy. There\u2019s not much self-work you can do to make you enjoy that in my personal opinion.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hd6n5d/be_more_social_naturally_without_alcohol/fvjct95/"}
