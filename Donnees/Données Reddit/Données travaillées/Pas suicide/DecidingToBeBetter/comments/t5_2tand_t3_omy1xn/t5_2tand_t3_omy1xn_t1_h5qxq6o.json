What you are today is the decision you made yesterday and weeks/months ago.  I only drink wine on and off and I do not smoke. Got myself engrossed in pokemons because I get to walk and exercise at the same time. I pick up cycling now. My diet is not perfect. I do eat fried chicken.

Listening and dancing to BTS helps too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/omy1xn/ive_decided_to_treat_my_body_as_the_fucking/h5qxq6o/"}
