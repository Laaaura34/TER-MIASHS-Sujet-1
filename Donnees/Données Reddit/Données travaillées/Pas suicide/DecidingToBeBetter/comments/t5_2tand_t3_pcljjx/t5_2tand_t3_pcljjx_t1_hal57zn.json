I too worked at amazon.  It was awful.  \n\nAnyway, I walked on a track that said \u201c1 lap is about 1/3 of a mile\u201d so 3 laps could be anywhere from .8 of a mile to 1.2 miles.   It really accurate.  I\u2019m gonna try to find out somehow exactly how long it is. \n\nAnyhow, it took me an average of 7 minutes per lap, so 21 minutes a mile.  The last lap I speed walked at a pretty fast pace and got a time of 5 and a half minutes.     So took almost 2 hours.  \n\nAgain though, I\u2019m thinking the track is actually slightly more than 1/3 of a mile so idk.
