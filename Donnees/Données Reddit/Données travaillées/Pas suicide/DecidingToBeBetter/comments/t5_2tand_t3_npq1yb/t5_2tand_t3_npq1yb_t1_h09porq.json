YES. You deserve - no, NEED - to forgive yourself. All hating yourself does is enable you to keep choosing wrong because you feel you\u2019re unworthy of love and therefore self-sabatoge by repeating those same mistakes. You can change, but you have to want to and try. No matter how many times you fail, you have to keep trying, because the people in your future deserve you to be a better person, YOU deserve to be a better person.
