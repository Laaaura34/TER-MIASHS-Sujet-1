I got a root canal around two years ago, and my dental health was in that state due to me being depressed and just not having the will to take care of myself.\n\nI love this sub as well, and all the others similar to it. I feel like I\u2019m cheating a little sometimes, with how monumental and life changing the advice and stories here can be. I\u2019m at a place where I never thought I\u2019d be because of the people on this app. \n\nI think that one of the best feelings I have ever experienced is getting better over the years, and one day just looking back at my past self and realizing how much has changed. All the things that I thought would continue to torment me forever have (to my surprise) faded and have changed me for the better. I believe that struggle and pain are powerful teachers, and if there\u2019s one thing that you can hold on to in a dark time it\u2019s that you\u2019ll definitely come out stronger.\n\nYou\u2019ve made the decision to start over, that\u2019s great. It\u2019s a big decision, but it\u2019s life changing. A blank slate, rebuilding your self worth, getting to know yourself, and using that knowledge to improve for the better. I feel excited for you, because I know that I was (and still am) completely ecstatic that I decided to rebuild myself from the ground up. \n\nI hope everything works out well for you. These transitions are necessary for personal growth, even if they feel a bit daunting and weird.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbuobl/its_a_wierd_transition_for_me/hhc5xrv/"}
