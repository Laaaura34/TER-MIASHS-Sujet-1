Many things require a middle ground and that middle ground tends to fluctuate with the ebb and flow of life as we experience it. I practice meditation but I also love daydreaming about my future. It doesn't necessarily take away from my present moment - dreaming of my baby on the way makes me happy. I also dream of things I want to do in my future - they become my goals. I also replay my day and sort through things - in which I apply mindfulness to events I had strong emotional reactions to in the moment. So, I think it's a balance of going with my wandering mind and quieting my mind. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3s16q7/why_we_should_stop_worrying_about_our_wandering/cwtq8jf/"}
