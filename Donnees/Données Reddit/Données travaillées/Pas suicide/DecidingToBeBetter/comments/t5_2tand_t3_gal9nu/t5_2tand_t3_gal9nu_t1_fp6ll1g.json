I guess I just get overly prickly having gone through the probably needlessly punitive process, but you could take a med school matriculant, cut their gpa and test scores in half and they would have no problem getting into chiropractor school. It\u2019s just not comparable. Chiropractors are basically the most knowledgeable form of massage therapist, which is a needed role, it\u2019s just disrespectful IMO to compare them to Doctors. Doctors are out there dying in droves to save people from Coronavirus, so are nurses, chiropractors aren\u2019t qualified to participate in a real medical setting like that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gal9nu/what_do_you_want_for_yourself/fp6ll1g/"}
