Ive never really had a career face for my dreams beyond a job that thats pays enough that i am satisfied in. My dream is to have a garden heaven that is so beautiful and serene that i feel like a princess in my own home. 300 seedlings on the go currently, and today i spent 6 hours in the yard pulling out parasitic trees and things. Its going to happen one of these years :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gal9nu/what_do_you_want_for_yourself/fp0uwwh/"}
