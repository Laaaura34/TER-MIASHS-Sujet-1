But, I wanted to make it clear.  \n\nYou don't need to rush success or anything you want to achieve. But, what I would like to add to this, is that these people didn't stop even if there was a setback to their careers. They had a lot of background hard work which we can't even comprehend. They worked their asses off until they made it big.\n\nSo, just cause they got their success late does not equal anyone slacking off and waiting to get the right opportunity. Consistent effort in bettering yourself is what gets you to the place you want to be. What I believe is, get your start faster and become better than the people listed here. Work for the success that fits your best cause. In the end, it is you who can quantify your success.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gal9nu/what_do_you_want_for_yourself/fp16583/"}
