Before I say this I am absolutely not judging a massage therapist at all. I know it is a tough test and career.\n\nChiropractor have to go to school and get a doctorate in Chiropractor and that's usually 4yrs they also require at least 3 years undergraduate degree from a college. At least they usesd to I don't know about current but their training is very intense and they learn all about the human body. You can't crack spines and not know what you're doing. Massage therapy school is typically less then a year. To compare their training to a massage therapist isn't exactly accurate. \n\nAgain. I am in no means, for anyone reading this demeaning massage therapists. I think it's a great career.\n\nI'm sorry you hold such a grudge against chiropractors", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gal9nu/what_do_you_want_for_yourself/fp6ot88/"}
