I\u2019m 25 and returning to uni after pausing for 2 years after my 1st year, and I feel so out of my depth I\u2019m not as sharp as I used to be because I just haven\u2019t used my brain and focussed like that in so long.  But we should be so thankful we can go to uni and just do your best, ask for help when needed, and you can\u2019t go wrong. My home life was shit as well, and been struggling on my own since I was 16 with quite bad mental health and no sense of identity or self confidence. But all I can say, as I\u2019m sure you can relate, is with time we have learnt and grown even if it\u2019s not in ways we wanted to. We have learnt and grown, and will continue to do so, feel like I had my mid life crisis over the past 10 years so I\u2019m hoping now this bit of direction will be the beginning for me. And you\u2019re going into it mature compared to being fresh from school as an 18 year old, which I think is far more valuable!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gal9nu/what_do_you_want_for_yourself/fp3iei3/"}
