My ex was everything that I had prayed for in a man. Only later to find out that wasn't truly his authentic self. He had been masking his symptoms of Aspergers. Which wasn't sustainable, his symptoms started showing (meltdowns and shutdowns). Then he told me about his adult Aspergers diagnosis. Lack in ability to give emotional reciprocity is one of the major symptoms of Aspergers. Even after the unmasking I tried everything I could think of to make the relationship work because my heart was all-in at this point. I did a ton of research to learn and understand Aspergers so I can understand what life for him must be like, and how to best support  him. Unfortunately in the end, it wasn't enough. He completely shut down and shut me out of his life. I was left broken-hearted and feeling like an idiot for believing that by me fully accepting him just as he is, he wouldn't abandon me. He thinks that he's doing the noble thing by saying that \"I deserve someone better.\" \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\udc94", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6n51e/how_to_stop_being_perpetually_heartbroken/h2xzutb/"}
