I\u2019ve learned the hard way what my boundaries are. And I\u2019m trying to be a better me. I feel like I\u2019m really trying, by focusing on what to do with my career and passions. I\u2019m also in therapy. I feel like I have a better idea of what I want, after all the failures. I won\u2019t let myself be mislead again. I\u2019ve always been so foolish and naive, falling for false promises and smooth words. So I\u2019ve taken this time to focus on myself. But I\u2019m still not happy. I still feel heartbroken over the last one, even though I know he\u2019s not right for me. I don\u2019t know how to forgive him. I carry resentment from all the times guys left me for someone else.\n\nAre you happy now?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6n51e/how_to_stop_being_perpetually_heartbroken/h2u7lah/"}
