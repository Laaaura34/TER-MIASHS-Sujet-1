I can relate to a lot of what you said. I\u2019ve also been insecure and desperate to be loved. I realize that if I was more confident in myself, I wouldn\u2019t have fallen for just any guy who flatters me.. which is what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve fallen for anyone who said nice things to me and made me feel special. I let my emotions consume me. I\u2019m glad you were able to set boundaries and speak your mind with the last one. I\u2019ve been learning to do that.. and it\u2019s hard. With the last guy I liked, I\u2019d always end up giving into his sweet words. He minimized my feelings, and so did I. He made me feel so high and happy and special, only to make me feel insignificant. And he made me believe I was. So I realize true love comes from within. I\u2019m trying to get there, and it\u2019s hard. Being aware of the problem is easy, but fixing it is hard. I know I need to learn to love myself. I\u2019ve learned what I really want, and yeah sometimes I\u2019ve also felt like I was asking for too much. I never really acknowledged my needs and always brushed them aside to meet someone else\u2019s. I\u2019m in therapy, to process all of the trauma in my life.. I had a shitty childhood and have both daddy and mommy issues. Self improvement has been my focus ever since the last one got a girlfriend a year ago. I don\u2019t want to ever find myself in that situation again. I recognize it won\u2019t happen overnight. The journey is hard and painful at times. My goal is to feel confident enough to not be swayed by smooth words, and to not feel so bad about myself when others don\u2019t treat me the way that I want them to. I have passions. And they\u2019ll always be with me no matter who\u2019s in my life. I have a vision for the future. And I want to learn how to achieve it alone, and be perfectly happy alone. It\u2019s hard.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6n51e/how_to_stop_being_perpetually_heartbroken/h2znb3r/"}
