It's not that this is a \"new oppressive world\", that's what you've decided to pin your fear and anxiety on because your having trouble figuring things out.   Get some professional help from someone who can help you learn how to deal with the stress. And if you're unable to deal with that stress like an adult, i.e. without screaming and banging etc, don't expect your parents to treat you like one. Maybe they will go with you to therapy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o36ii2/24m_i_need_serious_help/h2ayf70/"}
