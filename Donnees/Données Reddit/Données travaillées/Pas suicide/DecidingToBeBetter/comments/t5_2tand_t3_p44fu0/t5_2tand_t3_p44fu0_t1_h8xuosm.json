I personally am not a professional. I am thinking, perhaps it could reflect your emotions and your subconscious fears/sadness/pain?  Is there anything going on in your life that is going south? Anyone trying to control you? This reaction is perfectly normal...In my experience, it's much easier to let these feelings come and go in a safe environment.  Have a little look around for emotional processing and if you are having a hard time at first, you can easily help yourself by doing EFT. ( free manual online) You can also practice radical acceptance or the Sedona method. ( also free online with a bit of research) Alternatively, you can try a more zen approach with mindfulness...\n\nWhatever you choose, you need to try and be present, honest with your self and willing to see what is underneath it all. If you like, I can dm you a script to say to yourself when you are feeling out of control with your emotions... I wish you nothing but good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p44fu0/i_am_having_very_violent_angry_random_thoughts/h8xuosm/"}
