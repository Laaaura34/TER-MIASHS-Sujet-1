Glad you posted and that you're working to overcome this. \n\nA few questions: are you worried that you might act on these thoughts? Also, do you have the means to act on these thoughts? In other words, if you're thinking about shooting someone who pisses you off, do you have a gun?\n\nMy best advice is this: schedule a meeting with your general practitioner, doctor, or primary care provider ASAP. Like, today, if possible. If they're booked, consider going to a walk in clinic. Explain that you're having violent intrusive thoughts, you have a therapy appointment scheduled, but need help controlling them until then. They should be able to help find a medication that easily allows you to function, but releases the grip of the thoughts.\n\nUntil then, when you notice these thoughts arising, work to ground yourself in the moment. Try using the 5-4-3-2-1 technique.\n\nNotice 5 things you can see\nThen 4 things you can touch\nThen 3 things you can hear\nThen 2 things you can smell \nAnd 1 thing you can taste\n\nSpend a minute or two on this exercise to see if it helps you. If it does, use it liberally. You may also try deep belly breathing. Breathe in deeply through your nose. Hold the breath in your stomach for a few moments. Then slowly release it through your mouth like you're blowing on hot soup. The exhale should be longer than the inhale. This will help calm your nervous system.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p44fu0/i_am_having_very_violent_angry_random_thoughts/h8x7dh8/"}
