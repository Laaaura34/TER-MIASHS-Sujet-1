Normies have obtrusive thoughts but their internal response is \u201cEww, that was a weird/gross/violent thought. Anyway, I wonder what I\u2019ll have for lunch\u201d\n\nSo not to say you have OCD, but those thoughts don\u2019t define you, but they can fuck you up if you latch on to and obsess over them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p44fu0/i_am_having_very_violent_angry_random_thoughts/h8zexg4/"}
