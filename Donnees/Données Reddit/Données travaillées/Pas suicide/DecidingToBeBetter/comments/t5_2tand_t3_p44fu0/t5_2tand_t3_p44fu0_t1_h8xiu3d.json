You need to let them go when it's their time. Like waves. You can't stop the waves or thought from coming, but you can decide how to react on them. It's okay to have bad thoughts. Everyone has them, even violent once. Try to let them go. (therapy will help here) \n\n4) do some sport like punching a bag; or some activity like driving into the woods and screaming or whatever floats your boat - to give some venue of release for the emotions that build up. Drumming and punching bags is what helps me.\n\n5) sleep and food quality can effect your mood extremely. Since I have a sleep schedule and have cut down on unhealthy foods I find myself in little emotional distress. Unhealthy foods and poor sleep make your body stress out, making your mind Stress out and spin in circles.\n\n\nHope this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p44fu0/i_am_having_very_violent_angry_random_thoughts/h8xiu3d/"}
