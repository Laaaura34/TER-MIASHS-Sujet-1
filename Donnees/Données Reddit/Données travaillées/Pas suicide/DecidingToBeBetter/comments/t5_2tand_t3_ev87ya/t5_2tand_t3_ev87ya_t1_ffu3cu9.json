If you want a manual on the topic, I recommend The Mind Illuminated (see also its subreddit, /r/TheMindIlluminated ). Using meditation in little bits in daily life (in addition to a regular practice) goes a long way in giving you tools to stabilize yourself.\n\nAlso, look into the stuff that helps people with BPD, which is basically just \"too much emotions and don't know what to do with them disorder\". The main treatment is DBT, which I highly recommend; it's just a big pile of coping skills that you train. It also has mindfulness at the core of it. \n\nGoing to a partial hospitalization program (basically 4 hours of class every day for 3 weeks, and you go home in the evening) for DBT was one of the major turning points in my life becoming more stable / functional. You can also do DBT classes, but they're much more spread out (so you go once a week for a year, instead of every day for 3 weeks).\n\nFrustratingly, the online resources for DBT aren't very good, but I recommend it in its other forms.\n\n(I'm also open to DMing about this; I used to be a horrible chaos engine and have improved a lot, since then)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ev87ya/i_want_to_be_more_emotionally_balanced/ffu3cu9/"}
