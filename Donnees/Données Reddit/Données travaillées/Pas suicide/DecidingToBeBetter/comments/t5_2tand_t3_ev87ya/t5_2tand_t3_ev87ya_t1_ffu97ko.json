I'm getting a lot from the answers as this is something I'm actively working on myself. \n\nFor me, exercise helps a lot. I recently took up running and find it extremely helpful in balancing my mood. Things don't affect me quite as much and the effects last for hours after I've done it. Gotta love those endorphins! I'm not in very good shape so it's more of a run/walk combo for now, but still effective :)\n\nI second the previous suggestion of DBT training as well. I only got through the first module but found it incredibly helpful and enlightening. I want to get back to it when I can afford it again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ev87ya/i_want_to_be_more_emotionally_balanced/ffu97ko/"}
