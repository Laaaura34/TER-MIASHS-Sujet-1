What I meant is that you should also take the time to acknowledge that you were hurt and frustrated and all the bad feelings you felt. You should try to not act out, but it's normal and ok to have negative feelings after a hurtful moment. Even if other people have it worse, you still have the right to acknowledge *your* feelings and give yourself some time. Best of luck to you, I hope you found a better job or that you'll find one soon!
