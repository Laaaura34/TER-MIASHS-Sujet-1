The first step to change is recognizing that you are the problem. Take a break and go somewhere secluded where it's just you and your mind. Bring a journal with you and list out all of your mistakes and the things you need to let go of. Knowing where you went wrong can help you how to turn things around and make things right. It is also never too late to mend broken relationships.
