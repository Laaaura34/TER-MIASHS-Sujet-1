I just let the people time to breathe and recover, they deserved this time. I then apologised for my actions but still wanted to give them time. I\u2019m only now starting to talk to everyone again normally now. It takes time for them to heal while you also may need time to think and reflect on the situation. \n\nKeep you\u2019re head up though! The fact you were able to admit how you\u2019ve acted shows there is good in you, keep yourself active in this time and try not to get yourself down. Good luck, I hope all works out well!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga7lu2j/"}
