I learned because I had a bad habit of doing things and lying or hiding or making excuses... the guilt ways more on you than anything and you'll find that it's easier and better if you tell the truth. You just need to get used to saying 'it was me'.\n\nYou can do it!! Wish I could see the progress you'll make, but now I'm hoping you'll make another post in a year's time :)\n\nOne tip, don't be disappointed if you fail, because you are going to. Take it gracefully and learn from there, push harder the more you fail and you'll get there.\n\nBest of luck to you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga5eve0/"}
