SLAA if relationships themselves are your challenge, SAA if sex part of relationships is what ails you.  if you need another 12-step, i highly recommend it.  they're solid resrouces, good people, and a good path forward. \n\n* if you need support - i.e. men sharing with other men how to work through being men, then Mankind Project has been excellent for me.  if you're a gal, our sister group is Woman Within.  well worth it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga6k09f/"}
