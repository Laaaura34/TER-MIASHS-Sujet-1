You\u2019re already so far ahead by this one simple realization and genuine desire to change. It\u2019ll be hard and there will be ups and downs, but ultimately, the journey will come to you from this point forward. Just keep questioning yourself. If someone points out you have wronged them, ask how you did that, apologize, and work on never doing it again. All you can do is change your behavior in the future and offer apologies to those you feel you\u2019ve wronged. Over time you will find you\u2019ll have less and less to change and apologize for because you\u2019ll naturally learn to improve your behavior. \nI\u2019ve been an extremely toxic person in the past (still sometimes in the present- unfortunately deciding to be better isn\u2019t always a linear growth) and I\u2019d say it took me 2-3 good years of looking at myself and my behaviors to feel like I\u2019ve overcome most of it or at least can identify it and apologize for it later.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga5as8b/"}
