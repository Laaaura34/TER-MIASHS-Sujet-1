Where at first you put the full responsibility of the situation on *them*, then realized your mistake, and subsequently shifted it fully onto yourself. \n\nI'm not disagreeing with your post, I think it's incredibly mature and honest to recognize when amends need to be made on one's part. However, consider the possibility that it wasn't *all* you. It could be a majority of the blame is warranted towards yourself, but more often than not, both sides could've done differently, whether it could've been expressing oneself when something was bothering them, or not actively hurting the other etc.\n\nBe kind to yourself, even if you feel like it *is* all on you. Understand that this is a time to grow. It seems like you already view it like that. Good luck on your journey - I'm proud of you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga6ok8y/"}
