I had a bad habit of feeling like people should be able to read my thoughts and needs, this kind of fed into a delusion that somehow people were doing things to upset me on purpose, or that they didn\u2019t care if I was upset. I had to get way better at communicating to figure out that just genuinely wasn\u2019t true, and that I was just not sticking up for myself at all and not communicating what I wanted.\n\nThat also requires you to think about what you need and want to though, which a lot of people don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019d also reccomend self authoring for that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga6hg3d/"}
