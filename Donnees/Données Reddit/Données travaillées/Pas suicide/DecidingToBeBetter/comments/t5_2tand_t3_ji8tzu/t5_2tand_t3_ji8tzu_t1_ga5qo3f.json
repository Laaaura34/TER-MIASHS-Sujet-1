It becomes *a lot* easier to see what needs to change and be open to that change when you aren\u2019t holding attachments to various ideas or are telling yourself a particular narrative.  Or when you can recognize yourself acting out some of your toxic tendencies and can stop yourself before you hurt someone.  I suggest starting with 10 mins a day on one of the popular mediation apps.\n\nYou may find yourself becoming less ruminative, less defensive, and have various feelings of \u201cawakedness\u201d within a month of a consistent meditative practice but please don\u2019t stop there!  It\u2019s a lifelong learning process and each peak you reach is really just a plateau, there\u2019s so much more ahead!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga5qo3f/"}
