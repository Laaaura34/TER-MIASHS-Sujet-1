The height of your anger is the depth of the problem. Sometimes it is being triggered from things from your past. Sometimes it\u2019s because the world sucks and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Either way, it\u2019s hard feeling angry when you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m currently undergoing IEMT (Integral Eye Movement Therapy) which is very effective at getting to the root of unwanted emotions and leaving them behind. It sounds like a different kind of therapist to what you\u2019ve had before would be worth a try - one who will help you solve the cause of your anger, rather than just dealing with the symptoms. \n\nBut also, learning to walk away so that you can express your anger in a safe environment is a good short term fix. There is nothing wrong with being angry, anger is a very valid emotion; it\u2019s how it makes you behave that can be the problem.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k08981/im_scared_im_going_to_lash_out_and_end_my_next/gdh1knt/"}
