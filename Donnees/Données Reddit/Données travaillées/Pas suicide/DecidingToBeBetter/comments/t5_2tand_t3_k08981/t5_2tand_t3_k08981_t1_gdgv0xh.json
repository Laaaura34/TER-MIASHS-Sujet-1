Like loud fun music, yoga, running, aggressively cleaning. Something that lets me get all those good endorphins going. 8 years ago I was screaming and throwing books down a stairwell at someone. The angriest I get now is the shakes and a fist on the table. Not perfect but I work on it every single day. \n\nI try to ask more questions too, so I don't automatically jump to conclusions.\n\nThe first step for me was recognizing that I was about to explode, taking a deep breath and then walking away. Important to note, people fucking hate this. I've made so many people mad by me walking away but it's key to me not exploding and I try to relay that to people who need to know and are close to me. So saying something like I need a moment, or something helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k08981/im_scared_im_going_to_lash_out_and_end_my_next/gdgv0xh/"}
