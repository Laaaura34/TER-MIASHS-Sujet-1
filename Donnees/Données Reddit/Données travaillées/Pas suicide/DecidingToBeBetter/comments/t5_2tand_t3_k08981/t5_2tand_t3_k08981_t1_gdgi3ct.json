It\u2019s going to sounds stupid but I started treating myself better and I haven\u2019t had that kind of rage since. By treating myself better i mean, not letting the voice in my head say bad things about me, judge me and make me feel like I\u2019m a nasty person. But also setting boundaries with other people and when they treat me badly they won\u2019t be able to be close enough to me to get me to that point. Another thing that I am working on now that I don\u2019t turn to rage is standing up for myself, instead of it being a fight. Say don\u2019t speak to me that way because xyz usally makes people back down rather match your frustration. \n\nNot to say I don\u2019t get into arguments anymore, I still do but I haven\u2019t thrown anything in a good 6 months and before then it was years so I think It\u2019s better. \ud83d\ude05\n\nI didn\u2019t recommend anything, there was a song I would listen to everyday it helped a lot with the depression it\u2019s called \u201ceverybody\u2019s free to wear sunscreen\u201d it\u2019s basically a musical version of a college leavers speech.
