What's going on in your head when you're quiet and still, or do you avoid that altogether? I'm wondering if you could be a Hulk, like me, always walking around enraged. Then somebody does something to give you permission to let a little out.\n\nWhen I spent some quiet time with me, I could hear the rage and sort out why. I'm also wondering how long you stayed with your therapists. I was raised in a painful household and it took a long time to figure out how to deal with the repercussions.\n\nIt just seems like you are dealing with something far deeper than a lack of control when you're angry. Oh and here's the worst and best thing a therapist ever said to me, anger isn't a real emotion. It's a cover emotion for what you're really feeling when you're too overwhelmed to process it. If you hadn't gotten that far in therapy, you may not have stuck with it long enough.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k08981/im_scared_im_going_to_lash_out_and_end_my_next/gdiluek/"}
