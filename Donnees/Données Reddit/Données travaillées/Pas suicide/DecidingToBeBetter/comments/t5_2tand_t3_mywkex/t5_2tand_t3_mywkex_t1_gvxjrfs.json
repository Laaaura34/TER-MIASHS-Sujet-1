Since I have a limited amount, I can\u2019t give everyone $5, I might decide that I want to get them $10 or $2. That\u2019s why I was saying I should gauge the situation, I would rather give someone $5 for food than to give someone $5 for drugs you know what I mean? But I definitely see where you\u2019re coming from. I come from a poverty stricken household, so I partly understand that all it takes is one bad thing to happen and you could be down in the dumps. \n\nI appreciate the advice.
