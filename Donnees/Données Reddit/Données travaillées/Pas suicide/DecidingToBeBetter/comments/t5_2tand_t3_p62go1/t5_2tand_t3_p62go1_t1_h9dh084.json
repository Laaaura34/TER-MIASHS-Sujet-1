Yeah seek therapy for that. \n\nSister.. not to blame others is okay but dont, dont blame yourself too much.. thats common misunderstanding that people had so if u dont blame someone, you need to blame urself isnt it? Its always someone to be at fault. \n\nIts hard to say this but, WE all do make mistakes. Maybe theres mistakes at him and you.. thats the truth but who cares? Shit happens. Its human thing. \n\nDont worry about blaming others.. but its what do we do about it is the big picture here. After blaming someone, do you mad at him? Forgive him? Solve the problem? Still be kind? \n\nIts your action or reaction to the situation that will determine everything. Cause at the end of the day, we all want a good ending, but we just have 2 arms, 2 legs and just A brain and heart. We cant control everything. Not even our best friends..\n\nHardest thing in life u know what? is to forgive yourself. Learn to forgive as many times as you can. Even its million trillion times. Learn to appreciate yourself. Try harder.. fail? Forgive. Try again.. fail? Forgive. Its hard but u find that it is the true happiness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p62go1/i_fall_out_of_love_every_time_i_know_the_boy/h9dh084/"}
