Once they get interested, you may no longer be interested if you are clear that they are not really your type.  You could also be resigned to the fact that they will leave anyway, or they will loose interest anyway once they \"really\" get to know you. If that is the case, getting their response maybe really uncomfortable to you and a threat. You could break up with them to avoid the threat.\n\nOne thing that can help you is to write down the answer to the question: The person I long to be in a long-term, healthy relationship with is: ........  Write down all qualities you see. Make sure you are one with that answer, that is not answered from fear or concern, but for a real love for such a person.  Then once you get interested in someone, look at your answers and see if it is a match.  If it is not, ask yourself; why am I pursuing this person if this is not a match?\n\nI hope this makes a difference for you...", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p62go1/i_fall_out_of_love_every_time_i_know_the_boy/h9drwrd/"}
