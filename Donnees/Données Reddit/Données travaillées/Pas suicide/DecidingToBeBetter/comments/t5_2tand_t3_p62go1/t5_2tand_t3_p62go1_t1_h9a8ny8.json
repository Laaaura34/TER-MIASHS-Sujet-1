Once you experience love OP, you will forget all about these prior scenarios.\n\nLove is something deeper than the fleeting experiences, and it cuts you to the core. It is something you fight for, and something you don't let slip away easy.\n\nIn regards to your latest infatuation, cut him loose.  \n\nYa, you'll hurt him... in the immediate future.\n\nBut over the long haul, he will appreciate you more instead of you just stringing him along thinking everything is advancing nicely.  \n\nIf you want to continue that friendship, this is the best way.  Just tell him straight up that you aren't interested in continuing the romantic relationship with him, but that you value his friendship immensely and wish it to continue.  Then give him time...
