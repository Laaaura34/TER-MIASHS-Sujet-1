If anything, I\u2019d argue that if you\u2019re going to do this whole \u201ccrush, followed by them liking you back, followed by you losing feelings for them\u201d thing, now\u2019s a better time than ever to do exactly that. I don\u2019t even think you need advice pertaining to this; what you need is permission so you can forgive yourself and not beat yourself up over it, and you have it because this is just how many of us find not only who we want to be with in the long-term but also ourselves. That\u2019s why you feel the way you do and are doing what you are.\n\nAlso, as for all the boys you may or may not have been hurting throughout this several-year-long process, don\u2019t fester on that if you are or feel all that bad if you do. You and I both know that you mean well and are just looking out for yourself. They\u2019ll get over it and eventually realize that they wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone who doesn\u2019t want them just as much anyway. Just go with the flow, keep doing you, and what\u2019s meant to be will be.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p62go1/i_fall_out_of_love_every_time_i_know_the_boy/h9aa1vr/"}
