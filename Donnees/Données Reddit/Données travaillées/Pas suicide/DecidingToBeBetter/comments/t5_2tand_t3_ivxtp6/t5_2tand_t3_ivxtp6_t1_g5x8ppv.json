Everyday when I come home from school or before I go to school, I am working on that goal or studying about that topic. I dont really think that its a good idea to talk to them about that. I dont need to hear their demotivating bs.  And one of the reasons why I am working so hard on my goals is because I want to move and just dont give fuck about them anymore. Thank you for your reply it helped me and I realized while I was reading it that I numbed my real self because I did not wanted to be that weirdo for them. I am not willing to do that anymore. Really Thank you\u270c\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivxtp6/need_help/g5x8ppv/"}
