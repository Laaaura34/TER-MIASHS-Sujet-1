Any given journalist wants to write what will get him or her recognized or more read. The news agencies will only select things that will produce advertising income. If somebody is not concerned about Coronavirus they won\u2019t care to read up on it because they may consider it a waste of time. If somebody is concerned about it they want validating information. This is why sensationalism of anything is what sells best; if somebody is concerned then there is something that appeals to them, if they are not concerned they don\u2019t create demand. A news agency will not garner advertising revenue for a story that nobody will read. Sorry this isn\u2019t exactly what you asked for but it explains my response: it will be hard to find amidst the saturation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/foa8b7/is_there_any_place_to_get_positiveoptimistic/flg4ro7/"}
