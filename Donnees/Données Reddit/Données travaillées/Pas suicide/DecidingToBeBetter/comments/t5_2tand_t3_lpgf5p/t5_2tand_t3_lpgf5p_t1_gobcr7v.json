It means you have healed and moved on. Otherwise, to feel joy would imply that you still harbour resentment towards these people, which isn\u2019t good for you. And even if you did feel joy, it would be short lived. Sure, there are people that relish when people get theirs after having hurt others. But I think we should remember that we all make mistakes. And those same bullies may have repented for those mistakes, and maybe have tried to be better people. You just don\u2019t know. I like to remember that we are all a product of our experiences. Those same bullies may have had parents that beat on them, or did drugs, or who knows what other shitty life experiences that made them make the choices they made. The article below really shifted my perspective on such things and I can\u2019t recommend it enough. You should be proud that you felt empathy for these people.
