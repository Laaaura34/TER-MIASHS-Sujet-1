I know what you mean about it being hard to talk out loud. As a teen I actually wrote my mom a letter about my binge eating because I didn't know how to even start discussing it.\n\nI'm a big fan of natural yogurt too - it's actually what I had for breakfast this morning!  :)   Both times that I've switched to eating fattier foods to try and help me conceive, I've gotten more energy and lost weight without trying, so perhaps you'll see similar results. Anyway, good luck working with your wife on this, and best wishes for an uneventful pregnancy and birth!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a1qy5h/emotional_eater_smoker_spender_currently_hiding/eatw7aj/"}
