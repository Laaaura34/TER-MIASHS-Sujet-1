Going out for a run or reading a few pages of a book or doing a bit of housework (less fun but still distracting) or something whenever I feel the need to smoke is a good idea :) building good habits and doing something constructive rather than destructive is the end goal.\n\nI have no weed left at present and have no intentions to buy any more, so consider the weed stopped! I usually pick up from friends and I\u2019ve let them know my intentions re. quitting so I can probably count on a bit of support there :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a1qy5h/emotional_eater_smoker_spender_currently_hiding/eatg954/"}
