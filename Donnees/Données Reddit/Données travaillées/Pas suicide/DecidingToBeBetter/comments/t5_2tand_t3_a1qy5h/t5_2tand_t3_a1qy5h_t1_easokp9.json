If your diet is that high in sugar and you've been smoking a lot of weed (dry mouth makes cavities waaayyyy worse), then that could be really bad news for your teeth.... especially if you've been in a funk and not taking very good care of your teeth (falling asleep without brushing, not flossing, missing days, etc).\n\nBasically, if you haven't seen a dentist in awhile I would definitely get in to see one.
