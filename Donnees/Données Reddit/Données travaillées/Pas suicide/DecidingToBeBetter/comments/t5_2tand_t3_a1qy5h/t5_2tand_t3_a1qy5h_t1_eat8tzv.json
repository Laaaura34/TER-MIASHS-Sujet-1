Nothing will destroy a relationship like hiding big issues like this from each other. Even if she never finds out about the debt, the smoking, etc., hiding things from each other slowly builds emotional walls and resentments that are really hard to recover from. She is your wife. She loves you. She will want to help you in any way that she can. You may be worried that you are burdening her with your problems, but as someone who has been on the flip side of this situation, hiding depression (oh yeah, you might want to talk to a therapist too while we\u2019re at it!) is a much greater burden for your partner, as it will always come out in other ways, no matter how well you think you\u2019re hiding it.
