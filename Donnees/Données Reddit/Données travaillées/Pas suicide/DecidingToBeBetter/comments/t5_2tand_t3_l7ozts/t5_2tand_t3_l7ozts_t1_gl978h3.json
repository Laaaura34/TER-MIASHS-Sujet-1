This was exactly me 4 months ago when I found out I was preggo. I tried countless times to get off weed but only succeeded in week long breaks here and there, felt quite trapped. I can gladly say I am now free of the habit, finally, and now feel hope that I can moderate and not get into the excessive routine of smoking everyday which was expensive and not enjoyable after so many years of the same. You can do it too!!!!! It\u2019s a great opportunity and time, really a necessity for your new baby\u2019s health, so I am rooting for you :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l7ozts/so_im_preggo_time_to_stop_w_the_blunts/gl978h3/"}
