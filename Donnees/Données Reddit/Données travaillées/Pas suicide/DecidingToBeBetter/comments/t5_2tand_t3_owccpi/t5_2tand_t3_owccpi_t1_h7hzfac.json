Your post sounds good and it makes a lot of sense when you're someone with a decent upbringing, not too much trauma, adequate mental health and a non-toxic living environment. It's not as easy for people with severely dysfunctional childhoods, no coping skills, mental health challenges, messed up attachment styles, unsupportive environments, etc. \n\nPeople aren't just whining because they want to have messed up lives. They're stuck in the problem because they don't know how to get out and reading \"just focus on the solution\" isn't going to help them. It takes a lot of therapy/education, dedication and commitment, mental and emotional energy, and practice to effect major changes in a person's life. Many people don't have the money, the time, the energy, or the motivation to do take on another weight when they're barely keeping their heads above water as it is. Just unlearning one self-defeating behavior can take YEARS and the urge to do it will still be there. It can take a lifetime to unlearn what doesn't work, while learning and practicing what does work.\n\nSo yeah, while I personally find it annoying to keep reading whiny posts or be around whiny people, I try to remember that they're really in pain, that they're doing the best they can, and that if I can't help them, I can at least shut the freak up and not hurt them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owccpi/self_pity_constant_crying_and_blaming_the_world/h7hzfac/"}
