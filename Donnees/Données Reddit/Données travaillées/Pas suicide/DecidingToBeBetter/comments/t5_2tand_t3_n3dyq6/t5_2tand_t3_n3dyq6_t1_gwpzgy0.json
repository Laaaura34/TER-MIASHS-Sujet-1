Depression, relationship, past trauma, etc.\n\nBody; have you gotten your annual? 44 means that your testosterone might be dipping (smoking does affect it as well).

It could very well just be that you want to become 10% better but keep doing the things you\u2019re doing right now.

All the best :)\n\n\nRemember, the time will pass anyways.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n3dyq6/how_do_you_get_that_drive/gwpzgy0/"}
