Then a person we hired at work turned out to have absolutely no filter and the filthiest mouth I've ever heard. Seeing this guy reminded me of when my parents used to tell me that I would be shocked to see a video of myself and how I acted.

And now, well, I actually really dislike when people swear, and I gotta say trying not to say \"fuck\" every day does get easier with time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6wjlil/how_can_i_control_myselfstop_being/dm9t7lk/"}
