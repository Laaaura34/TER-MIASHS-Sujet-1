After you understand your own emotions better, you can explain them to others and you'll feel slightly better.\n\nA good place to start is to ask questions about previous situations where you were screaming/swearing at your parents or anyone, and ask questions. What specifically made you feel frustrated? What were your motivations? What did you believe their motivations to be? Did you mean what you said? Could it be another frustration entirely bleeding into this one? Stuff like that.\n\nI think after knowing yourself better (not just about your frustrations) you become a calmer person. You might trust yourself more, know your limits, maybe have fewer insecurities and whatnot.\n\nHope this helps  ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6wjlil/how_can_i_control_myselfstop_being/dm8oz24/"}
