I was liked, found interesting by many, and got called up for 5-7 job interviews. Got rejected by all of them. But I found that regardless of 1 or 10 rejections, all it would take was just that one company, who would hire me, and all of a sudden, I would have a job. \n\nNow, 2,5 years later, I got into my dream job still a student, and the many rejections from my first year are now merely a proof to me that you should never give up in your search for anything. \n\nI hope it can help sparking a fire within you. Be the best you, mate, and keep working. I believe in you", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gyy2s17/"}
