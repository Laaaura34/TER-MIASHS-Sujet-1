I wasn't allowed to have income, I'm not given allowance, but i just saved anything they gave me for maybe transport or any extra money. Do that until you get a job (which will happen eventually).\n\nWhen you get your job, save up. I can't stress this enough. If you spend 10$ per month currently don't spend more than that when you get your job. If your mom or dad tried to guilt trip you into giving them your money DO NOT. You are in a life or death situation. Some people might underestimate the situation you're in. Do not. This is your future, we only have our future, you're the one who's gonna suffer the consequences and no one else. So really don't listen and put yourself first. Imagine you had a toddler and they were in danger, what would you do for them?\n\nOnce you save up, you'll start having more options, I understand it's hard to move out due to the culture but maybe consider studying abroad. There are many other places where you can find a job and tuition fees reduction. Which is enough to have a decent life.\n\nDon't give up please. I swear you deserve a much better situation. Please also understand that being in a toxic household is really draining, and you won't realize how much they were affecting your life and decisions until you move out.\n\nPlease keep reaching out and don't give up to your thoughts. It's a beautiful world out there that is not easy at all, but worth living.\n\nAlso text me if you want.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gyzxrfl/"}
