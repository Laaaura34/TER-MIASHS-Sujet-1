I hope that you finish your studies and that you get the job that you want. Also, I am sorry about your past, no child deserves to be abused. I hope that you're doing well, carrying childhood trauma is hard it makes you feel things that you shouldn't (like feeling that you aren't enough). Therapy will help you with the trauma that you're carrying.\n\nI am not Chinese btw but it's true that in many, if not all, Asian country children are pressured to be succeful. We  are expected to have a job in our 20's then start a family on our late 20's. But I know that I am not obliged to follow the \"society's timeline\". I do get pressured sometimes but I know that each had their own timeline.\n\nThank you so much for taking time to share your story. I hope you that fix your sleeping schedule and that you eat well now.\n\n I feel better now, the comments here helped a lot. I will try to fix my sleeping schedule this week and I will try to eat on schedule starting tomorrow.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gz1w5zq/"}
