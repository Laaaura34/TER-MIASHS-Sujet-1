I can totally relate with how your mom raised you (except from the physcial abuse part, my dad did hit us before but it's really rare). \n\nAlso, my dad is also like that, he is confusing!! Some days he is okay and actually shows that he cares (especially when we were younger :( ) but now he's really mentally and emotionally toxic. And he is very unsupportive. And he would also spend most of his time in his bedroom not talking to us. AND OMG HE ALSO MAKES IT AN EXCUSE THAT \"I PAY THE BILLS SO YOU DO THE REST\".\n\nMy sister and I would do the household chores. I also parented my younger sister. I started cooking meals at the age of 9.\n\nAnd you're totally right, family should be the one who protects but the truth is sometimes they are the ones who hurt us.\n\nI AM SURPRISED BY OUR SIMILARITIES. And woah I am so proud of you. I am glad that you're taking therapy right now. I pray and I hope that the day will come that you're finally free from your childhood traumas. I wish you a happy life. I am happy that youre doing better now. \n\nThank you so so much, it feels like I am reading a message from my future self (sorry it's just that we really have similarities). Once, I have money I will also try therapy because I know that I badly need one.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gz1uxmv/"}
