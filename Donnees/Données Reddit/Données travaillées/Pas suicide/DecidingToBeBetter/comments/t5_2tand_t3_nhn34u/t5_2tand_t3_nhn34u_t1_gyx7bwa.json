You are currently living in a toxic environment. Fortunately, you are old enough to make your decisions and move out, but you first need to find a job. Keep trying every single day, no matter how many times you are denied a job. Don\u2019t rely on your parents to support you, it\u2019s not going to happen. Once you have a job, mail out for your school transcript and move out of the toxic environment. I hope it all works out for you. I hope you will find the courage and confidence to make a change.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gyx7bwa/"}
