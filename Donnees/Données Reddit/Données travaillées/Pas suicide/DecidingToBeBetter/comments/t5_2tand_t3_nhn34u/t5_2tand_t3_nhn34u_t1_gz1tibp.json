Also, I don't know much about independent study groups but if it's something that'll cost me money, I don't think I can. Right now, I am actually studying another language  and so far I can see progress. Hopefully, once I am fluent, I can use it on my future career.\n\nThank you so much!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gz1tibp/"}
