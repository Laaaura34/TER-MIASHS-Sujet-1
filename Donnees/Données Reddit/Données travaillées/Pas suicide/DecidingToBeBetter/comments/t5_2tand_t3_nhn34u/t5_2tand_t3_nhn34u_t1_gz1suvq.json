I actually don't talk to her and don't let her leech on us anymore. I already deleted her from my social media. I said \"in the process of cutting her off\" because I am not sure if I should also cut off my relatives from her side (which my sister did). \n\nI contemplated a lot last night, and I decided to just focus on looking for a job right now. My goal is to move out of here (next year if I already can). I am thankful (for providing food and shelter for us) and I do care about my dad but I won't lie if I say that he is emotionally and mentally toxic. I know that I won't grow in an enviroment like this so I wilk just save money then try to love out and finance my own education.\n\nI am now waiting for my job interview. Incase, I dont get accepted here, I will try again. The pandemic is making it harder for me, I almost got a job but it was cancelled because of the lockdown.\n\nAnyway, thank you so much for your time. It really helped clear my mind.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gz1suvq/"}
