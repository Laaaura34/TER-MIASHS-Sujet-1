But last night made it clear that I can't rely on him anymore. I am still thankful that he provides for our needs (well, that's his responsibility but, still, I am thankful).\n\nAlso, I am sorry about your parent. It's tough growing up with one parent, it must've been hard on you but I am glad that you seem to be doing okay now. Thank you for sharing your story, it inspires me.\n\nAnd you're right. I will now focus on finding a job and hopefully I can move out next year! I will post an update here when I get the job!\n\nThank you so much, you really helped me with making a decision.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gz1rno4/"}
