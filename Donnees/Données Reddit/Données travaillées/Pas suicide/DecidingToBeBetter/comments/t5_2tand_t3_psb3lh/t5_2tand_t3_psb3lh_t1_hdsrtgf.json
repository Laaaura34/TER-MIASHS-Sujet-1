I'm glad you have supportive people. Just know it doesn't have to be this way forever. Just like you improve on your singing, you can practice self-love and acceptance. One day you can be brave enough, and sometimes you just have to take a small leap. Maybe look up other singer's biography/journey, I'm sure many struggle with the above? And talk to your family about your concerns, they can give you another perspective.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psb3lh/why_cant_i_believe_it/hdsrtgf/"}
