I noticed this was especially the case when I was more depressed than not. When I mostly gamed, life didn't really matter to me. They're both pretty much simulations so why do I care if I play the ''real life simulation'' or World of Warcraft?\n\nWhat got me out was not gaming anymore, I sold my gaming PC, WoW got redundant so I'm here exploring the world. I feel absolutely uninterested, but by forcing myself to do things, I regained my interest in life. \n\nNot sure if this helps. But perhaps you could elaborate on your daily activities more.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1t7n3/i_want_to_be_restless/h8fhl84/"}
