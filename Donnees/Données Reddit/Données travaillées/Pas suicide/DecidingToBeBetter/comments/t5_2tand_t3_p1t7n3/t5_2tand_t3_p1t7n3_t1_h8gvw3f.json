I am several years clean from a bad drug addiction, and after countless rehabs and meetings at AA and such this is the kind of thing that really changed how I felt about life in general after that.  If you have true freedom to do this kind of thing, I highly recommend it.  I was blessed enough to have the opportunity to just relentlessly try new shit for a solid couple of months and I didn't find what I ultimately loved doing in that short time, but it certainly put me on the path of seeking what truly makes me tick, and here I am still going strong years later.  I don't like to call it restless, and that honestly reminds me how exhausting it is to be so ambitious and hard working, but looking back I can easily see it's sooooo worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Formatting", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1t7n3/i_want_to_be_restless/h8gvw3f/"}
