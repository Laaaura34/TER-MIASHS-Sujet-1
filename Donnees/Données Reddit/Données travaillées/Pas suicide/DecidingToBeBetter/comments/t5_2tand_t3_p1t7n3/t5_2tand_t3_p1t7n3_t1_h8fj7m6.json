Then I try to study till noon (saying \"try\" bc I'll end up on reddit/ pinterest) then I go for a drive and when I come back I start studying again till about 4 or 5 when I work out. Then I study again till about an hour or two before bed time where I just sort of exist.\n\nYou'll notice that although there is a lot of dedicated study time, I gotta say, a lot of it is just me having y material open and glancing at it as I scroll through the web \n\nI don;t have any friends to meet up with, and I'm still living with my parents as a teen so I'm not allowed to go anywhere", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1t7n3/i_want_to_be_restless/h8fj7m6/"}
