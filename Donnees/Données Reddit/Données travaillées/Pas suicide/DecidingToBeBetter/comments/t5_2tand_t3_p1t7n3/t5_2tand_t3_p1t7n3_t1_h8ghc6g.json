It\u2019s by a professor at Yale. One of the biggest oh wow-moments I\u2019ve had while listening was when they covered the fact that people feel better, are more content and find more meaning in doing things for others than for themselves. Focusing on ourselves seems logical in this time and age but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s how we\u2019re wired or what we need to find the spark. Maybe that\u2019s something to investigate? The feeling of meaningfulness in life can change absolutely everything, but I think many of us lack it.
