I started off deciding that I would turn them off at 9pm and then I completely stopped using one of them at night. I do use my phone at night sometimes, or when I wake up too early and cannot fall asleep. I think that is okay, though.\n\nI would suggest locking your device in a box if you think that it would be difficult to quit using. Stick a message on the key that\u2019ll deter you from using it. Don\u2019t drag it around with you all the time and instead leave it at home more often. Maybe delete some of your social media, you could also try to get your phone to lock if you use it for more than an hour or so per day [I don\u2019t know if you can do that, but you could try].\n\nYou could make a calendar and add smiley faces/sad faces to indicate which days you successfully managed to not use your phone very often.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pd3mst/struggling_to_stay_off_my_phone/haneive/"}
