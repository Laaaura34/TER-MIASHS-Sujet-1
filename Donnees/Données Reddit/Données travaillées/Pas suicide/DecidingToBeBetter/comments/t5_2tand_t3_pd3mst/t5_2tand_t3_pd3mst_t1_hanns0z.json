This helps especially at night, since i always go on my phone before bed and ending up going to bed really late lol. Another thing you could try is taking a break from one of your most used apps and only checking them (if you need to) on your computer or somewhere else. I deleted Instagram off my phone for a bit and my screen time went way down (i ended up getting it back, but bc I deleted it I go on it way less now!!) I hope I was able to help a bit, good luck with controlling your screen time, I believe in u !!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pd3mst/struggling_to_stay_off_my_phone/hanns0z/"}
