I was advised to switch to Sociology as there are more job opportunities- teaching, HR, guidance counselor, mental health counseling, etc. However, the only thing in that field that interests me is social work and the pay sucks haha. I am already out of college and hold a bachelor's in sociology so I can't change that. But there's an accelerated BSN program that I have been accepted to where I can be a nurse in 14 months. Between everything, the schooling is about 55k, so I've been trying to weigh my options. \n\nThanks for your post!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m052ad/sociology_major/gqeppf8/"}
