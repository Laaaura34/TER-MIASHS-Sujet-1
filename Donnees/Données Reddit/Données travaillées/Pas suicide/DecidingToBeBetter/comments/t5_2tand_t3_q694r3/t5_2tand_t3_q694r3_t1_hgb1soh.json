For instance, my library uses Libby (via Overdrive), which gives access to e-books, audiobooks, e-magazines, e-comic books. When I'm looking for a new book, I'll search by author or genre, skim a few of the results, and pick whichever grabs my attention. This way, you have access to a lot of books, you can take your time picking, and you save money/travel-time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q694r3/i_have_decided_that_i_want_to_be_wellread_and/hgb1soh/"}
