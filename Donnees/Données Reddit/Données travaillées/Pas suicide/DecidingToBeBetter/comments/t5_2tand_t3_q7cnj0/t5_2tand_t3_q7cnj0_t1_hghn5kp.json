If I ever have to send my child to a psychiatrist, I sure hope it's someone who really wants the job, are dedicated to what they're are doing and last, but not least, understand how it is to fight for something and having a hard time.

They haven't walked the same road you have, they haven't met the same obstacles. We are all individuals, and comparing ourselves with others helps no one but the little troll in the back of your head telling you you are not good enough.
