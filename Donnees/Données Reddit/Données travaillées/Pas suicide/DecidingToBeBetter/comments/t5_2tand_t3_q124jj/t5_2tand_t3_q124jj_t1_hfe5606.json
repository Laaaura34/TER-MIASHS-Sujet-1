You're going to be the same person in another location. I highly encourage you find a therapist to help you work through this, I've done a lot of this work myself and I waited WAYYYYYY longer than you did to reach out, so kudos to you! I didn't start working on myself and trying to answer the questions you posed above until I was 35! I'm 44 now and I am obsessed with my life, I promise this is available for you as well! And you're SO young, it's a great gift to give yourself. If you're not open to therapy, I'd encourage you to buy the book You can heal your life by Louise Hay. It's too woo-woo, but a little. It changed my life and has changed thousands of others. If you're not in a position to purchase the book, let me know and I'll hook you up with it. Above all, it's okay to be not be okay sometimes. And this is a great invitation for you to learn how to clean this up while you still have your entire life in front of you. If I were you, I'd put myself through a self-love bootcamp...learn how to love yourself and make that your number one goal. Buy the books, learn the things, and do the work. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q124jj/i_hate_that_reddit_and_random_strangers_is/hfe5606/"}
