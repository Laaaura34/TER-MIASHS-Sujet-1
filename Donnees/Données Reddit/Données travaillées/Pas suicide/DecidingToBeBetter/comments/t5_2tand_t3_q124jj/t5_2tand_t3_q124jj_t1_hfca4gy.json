Some days are hard. \n\nMy only advice as a fellow human is to take each moment as it comes. This day, this moment is what you have. I find that if I take one thing that makes me happy today and hold it close, that I can cling to that and it can bring me joy. Whether it just be Journaling, creating, walking, napping, going for a fancy coffee or decluttering something- that thing can bring me joy. \n\nWe each have our struggles. You may look at someone who seems to have it all together and have their life figured out, but they may be hurting inside as much as you are. Don't compare your life to another person's. No one is truly 100% at peace and settled into life. \n\nYou do not have to have it all figured out. Life is a journey, not a destination.  That may sound cliche, but it is true. You can walk through life broken and that is okay. You can have no idea where life will lead you, and that is okay. You can have tons of friends or no friends and that is okay. You make your own joy and set your own goals. Your goal may be as simple as taking a walk today and enjoying the outdoors. It doesn't have to be grandiose. \n\nLife is a series of moments. Sometimes we need to scale it back and remember that. \n\nI hope you find your peace and purpose in life. Remember to find joy in the little things, they are the big things truly.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q124jj/i_hate_that_reddit_and_random_strangers_is/hfca4gy/"}
