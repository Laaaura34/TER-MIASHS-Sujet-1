It's not an easy thing even with a throw-away account to share openly.\n\nI'd love to provide another perspective for you to consider moving forward.\n\nFulfillment in life is something that I've studied extensively and feel strongly about what I'm about to tell you.\n\nSocial media has tainted the perception of happiness and true fulfillment and it has contributed to us comparing our \"menial\" lives (perception is critical here) to others' glamorous life.\n\nBut I can say for a fact, that these people may give off the impression of being fulfilled but in reality, most are not and will not be.\n\nMany think money is the source of this happiness but this is an external thing.\n\nAnd that's the new perspective, that anything external isn't going to bring you true happiness and fulfillment.\n\nYou're your own person and you have your own journey of self-discovery to undertake.\n\nMany get on into later life or to the end of the road and realize they don't even know the most basic of information about themselves internally.\n\nBut I also don't blame them because it's not an easy discovery to undertake and not one easily undertaken alone.\n\nLuckily for you, you are still very young and I'm sure you're sick of hearing it but you have plenty of time.\n\nHopefully, this helps you on your journey of self-discovery.
