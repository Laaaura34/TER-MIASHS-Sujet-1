I hate being depressed. Everyone hates a depressed person. My mom tries to help, we always end up in fights. I feel guilty of just existing and being a burden tbh\n\nAnd I have bad social skills. I'm awkward. And I think I'm literally stupid, more or less. My appearance too\n\nThings that I love about me are my empathy. I love being caring and empathetic person, I always want to support people when I'm in the mood to do so. I want to help out people as much as I'm able to and I hate hurting people. I love listening to music too if that counts\n\nAnd what I will be when I'm comfortable with me.. I don't exactly have an idea. I guess, I'm able to sit with myself. I'll be able to enjoy hobbies again, I'm not dead inside with no passion for anything. I'm disciplined. I'll be able to make connections with people. I'll be able to accept compliments freely without constantly assuming this person is lying. I can call friends and hang out with them and have fun. Maybe I'm producing music too\n\nI know it's ok to be in progress but I'm wondering if I really am? Idk, feels like I'm stuck and trapped and I am desperate for a way out", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q124jj/i_hate_that_reddit_and_random_strangers_is/hfdqr5q/"}
