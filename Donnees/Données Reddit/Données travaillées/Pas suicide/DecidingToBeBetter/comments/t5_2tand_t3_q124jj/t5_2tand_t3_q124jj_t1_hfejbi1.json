Medication can help, but doesn\u2019t always, and almost never quickly. All I can say for sure is that time changes everything. The way you picture things are not how they will be. Things you can\u2019t even imagine will happen and change you and how you perceive things. That\u2019s part of life. Nothing is permanent, good feelings or bad. \n\nI have a lot of issues in regards to the way I live my life. I feel as though I live it in a meaningless and wasteful way. But I\u2019m able to find moments of happiness where everything feels right, and if you feel them, bask in them. Savor them and retain the feeling. I have one of my partner and our dog just laying in our bed that\u2019s been getting me through this year. \n\nBe patient, resilient, and do the things you don\u2019t want to. The discomfort is worth the limitless possibilities it creates.
