I'd honestly start with YouTube just to get the ball rolling (like Psych2Go is an amazing channel to learn more about yourself and your feelings), but going to therapy is where the real progress happens imo. Try doing research of affordable therapy options online or near you. And btw it's totally okay to take time to wallow in misery -- I've had a few days recently where I just cried or laid on the flooring thinking things over -- it's good to feel everything, but it also know when you're ready to start taking action to feel better.
