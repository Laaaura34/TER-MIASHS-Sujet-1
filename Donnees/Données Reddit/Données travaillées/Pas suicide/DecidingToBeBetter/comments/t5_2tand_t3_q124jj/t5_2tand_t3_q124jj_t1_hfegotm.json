It may feel like you're old/late to the game, but you're 18, and it's 100% normal to still be figuring things out. I'm 30 and entirely still figuring out who I am and what I want to do with my life. I recently quit my job as a corporate lawyer to start a YouTube channel focused on mindset, mental health, and productivity -- aka decided to say I'm moving away from 12 years of effort towards one direction and switch paths.\n\nBut that's not to invalidate how you are feeling. I'm sorry you feel empty and not fulfilled. Two thoughts: (1) think about the stories you tell yourself, about who you are, what your limits are, and what you should/shouldn't do. You are the author of your own story and if you can change your story (self-talk, internal narratives, etc.), you can change your life. (2) Try to commit just improving yourself 1% each day or each week. Think about your biggest obstacle or stress that you don't have an answer to, and seek out an answer like a master detective -- watch YouTube videos, read articles, read books, read Reddit posts until you feel like you know what to do to start making gradual progress. Perfection isn't the goal, but gradual progress so that you can enjoy the journey of who you are becoming.\n\nLast thing: know that there are millions of people out there who believe in you, share in your struggles, and hope for the best for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q124jj/i_hate_that_reddit_and_random_strangers_is/hfegotm/"}
