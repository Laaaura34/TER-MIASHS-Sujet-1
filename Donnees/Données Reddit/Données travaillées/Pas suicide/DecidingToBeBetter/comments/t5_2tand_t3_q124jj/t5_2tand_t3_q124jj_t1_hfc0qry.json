I can't offer much comfort other than saying that I felt in a really similar situation to you when I was 17/18. I had really bad depression and honestly couldn't see a way out of it or believe that I could ever be happy - or deserve to be. I still go through periods of feeling like that, but believe me it does get better. Time heals.\n\n18 is a really difficult age when people expect a lot of you. No one really has their shit together then and those that say they do are lying. I am 29 and most people I know still have no idea what they are doing. I know lots of 40 yo's who still have no idea who they are or what they want from life. That's normal and it's ok. There are probably lots of older people on here who are in the same position as you but are 40 years older!\n\nI don't know which country you've moved to, but do you have a doctor you can go to to ask about mental health care or anti-depressants? That might help if the therapists haven't been useful.\n\nSending lots of Internet hugs your way: I really hope you feel better soon because you deserve happiness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q124jj/i_hate_that_reddit_and_random_strangers_is/hfc0qry/"}
