Not sure why but I cried like a baby after reading your comment. I so  love to see you not being in this place that I am\n\nI think I could have phrased that better. I haven't moved yet - but I thought about it a lot. Because my home country sucks as I'm seeing it.

If I could access help I would've done it already.\n\nNo one's to guarantee anything, I see people feeling depressed from 16-40 and it scares me a lot that what if im still the same til then. \nand I am aware there are a lot of people in my shoes at any age. \n\nI just, yeah I'm unsure about all of it.
