You have to face that. My anger is only extinguished by understanding. Understanding why x person did x thing to the best of my ability, and even asking them. Again facing it. Whatever it takes because you matter and you don\u2019t have to feel like this. Anger is also a valid human emotion. Allow yourself to feel it too. Therapy won\u2019t help you if your not going to fully open up and do the work, but therapy is also not a requirement to get this anger lifted. \n\nTherapy helps you open the door, but you have to walk through it and do the work every step of the way. I think there is this idea out there that therapists are supposed to fix you. They give you blueprints, help you untie mental knots, but ultimately you need to apply the effort to reach your goal. It won\u2019t happen any other way and there is no cheat code. You have to take ownership of your feelings and be willing to overturn every grimy and dirty symbolic mental freaking rock in your mind. It\u2019s so hard sometimes, but it\u2019s so worth it to feel lighter than you ever have and navigate life with a clearer and brighter lens. When the future starts to feel good, you\u2019re on the path. \n\nI feel for you. The only way to not feel the same every day is to do something different.
