As depression deepens,  energy and motivation often drop.  Also, negative thinking increases, which is part of the illness.  Maybe the best ways to help (if your friend is open to it) are to keep up contact with him, visit fairly often, and invite him to come with you to socialize with others, which is easier if he already knows some of the people.   Invite him to participate in activities or to exercise with you (start small).  He will need support and understanding, acceptance from you and others.  Every now and then you can ask a question that encourages him to think about something positive.  If he isn't already seeing a therapist, you might see how he would feel about seeing one, as that can really help.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovy2v9/what_should_a_person_with_no_interests_do/h7csurh/"}
