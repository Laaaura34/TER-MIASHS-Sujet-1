If so (and enough self aware) from experience I can recommend: doing nothing! But observe yourself closely, like a good friend. See, what is the first thing you grab for? If it is eating, while you are already full, a cigarette when you just smoked, another drink when you already had like 4... then it is distraction and if you can, wait longer. If sitting in a spot does not help, you can try writing your thoughts any time you feel like doing nothing.. it will make sense I promise that. If any anxiety, harming thoughts come forward I do recommend consultation/ mental coach. But not everyone has some \"disorder\" if they are stuck in life. I saw pretty \"normal\" people have that as well, and there is nothing to feel bad about. So much to do actually and so little time. What do I give meaning, what will I ignore? How do I want to spend my time where I can practice free choice? Noone else can answer that question but yourself.
