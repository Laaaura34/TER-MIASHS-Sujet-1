Sure! \n\nTaking advantage of the  asymmetries in life is in reference to risk/reward. Certain things provide high reward for little risk. This is very much emphasized in investing in stocks but I believe can be applied to everything else in life. \n\nYou could also call it working smart. An example would be lifting a Boulder with your bare hands rather than a lever. Risk involved is injury. Reward is successfully moving the boulder away from say an entrance/exit. \n\nThis is still an advice which I haven\u2019t had much experience with but has a lot of wisdom and potential to improve one\u2019s quality of life if you\u2019re able to fully comprehend it. \n\nThere are lots of asymmetries in life when it comes to opportunities.
