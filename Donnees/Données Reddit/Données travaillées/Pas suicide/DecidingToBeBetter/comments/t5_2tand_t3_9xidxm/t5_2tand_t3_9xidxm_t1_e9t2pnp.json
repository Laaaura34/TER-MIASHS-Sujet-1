Take pleasure in the little things, living the simple life. Freinds, family, health and having some kind of purpose/direction accounts for 90% of our happiness. We are very conditioned to be competitive and want money since we are pitted against each other in a rat race. It's wrong and unnatural to put material things above humanity. But if we just chill, be kind, understanding and non-judgemental towards each other and unapologetically being our authentic self, then others around us will also relax too.
