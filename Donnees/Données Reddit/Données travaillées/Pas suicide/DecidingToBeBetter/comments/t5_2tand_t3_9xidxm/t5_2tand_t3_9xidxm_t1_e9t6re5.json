The odds of such an event happening are far less likely than, say, getting hit by a stray piece of space debris.  Plus, I don't often give away even small amounts of cash to what has to be one of the great scams of all time (Powerball/Mega).  \n\nBut yes....there are certain people that you should be denied!  Denied money, certainly, and perhaps breathable air as well.  The post internet world is dominated by people who think that they are worth a premium.  Whether it be Apple who sells 10% better products for double their worth or Whole Foods who rakes in the cash from millennials and over privileged of all backgrounds.\n\nEven today, without the means granted by such a windfall I get my little victories by informing people that what they have is not worth anything to me.  For example....I can only watch one TV at a time so why would I have more than one?  And on top of that, why would it need to be 70\"?  My vehicle.....an older Honda....does exactly what I need it to...paid in cash....only bought after my last one got too old to cart my white ass to work every day.....so why would I spend 30+K when I got what I need for less than 10?  \n\nSame goes for everything else....not interested in giving resources to people who make their living selling useless things...and....remember this...these same people that we all line up to give our money to....well..they wouldn't give you or me yesterday's newspaper.  So....\"F\" them!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9xidxm/just_a_few_of_the_nuggets_of_wisdom_ive/e9t6re5/"}
