I don't want cars, yachts, a big house or anything like that.\n\n  If anything, since I would have plenty of spare time, if I had that kind of money I would shop for everything at the Salvation Army and Goodwill....and I would haggle with them endlessly....until they were just so tired and yearning to go home that they let me have the toaster oven for $1.50 instead of $2.75.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would also have the time to grab every freebie and clip every coupon possible.  And if I really had a yearning for a nice dinner out....well, my investment banker would then have the opportunity to demonstrate how much he or she appreciates my business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone who chided me for my stinginess and told me that I should spend some of the money would get a one fingered salute and an invitation to do something vile with a root vegetable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think most of the other points are valid though.
