I\u2019ve been a daily user for over 2 years and whenever I want to quit and try to commit to it I will fall asleep at the drop of a hat. At this point, I just use enough to get to work and get my job done. I sleep almost every night and I have been a good person throughout my use but would like to stop. Because I love my girfriend and her kids, I\u2019d like to be around for years to come and not be a bad influence on the young ones.
