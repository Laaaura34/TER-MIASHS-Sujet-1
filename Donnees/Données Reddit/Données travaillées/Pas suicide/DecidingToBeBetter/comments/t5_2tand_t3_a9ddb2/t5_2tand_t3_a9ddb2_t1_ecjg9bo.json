I'm not hooked bad but my best friend does it on a daily basis. Normally I go over there a few times a week but I've cut back to only going one or two times a month. And yes I do it while I'm there which is why I didn't have a choice but to cut how often I went over there. We had so much fun drawing, painting, etc. i just remember how much it makes me feel like crap, going without sleep, and how much weight I lose when I'm on it so it's easier for me to choose health over high. I have a good job making good money so that helps me stay clean and Kratom is a big help for me. I take Kratom three times a day.
