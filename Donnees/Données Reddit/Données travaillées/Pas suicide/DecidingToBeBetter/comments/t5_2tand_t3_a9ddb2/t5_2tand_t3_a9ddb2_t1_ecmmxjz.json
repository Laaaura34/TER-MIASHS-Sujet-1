I have a buddy who struggled with addiction. DMT and other psychadelics, exercise and clean eating worked really well for him to kick the bad stuff. Maybe consider not waiting a while to try the DMT, because Iv heard that works really well. Look into ayahuasca retreats, so it can be administered properly and safely. From what I hear a lot of these retreats host addicts to specifically help them with clearing addiction. I have only done DMT  but not ayahuasca but I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s a great healing medicine as well", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a9ddb2/day_1_of_quitting_meth_wish_me_luck/ecmmxjz/"}
