This natural, sober comfort is the true goal. I am truly rooting for you because you decided to post your commitment to quitting on a most unique Christmas, the 2018 December 25th day. Never another will be like it. Let's move ever forward Dave, into the sober yet beautiful, reliable, and lucid freedom of the near-future day to day experience. As the top comment saysm, it cannot be stressed how important it is to always associate crystal use with negative consequences, pain and suffering and regret, whatever works for you. If you cannot maintain this attitude and association with the enemy then you need to go to NA meetings to inspire this understanding and maturity towards your drug abuse. Hearing how others are battling can be profoundly healing and helpful towards one's own addiction battle...if you're truly ready Dave, the help is out there,  if you look for it. A Most Merry Christmas, fellow Addict, may we find the true comfort of sobriety quickly and efficiently.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a9ddb2/day_1_of_quitting_meth_wish_me_luck/ecinulv/"}
