I'm 22 and was introduced to it at 18 basically the same way you were, hanging out with the wrong people. After the first time I didn't use it again until about a month after my 19th birthday and it's pretty much been a down hill spiral ever since. I've been to the hospital twice during come down days because of anxiety attacks so severe i thought I was dying. My best friend that we basically just used each other for drugs (if he was dry I hooked him up and vice versa) just got locked up for it. I had to block him on all social media last month when I decided to try quitting (for the third time) and I had an urge to do it this week that I couldn't shake so I unblocked him and messaged with no reply. I asked another friend of mine what was up with him and he gave me the news. It fucking devastated me. I ended up fucking up and buying a bag and just finished it this morning and I already regret it. I was 5 weeks clean.  Just get the fuck away from your friends that do it, block them on everything and don't think you'll be able to hang out with them and say no, even if they don't offer it out of respect for you, you'll know they have it and ask yourself. Best of luck to you man.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a9ddb2/day_1_of_quitting_meth_wish_me_luck/ed9n3el/"}
