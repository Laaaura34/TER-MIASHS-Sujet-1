I battled an addiction with opiates myself, I know how shitty life immediately feels without it. But being able to get your life back is a ton more important than using a drug that you're wasting it on. If you feel your urges coming on, keep in mind there is always therapy and some medication to help with drug withdrawals. Helped me a ton to really start fixing the reasons why I was on drugs. Wishing you the best! Merry Christmas \u2661", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a9ddb2/day_1_of_quitting_meth_wish_me_luck/ecj030n/"}
