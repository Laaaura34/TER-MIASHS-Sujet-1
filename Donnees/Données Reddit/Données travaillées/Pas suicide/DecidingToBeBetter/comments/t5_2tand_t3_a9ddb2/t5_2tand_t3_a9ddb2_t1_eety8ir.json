You got a lot of goals for this year. I want you to know that it is okay if you dont succeed in all of the goals you set for yourself. It can create a lot of pressure that may make you have urges to escape again. Know that just being sober, everyday, is such a huge victory. Keep that in your mind constantly, and say it to yourself out loud everyday. That way, when the going gets tough and life starts to happen, you still have a little positivity in your day. I hope you meet all of your goals, just as i do mine, but everyday sober is a bigger victory than you had everyday last year, and that is beautiful in and of itself", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a9ddb2/day_1_of_quitting_meth_wish_me_luck/eety8ir/"}
