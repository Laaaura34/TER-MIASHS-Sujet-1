I felt the need to tell that story. As I was going through it, I was trying to describe to my fiance the way it felt inside and what I was going through. I had real motivation to get over my addiction but it felt like I wasn't getting anywhere for so long and I would get discouraged and think about giving up. One day at a time is what I kept telling myself, and one foot in front of the other. Most days it was a struggle to even stand up and get through the day. It was such a long walk and one day it did get better and continued to do so. Now it feels like the world is at my grasp and I can do whatever I want with my day without thinking about drugs nonstop. It is such a release when it finally happens and I just want people to know that no matter how long the journey there is light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you again and best of luck to you as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m8p3ud/being_sober_is_beautiful/griwk1e/"}
