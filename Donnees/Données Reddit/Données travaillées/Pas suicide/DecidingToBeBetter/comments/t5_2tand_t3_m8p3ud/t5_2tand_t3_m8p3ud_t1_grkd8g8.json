I don\u2019t need them mentally at all anymore... I just use them to function, because without them I am physically destroyed within 24hrs.\n\nBut, I see no way out. I\u2019ve spoke with doctors and they really don\u2019t seem to care that much. You\u2019d have no idea if you met me, most likely, that I am on a hell of a lot opiates... but I sure as hell would like not to be.\n\nIt\u2019s wearing me down.\n\nAnyway,\nCongratulations to you!\nI hope I can get to where you are someday.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m8p3ud/being_sober_is_beautiful/grkd8g8/"}
