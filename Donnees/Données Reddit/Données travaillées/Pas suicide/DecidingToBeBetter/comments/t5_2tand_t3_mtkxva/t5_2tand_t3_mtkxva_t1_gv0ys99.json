It made me miserable but I didn\u2019t see the point. I realize now just how crazy I was making myself. Not to mention, it\u2019s way easier to keep a house clean once you get it there and don\u2019t let it get to be a total mess.\n\nSomething that really helped me was adopting a mindset that what matters is just doing something consistently even if it\u2019s not done perfectly. Taking one dirty cup towards the kitchen is still better than nothing.\n\nA few other tips, I follow Clean Mama\u2019s weekly routine. It\u2019s easy (a few daily tasks plus a weekly task). And again, the key isn\u2019t perfection. It\u2019s just doing something. Spending even just 5 minutes a week cleaning up the bathroom adds up over time. The other things I try to make a habit of are spending 5-10 mins a day putting things away and whenever I leave a room, I try to grab something that doesn\u2019t belong and take it closer to where it does belong.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mtkxva/i_decided_to_start_doing_chores_not_because_i/gv0ys99/"}
