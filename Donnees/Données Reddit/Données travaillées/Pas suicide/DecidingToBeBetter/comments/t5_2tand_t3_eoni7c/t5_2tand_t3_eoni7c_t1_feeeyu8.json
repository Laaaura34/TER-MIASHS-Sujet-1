I was in your boat and I never stopped, now I\u2019m 25. I\u2019m doing fine and about to graduate with a good bachelor\u2019s degree, but I have no doubt in my mind that I\u2019d be in a much better place if I didn\u2019t spend my early 20s high so often.\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve been able to resist other potential addictions and that you\u2019ve realized this issue early in your life. It\u2019s not too late to fix it and turn things around. If you like weed, maybe in the future you can test your relationship with it again, just be careful.
