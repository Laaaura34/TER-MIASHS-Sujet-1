I smoked every day for 6 years. I do credit it to helping me graduate and getting through some rough days. But lately it had just turned into a hinderance. I lost jobs and prevented getting jobs because of weed. I turned homeless due to weed. All that and it still wasnt enough to quit. For good, I mean. I had lots..oh god so many..of \u2018last hits\u2019. \n\nThen I started getting paranoid and weird feelings when I smoked, which I never had the 6 years of smoking. Found out it was due to being prescribed anti-depressant/anxiety meds that actually worked. A few months of trying to feel good after smoking, after being on these meds, and I decided fuck it I need these meds to work, its not worth it anymore. And I havn\u2019t smoked in about 3 months now.\n\nIt\u2019s still hard for me sometimes. I miss being high. I really do. \n\nHaving the same struggle with alcohol. Relapsed last week with that. It\u2019s harder with alcohol for me, because its ever-where; at restaurants, in every movie, tv show.\n\nI don\u2019t normally want to smoke until I smell it out in public then its like ohhhh goooooood pleeease. \n\nI\u2019m really happy that I\u2019m able to be happy without weed now tho. I mean, I need a pill now...but I think the benefits weigh out the cons.\n\nI was just always waiting for the next bowl..if I had weed, I determined my life to be good, even while freezing and starving and homeless. Just gotta make it to the next high..\n\nIn a perfect world I could stay at home, drop my meds, and toke 24/7...but thats not an option.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eoni7c/deciding_to_quit_weed_heres_my_story_and_how_weed/fef70fg/"}
