The primary reason is wanting to be the best version of myself I can possibly be and I think that's a goal everyone should strive for. Previously, I didn't value life much at all and honestly thought I'd be better off dead (really stupid and incorrect thing to tell yourself btw). Something beautiful about life is that you get to mold who you are as a person, you write your own story. Everybody makes poor choices throughout their lives at one point or another. If you repeat the poor choices don't beat yourself up over it, it's better to just pick yourself up again and move forward. Knowledge is power, learn from your mistakes. Power over yourself is underrated. Appreciate the small things and enjoy your journey. \n\nWishing you success ! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eoni7c/deciding_to_quit_weed_heres_my_story_and_how_weed/fei8ji4/"}
