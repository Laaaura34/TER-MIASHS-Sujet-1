After 9 years of basically daily smoking. I had quit for a month at a time here and there but never of my own volition. It was because I had moved or needed to get a new job. Quitting of your own volition is harder, but so much more satisfying. Sobriety is incredible and I guarantee you'll love it. I'm actually reading again, cooking, exercising, journaling, and meditating again. All of those were replaced with weed and video games/youtube.\n\nFor me I had to throw away everything and delete numbers. When it's not there its much easier to quit. Never put yourself in the same room as weed if you can help it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eoni7c/deciding_to_quit_weed_heres_my_story_and_how_weed/feenzyv/"}
