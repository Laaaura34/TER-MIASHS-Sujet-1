I really liked the way you talked about your journey and I could really feel it, specially the part of only keeping the things you need or really love. This is something I decided to do as well, because I had a recent period in my life where I would buy clothes and objects I didn't need or fell in love with just so I ended up not even using. Recently, realizing I have so much stuff, I decided I'd make things simple and minimal. I don't know if you did this already but something that really helped me was to make a realistic and practical list of my \"ideal belongings\", like \"ideal wardrobe\", \"ideal kitchen\", \"ideal collection of make-up\", \"ideal itens of decoration\", etc. I could only list things that were 100% worth the money, which means I would use them frequently, would actually like to, wouldn't be too expansive, wouldn't be too hard to find and would LAST (because sooo many clothes I had were poor made althought their price was unrealistic high, so they would eventually just not be usable anymore). When I go out, I can only buy what's on this list. I'm still in this last part of the process. It should be a thing you do as certain situations arise and you end up needing to buy them, just to make sure you ACTUALLY need what's on the list. Anyway, hope this helps somewhat, thanks a lot for your post \u2661", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iwy36i/my_1month_journey_so_far/g679o1i/"}
