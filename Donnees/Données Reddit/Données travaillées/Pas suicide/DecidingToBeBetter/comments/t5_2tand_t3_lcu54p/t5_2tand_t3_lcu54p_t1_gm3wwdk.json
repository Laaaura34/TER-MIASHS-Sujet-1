I got thrown right into antidepressants which I was terrified of, but now things are really starting to get better. It's going to be a very long journey, but sticking with it and pushing through is definitely worth it. I also had the feeling of not being able to \"fix\" my issues, but I think a lot of people have that feeling starting out. Even just deciding to go to therapy is a huge step. I wish you all the best on your journey!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lcu54p/tomorrow_is_my_first_day_of_therapy_ever/gm3wwdk/"}
