Because it shows you\u2019re not invested in the process and instead you\u2019re trying to figure the therapist out, which is not your job. Therapy is best done when you\u2019re IN it, not trying to go around it. \n\nEquivalent would be the guy who goes to a magic show to loudly talk about out how the magician did the tricks instead of going just for the enjoyment.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lcu54p/tomorrow_is_my_first_day_of_therapy_ever/gm4jx64/"}
