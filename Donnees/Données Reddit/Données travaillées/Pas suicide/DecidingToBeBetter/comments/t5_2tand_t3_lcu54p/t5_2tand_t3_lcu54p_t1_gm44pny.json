I was terrified. I remember feeling scared just calling around for appointments. It was really nerve-wracking.\n\nI had my monthly appointment with that same therapist yesterday afternoon and guess what? I've been officially seeing her for SEVEN YEARS! Seven! She's helped me through a marriage, a divorce, many confusing years of being single, the births of my niece and nephew, multiple job changes, the loss of a 20+ year friendship, a move to another city... the list goes on and on. It has been life changing and yes, scary at times, but it's the best money I've ever spent. It's turned me into (and kept me as!) a happy, mentally healthy human who is mostly well adjusted. \n\nThe first appointment is definitely the scariest, but you will get through it. You deserve to be your best self. Good luck to you. Sending you lots of strength and love. You can do it! \ud83d\udc97", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lcu54p/tomorrow_is_my_first_day_of_therapy_ever/gm44pny/"}
