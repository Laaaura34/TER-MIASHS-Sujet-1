I could've written this a few years back. Therapy can be hard work but it's worth it. I'm proud of you for taking the leap of faith. Getting started is always the hardest part. I've been in therapy several times but am making the most progress I ever have in the last couple years. I think that's due to both maturity and finding the right person. \n\n\nFinding a therapist you click with is crucial to the process. Don't think that you have to stick with someone just because that was who you got on the first attempt. It's okay to talk to several people in an effort to find somebody that will work for you. Many therapists will do free or reduced fee consultations so you can feel each other out. If you don't know about it already, Psychology Today has a great find-a-therapist tool: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists\n\n\nOne step at a time. Vulnerability is hard. Disclose at your own pace. If somebody is pushing you harder than you're comfortable with, that's not the right therapist for you. And I want to encourage you to reframe how you look at therapy. Therapy itself isn't what fixes you. You are what fixes you (with the help of a good therapist of course). And the fact that you are here is a huge step in the right direction. \n\n\nI am proud of you. I hope you are proud of you too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lcu54p/tomorrow_is_my_first_day_of_therapy_ever/gm3b4kg/"}
