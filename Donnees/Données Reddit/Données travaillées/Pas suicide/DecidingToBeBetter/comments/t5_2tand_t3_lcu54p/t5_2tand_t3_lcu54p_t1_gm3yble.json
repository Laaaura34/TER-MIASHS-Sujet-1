You do need to find the right therapist but to your point about your experience of them not initiating, from my experience I don't think they're supposed to. The sessions can be about anything you want to talk about, if its the same stuff from the previous week then the therapist at least is aware of the background but they're there to listen first then provide understanding and tools. What you could be thinking of is someone who has the next level of psychological training where they take people on as almost a caretaker role. \n\nThats just my experience at least. My SIL is a therapist and I haven't asked her much about it but I know confidentiality is huge and her time is limited to only the window of the appointment. In her practice its common to only have a handful of clients who they see regularly, otherwise its people who are trying it for a short-term or no-showing, as people get anxious to try it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lcu54p/tomorrow_is_my_first_day_of_therapy_ever/gm3yble/"}
