I was definitely pacing around in my bathroom while ruminating. The void I felt inside, of insecurity that I thought was narcissism (the unhealthy kind,) that anxiety and guilt and shame I had been carrying around dissolved. Not completely, I think. The moment is happened I felt like my head and very core of my soul was split apart, purged, and put back together. My brain still feels like mush several days later, but it has been an intense week of reconnecting with family. I\u2019ve cried more this week than in the last 10 years combined \n\nIm still planning on putting in more emotional work for the future.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mj0sje/i_underwent_ego_death_without_even_knowing_what/gtwoy5o/"}
