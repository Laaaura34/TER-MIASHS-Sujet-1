While psychedelics can easily be mis-used, they can also be life saving. They provide perspective that many if not most people will never get to have otherwise - and that can lead to extreme, wonderful, and lasting changes in yourself and your life. \n\nYour dad's experience is valid and cautionary. But psychedelic use alone is not unsafe and will not ruin a good brain. Using them irresponsibly can and will affect you negatively, which is why we need real, actual education about how to use these properly so that those who choose to, are able to safely. Thank you for sharing, and I hope he is able to change his relationship with his emotions and overcome his depression!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mj0sje/i_underwent_ego_death_without_even_knowing_what/gt9prfs/"}
