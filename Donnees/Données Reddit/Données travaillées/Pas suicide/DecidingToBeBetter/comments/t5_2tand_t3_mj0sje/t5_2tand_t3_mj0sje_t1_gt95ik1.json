But reading more into it, I feel like it almost exactly describes my experience. I had left out some details about the actual experience, but I can definitely say that it was life-changing. Like I was disassembling everything I have ever learnt and all the things that were a part of myself, inspecting each and every piece, and rebuilding it into a new structure.
