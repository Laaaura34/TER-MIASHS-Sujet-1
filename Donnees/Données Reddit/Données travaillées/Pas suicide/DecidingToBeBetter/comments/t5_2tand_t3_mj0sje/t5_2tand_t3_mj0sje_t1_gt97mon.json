Some of the trips were mind blowing to the point that tears shed from feelings of awe, at the magnificence of the universe as one massive organism rather than trillions of separate pieces. The sensation of looking at me in the mirror (ppl say dont do it, but i was on a mission), and legitimately not being myself... being, a random entity, looking at this human in front of me.. was eye-opening. I don't think that can be explained or understood outside of psychedelics but im no expert. I've never ever felt anything like that, not before or after\n\nThere are some moments that i have awesome realizations, but personally i havent felt the full range of dissolving into a particle as a piece of one organism called the universe.. if i felt that without psychedelics id be kinda scared. Cause even on psychedelics it can be scary until i let go.. never felt that on my own, despite some really awesome realizations, but i guess everyone is different so maybe", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mj0sje/i_underwent_ego_death_without_even_knowing_what/gt97mon/"}
