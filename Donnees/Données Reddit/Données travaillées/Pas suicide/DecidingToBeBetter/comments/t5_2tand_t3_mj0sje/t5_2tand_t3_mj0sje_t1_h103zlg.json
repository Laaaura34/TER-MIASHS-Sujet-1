Depression for years and years and I feel at peace for once. I\u2019ve finally been able to cope with the death of loved ones and the stressors of daily life. Normally, I\u2019d question why you\u2019re saying this, but I truly do not care. I hope you enjoy you\u2019re life. You may be enjoying it now, but one day you\u2019ll outgrow this mindset and wonder how you were ever in it.
