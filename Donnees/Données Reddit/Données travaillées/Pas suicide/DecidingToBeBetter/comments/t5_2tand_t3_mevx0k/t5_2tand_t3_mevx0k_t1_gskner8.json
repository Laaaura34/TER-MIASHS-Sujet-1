It's exceedingly rare and so valuable to other people who are coming to terms with harm they have caused. (I work with violent youths, I know your being open about this struggle can help people!)\nI'm sorry you are having such a hard time right now. You're dealing with  a lot at the moment. \nIt's great you are taking so many steps to get better and be better. \nWhen struggling with depression and anxiety, somtimes a medical professionals can help. There is a lot of different medication to adress those things short and long term. Some people don't feel comfortable taking medication, but there is no shame in it an it can take the edge off. \nAlso there can be many medical and emotional benefits to microdosing.
