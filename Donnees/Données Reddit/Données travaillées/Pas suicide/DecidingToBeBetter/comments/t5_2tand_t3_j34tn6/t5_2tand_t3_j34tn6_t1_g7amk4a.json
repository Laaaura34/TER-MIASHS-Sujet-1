One thing I am going to tell you, because I don't want you to get discouraged when it happens:  \n\n\nWeight loss starts at portions and diet, not the gym. The gym can accelerate, but diet is the vehicle. Definitely do both, but diet is super important. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, you keep building a positive attitude. Make a plan for when it goes to will it back again. You're gonna be just fine :) IF YOU FAIL THAT'S OK. You use that same attitude to get right back on the horse and start again. The people that have done what you want to do all had periods of screwing it up. All of them. The thing is, they didn't let that be the end. That's the only difference between success and failure. Success means when you screw up, you slap yourself in the face (figuratively, unless you feel the need, I guess,) shake it off, and get back to it.  \n\n\nGo to the gym and do literally anything. Doesn't matter. You goal right now is to feel good about going, not get ripped. Associate gym = feel good in your head. You can adjust the work later. Go play basketball. Just hop on a bike for awhile and listen to music. Get in the pool/sauna for a bit. The only thing that matters is you leaving thinking \"that was nice\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g7amk4a/"}
