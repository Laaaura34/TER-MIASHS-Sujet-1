Hating yourself because of your appearance? I\u2019ve been there. A lot of us have. Body positivity is one thing, but having broken up with my girlfriend and angrily hitting the weights, combined with eating right, and realising I actually *can* change my body, I\u2019m on the side of \u201cturning self-hatred in to self-improvement\u201d.
