We all go to the gym to better ourselves, and make progress to be healthier everyday. If you keep going to the gym, that's when you will get noticed because you are one of us now, and we are always willing to help you on your journey. And we all know the beginning is super hard! So just keep at it and it will become your lifestyle too!\n\nOne thing that I learned is that exercise is important, but what you eat makes the biggest impact. I have been going to the gym for over 5 years, and actually gained weight because I thought I could continue eating pizza, hamburgers, pasta, anything I wanted. But I was wrong... I learned that I need carbs for energy, so I can't cut them out of my diet completely. Instead, I make healthier choices and just avoid overeating and don't have carbs for supper. (The part of your post about eating the mountains of food until your gut hurt - that hit home!)\n\nNow, I weigh less than I did when I started going to the gym - 63kg! So, make a plan and stick to it. You will see results pretty quick, and things will get better! \n\nYou got this!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g7bdx19/"}
