Look up BMI\u2019s shortcomings, for example. Even body fat percentage has its flaws, and it can be difficult/expensive to measure accurately.\n\nSecond, the numbers will lie to you. Weight in particular varies quite a bit just from water weight, which can be especially true for women. Also, the more fit you get, the less the numbers will change. If you\u2019re focusing too much on the numbers and using them as your bench mark, seeing the numbers slow down or being unable to see progress at all can be very demotivating, or can lead to some unhealthy and counterproductive behaviors. This is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAs others have said, it\u2019s far better to focus on making a lifestyle change and a new routine. You will look and feel better, and the other progress will follow.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g7avxxn/"}
