The hard part is deciding you want to change. Start slow and steady. Aim to lose a little bit of weight each week.\n\nDon't beat yourself up if you do miss a goal. Think of this as a long term lifestyle change. You will get there!\n\nDiet is just as important as exercise. You can eat lots of delicious foods, just try and stay away from processed foods and stuff this is high in sugar.\n\nI try and make extra food when I cook so I can freeze leftovers. Stuff like bolognese, chilli, curry, mash potato, risotto, rice, pasta sauce etc. Its easy to grab something from the freezer when you are hungry so you don't rely on takeaway or other junk food.\n\nThat being said allows yourself treats. As long as you don't eat poorly everyday there is nothing wrong with splurging a few times a week\n\nYou can do this!
