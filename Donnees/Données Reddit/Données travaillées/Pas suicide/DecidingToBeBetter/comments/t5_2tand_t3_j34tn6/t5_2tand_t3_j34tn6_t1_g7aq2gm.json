I would suggest getting a trainer if that\u2019s in your budget. They can walk you through a beginners routine, help you stay motivated and even give you help on a diet. A healthy diet, regardless of getting a trainer, is going to be the most important step. You can\u2019t outwork a bad diet. Losing weight and getting into the best shape of your life is one of the most important steps in gaining unshakable confidence. So kudos to you for taking that step. Remember that it is a journey and it takes consistency to get where you would like. \n\nIf you can\u2019t get a trainer at the moment, that\u2019s fine too, but I would suggest going to the gym with a plan. It can be very overwhelming with all the weights and machines if you don\u2019t have a plan. Take a look at Brix Fitness on YouTube, he has great advice on losing weight, and he\u2019s been through the journey first hand so he offers a lot of great advice from experience. Check out his \u201cOnly 5 exercises needed to lose weight\u201d, that\u2019s a great place to start. \n\nGood luck on your journey, and remember to love yourself regardless of how you look. Don\u2019t wait to love yourself until you\u2019re at your goal weight. You got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g7aq2gm/"}
