And want to tell the bully that was you who was also putting yourself down everyday to get lost! However, these old habits and ways of being hang around and so don\u2019t get disheartened if you find you have a bad day- just pick yourself up and remember each day is a new chance to practice being the new version of you. Sometimes we feel when we stop being our old negative low self esteem version that the new version is also just being another person to say we are unworthy. So just practice so much self compassion!\nAnd remember you don\u2019t drown because you fell in the water- you drown because you stay there/ so if you have a bad day - jump out of the water, dry off and start again!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g7c5ctd/"}
