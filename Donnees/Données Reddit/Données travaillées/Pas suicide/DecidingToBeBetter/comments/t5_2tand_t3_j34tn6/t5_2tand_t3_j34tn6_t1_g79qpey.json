Don\u2019t worry about what other people are doing at the gym, they\u2019re only focused on themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s good to have a bit of a training plan (check out Reddit/fitness) but for the first few sessions just get in, lift some weights and enjoy the pump.\n\nIt\u2019s a gradual process but training won\u2019t just help you look better, youll feel it as well - like you\u2019ve mentioned.\n\nWhen we feel better about ourselves it shows externally. Hold yourself with more pride etc. \n\nSmash it out brother and good luck on the journey", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g79qpey/"}
