I want to emphasise just how important this step is for you. Recognising an issue is difficult in and of itself and especially when it's in a sensitive area of life like our self worth. So for you to recognise that you want to start loving yourself is fucking huge and you deserve props for that. Then making steps to become the person you want to be is even bigger. \n\nDon't worry about what you look like in the gym or even what you do in the gym for the first couple of months! Just find stuff you like doing and fucking do it man! \n\nI'm proud of you bro. \n\nPM me if you need any guidance in the gym, I'd be more than happy to give you hand.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g7bjdy8/"}
