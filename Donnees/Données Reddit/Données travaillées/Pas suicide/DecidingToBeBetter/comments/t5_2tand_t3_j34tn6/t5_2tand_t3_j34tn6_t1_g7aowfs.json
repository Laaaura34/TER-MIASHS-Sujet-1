If you are sore from the gym try some yoga on youtube when u get home!! 5 parks yoga is my fave theres lots of beginner or short classes. I find yoga helped me soo much with depression/anxiety/mindset stuff. And doing it privately is so relaxing. Fresh air and walking too!!! Any chance you are in the position to adopt a dog? Mine made me way healthier by getting me out every day. Also self-love meditations on youtube to rewire your subconscious mind. Sounds silly but theres science behind it!! Good luck!
