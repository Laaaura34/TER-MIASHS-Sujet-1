Those being 1) not being too inwardly focused, and 2) envisioning myself as a movie character (or how said it: seeing yourself from 3rd person).  \n\nMy #2 here has really lead me to become less afraid of conversation, which in turn gave me the confidence to just respond in a manner that more closely resembles my personality. It used to be that as soon as someone started talking to me, I would just want it to end..even when that someone was one of my mates.  Furthermore, you dont ever see people in tv shows or movies act shy/anxious/unconfident...they don't touch their face or do normal anxiety body language things...theyre just a person, they just *are.*\n\nGreat write up, man.
