Totally agree. \n\nThe thing with motivation is - nobody WANTS to do homework. You\u2019re not weird or broken for not wanting to. It\u2019s just the thing you have to do to pass the class and get the degree. \n\nSelf Discipline is doing it even though you don\u2019t want to, because you know it\u2019s necessary for your long term happiness.
