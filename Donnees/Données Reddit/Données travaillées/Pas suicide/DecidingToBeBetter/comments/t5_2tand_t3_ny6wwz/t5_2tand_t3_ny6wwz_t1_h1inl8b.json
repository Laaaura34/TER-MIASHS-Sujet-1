It really sounds like you just need to take care of yourself & your needs. I think TV might just be a good escapism method for you right now. Make sure all your basic needs are being taken care of. Look into mindfulness & develop your ability to focus with intention. Live off a sharp routine. Create a list of numbers in your notes, set short goals each month & tick off each day you do well/are on path to your goals. Use rewards to motivate yourself & try to replace bad habits with good ones. You watch a lot of TV? What about documentaries or podcasts instead? With University, sometimes reconnecting with purpose is what you need. Why are you studying? To get a degree, to help people, to provide for yourself & your family? There needs to be some meaning behind the madness. Good luck & with a little optimism - I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine, all the best to you & your family. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ny6wwz/i_could_use_some_advice/h1inl8b/"}
