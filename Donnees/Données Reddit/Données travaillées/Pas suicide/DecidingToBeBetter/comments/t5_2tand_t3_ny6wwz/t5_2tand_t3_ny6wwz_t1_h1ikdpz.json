Sometimes you need self discipline more than motivation. Some ppl make a deal, they\u2019ll get dressed to workout and once dressed decide if they want to do it. They\u2019ll get ready for a project and decide if they want to do the project after getting ready, or after five minutes of doing the project. Make yourself those deals. Get ready, get started, and a few minutes in decide if you want to continue. The answer will often be yes. May as well finish, is sometimes what I think when debating quitting a project or task. \n\nDistractions arent inherently bad either. But we allow them to take over too much. Try the Pomodoro technique. Mytomatoes.com or many other apps and websites could help with that. Tackle some small things to help \u201cget motivated\u201d and be able to have accomplished something. You\u2019ll seek out that feeling more. Again though, sometimes you just have to jump in and do it because motivation isnt always going to work. It just helps along the way sometimes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ny6wwz/i_could_use_some_advice/h1ikdpz/"}
