They're not one in the same. NPD is a disorder - hence why I have sat in on sessions with someone who has it. Narcissism is not a disorder and it s personality quality anyone can have. Seriously, you could google this stuff.\n\n \n\n>People will do alot of bad and still perceive themselfs as good and will do anything to make sure people see them as good even if it's bad.\n\nAnd it's not healthy by which I means it harms other people. It being commonly occurring doesn't meant that it's excusable. Plenty of harmful things are common, doesn't make that okay. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain - don't assume. I have autism, ADHD, and OCD. I also stated that I live with another mentally ill person. We have mentally ill family members. I don't know how you thought that was going to change my perspective? Again, it being common doesn't excuse harm. \n\nHaving mental illness doesn't make your harmful actions justifiable. It just means you're a mentally ill person who's also harmful to other people. Most people with mental illness aren't terribly harmful to other people. \n\nNot taking responsibility and using a comparably minor action to deflect criticism from her a more impactful choice she made is not okay. Threating to never speak to a person again over is incredibly extreme. She needs to balance what she needs with what's fair and reasonable to her friend. \n\nEveryone wants to be treated fairly and with empathy. That takes precedent over \"looking good\" in my book at least.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qckla8/i_think_i_successfully_prevented_a_conflict_from/hht6wua/"}
