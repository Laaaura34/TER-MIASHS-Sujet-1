It's not about doing MORE, it's about doing things CONSISTENTLY. So how do you become more disciplined? Stay disciplined. \n\nAvoid the trap of thinking that the only way to create change is to keep adding things, and give yourself time to adjust and let these changes become fully integrated into your life.
