I often hear bullshit about \"power of will\" but it doesn't work like this and people say \"fuck it\" and come back to same behavior.\n\nIf it work for me, it doesn't mean it is for everyone.

Then when life without smoking become normal, try to change something else.\n\nHope I'm not sound like a cheap motivational speaker =)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppv2b8/150_days_small_story_of_a_person_who_wants_to/hd7s6nq/"}
