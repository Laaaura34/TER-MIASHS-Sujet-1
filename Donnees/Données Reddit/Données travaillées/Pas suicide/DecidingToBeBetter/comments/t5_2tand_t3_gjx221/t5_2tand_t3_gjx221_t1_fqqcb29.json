Yes! Yes! That\u2019s awesome! Dude there\u2019s a Tibetan Lama that does daily 7am (Central Time) Namch\u00f6 practice over Zoom call and daily 6pm (Central Time) Rigdzin Dupa evening practice over Zoom call. It is so fantastic; the English phonetic spellings and literal English translations as well as Tibetan text is on the screen so you can follow along. To get the Zoom meeting ID, subscribe to Palri Od Ling\u2019s email newsletter through their website. Or PM me your email and I can forward it to you!\n\nAlso,  Yoga Nidra\u2019s fascinating, it has helped me reach my deepest meditations. I would love to hear what you think of it if you try it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gjx221/after_attempting_suicide_at_15_losing_100_pounds/fqqcb29/"}
