Ice packs are what got me to start going back outside little bits at a time, I'd carry 2 in a lunch box and take them out and hold them when I started feeling the panic rising. The cold helps! I don't need them outside anymore, but I still use them when I'm inside. Distraction is another goodie that I use daily! This one is weird, but talking out loud about why I'm anxious helps a bit too (like, \"I am freaking out because I touched broken glass and now I think some is still on my hands even after I wash them.\"). \n\nThese are for my anxiety and panic, my OCD coping is still a work in progress haha.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i4garm/im_a_31_year_old_mom_of_2_and_i_just_passed_the/g0j6m2w/"}
