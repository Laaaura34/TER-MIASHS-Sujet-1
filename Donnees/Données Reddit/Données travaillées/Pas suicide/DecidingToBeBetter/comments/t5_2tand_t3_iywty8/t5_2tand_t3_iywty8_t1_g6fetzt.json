I can comment on the second reason. I too have noticed a lack of quality content. I don\u2019t spend much time in those subs anymore because it\u2019s always the same thing. People copying others. I have a business and for that business we have to write content. It\u2019s a lot of work to make high quality content. Tons of research goes into it tracking keywords, competitor analysis, etc. just for the preparation of any content piece. I wouldn\u2019t expect the average reddit user to go through this process before posting. I certainly don\u2019t. Most people don\u2019t know how to do it or don\u2019t want to.
