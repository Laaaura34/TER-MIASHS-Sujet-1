For example, if I hadn\u2019t stayed with my asshole ex-husband as long as I did I wouldn\u2019t know the people I know now, live in the house that I do, have the job that I have, etc. I love those people dearly and love where I am right now. I know that\u2019s a weird thing to mention, it\u2019s just the way that I let myself off the hook for things I regret.\n\nAlso, once I figured out that life is a series of decisions you make and every decision you make every day leads you on a path. Another example, I once went to a lecture about historic houses in my city at a local library. It was a spur of the moment decision. After the lecture I went to ask the lecturer (who ran the local historic preservation society) if I could see more photos from their collection. I went in later that week and she asked me if I wanted to volunteer there. That led to a job, which led me to end up going to grad school for museum studies, which led me to a long career working in museums. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that moving forward if you remind yourself that every little decision you make can change your life. For me it helped get those bad intrusive thoughts out of my head. I don\u2019t know if this helps, but as a middle aged woman, that\u2019s the knowledge I\u2019ve gained. I spent way too much time thinking I\u2019m a horrible person and focusing on the decisions I make helped me realize I\u2019m not.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h7bpqh/learning_how_to_not_hate_myself_and_forgiving/fulknps/"}
