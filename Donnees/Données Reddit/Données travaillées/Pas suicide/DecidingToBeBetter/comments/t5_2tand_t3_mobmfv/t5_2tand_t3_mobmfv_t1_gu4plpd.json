For a while. You don't cut them off your life completely, but for the meantime you pursue your own growth. Early 20s is still phase where you find yourself, so it's highly likely that they'll change in the coming years, too.\nI'm in my mid-20s and I'm very different from who I was back when I'm 23.

Live. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mobmfv/is_it_appropriate_to_separate_myself_23_from/gu4plpd/"}
