But this is so brave of you to decide to do so :)\n\nYou certainly have to let go of the vision of you being \"perfect\" because perfection doesn't exist. I'm telling you this because when you start this journey, it is a tiring journey. And on days when you feel tired, you start blaming yourself because you didn't do enough. You should then remember that you did enough on that day. You should understand that taking a break is fine once in a while too. \n\nI recommend using a habit tracker to know the things you want to do. And also, you will not be able to do everything you set your mind to at first. So everything takes times. \n\nGood luck on your journey. I hope you update frequently. And if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here  :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o75k9s/i_want_to_be_better/h2xyymf/"}
