You do seem to have a very good heart with better intentions. In life sometimes it takes difficult trials and tribulations to show you what really matters. For you, its gramma and her knowing that you're happy n healthy will help her. That being said, also keep in mind that she has her own struggles/demons/shadows, so even if you become the greatest grandkid ever, she will still have her own struggles you can't fix.
