Revisit this.\n\nKeep the mindset of getting better and revisit it. You may see days that appeared burned out or tiring. That is life. \n\nWhat anchors you, choosing to overcome, and being open to changes will make the difference.\n\nI lost my mom 2 years ago and have been applying the mindset: I will love unconditionally all people regardless of my bias or dislike. To walk with my head held up and bring others along the way. The way mom taught me.\n\nI am apologize if I made this about me. However, I want to relay a way of how to use the emotions and mindset obtained to project yourself forward. I had a hard time learning this on my own when she died. It wasn\u2019t till a year later did I learn how to channel into the right mindset without falling to tears.\n\nAs human reaching out to another human:\n\nYou can. \nYou will. \nYou must overcome.\n\nDo it for you and those that inspire you.\n\nWith love and to your success!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o75k9s/i_want_to_be_better/h34lxxi/"}
