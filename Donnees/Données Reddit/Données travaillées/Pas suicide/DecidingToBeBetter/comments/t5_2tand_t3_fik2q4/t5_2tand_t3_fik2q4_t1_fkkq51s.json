I  once got 5years sober but because I thought I could just live like  everybody else in time I started using again. be careful. nothing wrong  with Dj-ing but if you have addiction problems then you have nothing to  do with going to bars. \n\nI understand what you're getting at. Thank you for the concern. The party where I was DJ'ing, wasn't your usual party. It was a lindy-hop social dance. Here people come to dance firstly, socialize secondly, and drinking is just a fringe activity. The incidence of drunk people is very low. Can't say that I've seen anyone overly drunk at these events in the 5 years since I started Lindy Hop.\n\nWhat you're saying is true with regards to 'normal' nightlife. I went to a normal party some weeks ago. As not everyone was able to leave at the same time, we gathered at a friends place. I felt uneasy then, after some reflection I found out that it reminded me to much of predrinking, which I enjoyed in the past. To prevent any risk or unease, I'm going to tell them that I'll go to the party independently and we could join up later.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fik2q4/three_sober_years_sober_life_is_sublime/fkkq51s/"}
