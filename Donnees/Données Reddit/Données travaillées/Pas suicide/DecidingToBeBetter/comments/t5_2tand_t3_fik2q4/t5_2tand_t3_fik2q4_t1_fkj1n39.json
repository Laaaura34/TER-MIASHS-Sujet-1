And keep on going! \n\nit feels so good to finally have some control over my life! being sober is the absolute best! Good thing about all those years using is how i thankful I am for my life today! things other people find boring, I find awesome! I'm just so happy I'm a part of a regular life finally! \n\ngood luck to you! And keep following up on about this disease! there are so much scientist have discovered these past years :)\n\nAlso sorry if I am out of line, but it's not a good idea to go to bars, not even if you've been sober for years, because that can turn on those signals in your brain that call out for you to use. always be careful.. I once got 5years sober but because I thought I could just live like everybody else in time I started using again. be careful. nothing wrong with Dj-ing but if you have addiction problems then you have nothing to do with going to bars.\n\nbut good luck to you and hope you stay well \n\nSorry for spelling, and if my wording is wrong or if I sound weird, English isn't my first language", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fik2q4/three_sober_years_sober_life_is_sublime/fkj1n39/"}
