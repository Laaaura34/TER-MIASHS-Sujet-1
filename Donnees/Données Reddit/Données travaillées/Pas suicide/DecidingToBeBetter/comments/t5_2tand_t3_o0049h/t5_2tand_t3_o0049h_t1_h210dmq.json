I appreciate it!\n\nIt's funny you bring up writing, I was having this same conversation with a friend who is a screenwriting major and he told me this quote from Akira Kurosawa that really stuck with me in the past week.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-McmgQbee0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-McmgQbee0)\n\nIt starts around 4:25, but basically it says that writing is like climbing a mountain. If you keep looking at the peak, you'll get frustrated. You just gotta keep putting one foot in front of the other and focus on where you are now.
