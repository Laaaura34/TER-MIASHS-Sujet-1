It didn't work unfortunately. My search in finding a cheap phone may have been TOO cheap lol. I ordered a Nokia 225 instead and the cheapie is on its way to be returned. I'll give an update on that one.\n\nIn regards to getting a dumbie that works with your current carrier, I know that some carriers will sell specific phones that will work with their carrier without a problem. For example, T-Mobile has Alcatel and I believe Verizon has some cool Nokia phones. I have T-mobile and for now I'm going to try other \"unlocked\" options just because I hear bad things about Alcatel flip phones. If none work, I'll just go for the Alcaltel. As long as it can call and text then that's all I could ask for!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0049h/ordered_a_19_dumb_phone_on_amazon_arriving/h20zg0b/"}
