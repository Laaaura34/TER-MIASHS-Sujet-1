I'll definitely check that out. When I went without social media for 6 months earlier, what pulled the trigger for me was watching the Social Dilemma. It made me feel so gross to know that I was just a \"product\" of something masquerading as a tool when really it's the embodiment of unethical corporate greed designed to be as addictive as humanly possible. The fact that now they're coming out with 30 second clips with endless scrolling - constant blast of \"content\" - means that it's not getting any better. It takes a person a few minutes to make an \"insightful\" post about something they just learned this morning that they don't really have a deep understanding of. And that to me is shallow and a waste of time.\n\nAnd even knowing all this, I can spend 3-5 hours on Instagram alone a day.\n\nRight now I'll admit that my brain is wired for short-term rewards, but I'm hoping this change will be the first step towards more deep work and mindfulness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0049h/ordered_a_19_dumb_phone_on_amazon_arriving/h211b3n/"}
