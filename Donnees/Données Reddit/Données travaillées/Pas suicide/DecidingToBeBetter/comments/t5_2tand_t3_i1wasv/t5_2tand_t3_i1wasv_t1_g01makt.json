You would be able to receive the support needed as you learn to develop your own. Therapy offers a way to reach your goals without judgment or criticism, while at the same time being able to receive compassion and validation, which could help unlearn the ideas you've internalized when you were younger. I'm sorry your sense of self was affected at an early age that keeps you from being able to understand and accept what it is that you deserve, because everyone told you otherwise. \n\nRegardless of going to therapy or not, making these changes is not easy work, it takes time, and you have to want to learn what you can overcome. If you're terrified for thinking the way you've been thinking for so long and you think it's limiting you from doing the things you want, what do you have to lose to try no matter how big or small the goal is? There is no perfect, correct, or balanced way to do things sometimes, because sometimes you just have to do it no matter how scary it is.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i1wasv/i_think_ive_become_afraid_of_feeling_good_about/g01makt/"}
