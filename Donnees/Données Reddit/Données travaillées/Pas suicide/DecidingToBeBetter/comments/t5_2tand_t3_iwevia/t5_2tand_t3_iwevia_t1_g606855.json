All the gains (wealth, things, people, love etc) in life are the extras, the luxury. Life is about loss and the growth from the loss. The luxuries come and go but growth stays with you. \n\nWhen you live in the moment, and later look back on those moments... It's as if you were living a dream. A good dream. Think of all the best moments where you took a chance and went for it. They're like dreams now that you can look back. \n\nAll the plans you've executed in the past... If you look back, they're the mundane moments where you worked toward a goal. They weren't as much as a dream as they were \"work\". \n\nYou grew from both. So... Dream a Little, work a little.
