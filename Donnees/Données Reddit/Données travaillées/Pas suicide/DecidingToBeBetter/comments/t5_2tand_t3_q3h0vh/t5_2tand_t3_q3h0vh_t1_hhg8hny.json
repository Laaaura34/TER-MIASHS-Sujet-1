I work for TS and wanted to mention that if you end up switching to a new therapist on the platform, you have the option to share your previous messages with the new therapist. I\u2019ve found that helpful because I get an idea of what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s happened so far in sessions. It would be up to you if you feel comfortable with that but I wanted to put it out there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3h0vh/my_therapist_is_breaking_up_with_me/hhg8hny/"}
