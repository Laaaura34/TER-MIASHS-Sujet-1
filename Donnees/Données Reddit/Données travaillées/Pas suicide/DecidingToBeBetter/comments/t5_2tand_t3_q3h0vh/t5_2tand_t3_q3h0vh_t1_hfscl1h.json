I was very close to see the \"end\" of my sessions with him but I never had the chance to hear him say it.\n\nIt's been a few years now and I still think about him and feel that my journey was incomplete. \n\nI look at new therapists here and there but I also think about how it would feel to start from scratch and having to find the right one, mine was a long journey which changed me a lot. \n\nHope the best for you, maybe at some point I will also try someone new.
