I unfortunately had a similar experience at Calmerry after three months of almost daily sessions. All of a sudden, my therapist was not working with Calmerry anymore. No explanations... they suggested a new therapist. I refused.\n\nIn the mean time, I went to one consultation IRL with a therapist who practices about 40 min. from my place and who also did follow-up consultations online via Whereby. Maybe you can find someone like that not too far from you?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3h0vh/my_therapist_is_breaking_up_with_me/hfrot3l/"}
