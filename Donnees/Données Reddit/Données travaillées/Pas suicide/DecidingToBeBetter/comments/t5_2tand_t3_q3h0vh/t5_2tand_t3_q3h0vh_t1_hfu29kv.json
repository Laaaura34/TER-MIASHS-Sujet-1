I saw my first therapist at 12, who told me in like the first ten minutes that a close friend of mine was going to hell for being a lesbian (and I was waaaay into the closet denying that I liked girls while everyone else our age seemed to be discovering boys)\n\nHave you tried using psychologytoday's therapist finder? I live in the south too, and I had much better luck finding a in person therapist this way. You can specifically filter by stuff like religion and LGBT which were my two big worries down here.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3h0vh/my_therapist_is_breaking_up_with_me/hfu29kv/"}
