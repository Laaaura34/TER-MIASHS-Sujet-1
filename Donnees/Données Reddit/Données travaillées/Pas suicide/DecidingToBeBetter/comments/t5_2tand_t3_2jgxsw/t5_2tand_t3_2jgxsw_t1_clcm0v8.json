I have done MASSIVE amounts of research and a ketogenic diet is pretty solid. But just with any other diet there cant only be one way to successfully use it, plus most \"diet\" subs either push the idea of \"dieting\" or \"lifestyle.\" Lifestyle subs tend to be MUCH more strict in their thinking.\n\nI did keto three year, up till 4 weeks ago when I switched slowly back to a more typical midline cutting/lifting eating schedule. I just didn't feel like keto was doing anything for me anymore. I havent felt better in a long time. Change can be good sometime.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2jgxsw/i_decided_to_be_better_by_unsubbing_from_many/clcm0v8/"}
