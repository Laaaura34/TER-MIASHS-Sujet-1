None of those may be things you're interested in, but just using the search function for a hobby you're into can yield some interesting and delightfully specific subs, in my experience! Adding mine to the voices recommending /r/futurology, too, and /r/askhistorians is fantastically moderated so as to foster in-depth and good-faith discussion.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2jgxsw/i_decided_to_be_better_by_unsubbing_from_many/clcbccw/"}
