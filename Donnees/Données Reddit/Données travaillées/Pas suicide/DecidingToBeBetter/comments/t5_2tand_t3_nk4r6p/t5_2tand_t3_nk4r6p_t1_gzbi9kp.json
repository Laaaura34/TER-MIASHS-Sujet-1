But even still, The first two weeks I was back in the gym, I panicked the whole way there, was self conscious the whole time I was inside and would cry the entire way home. It was like a mix between dissatisfaction w my body and disappointment in myself for letting what was supposed to be a little break, turn into something out of control. But then I just kept telling myself that I should remember these feelings and when I want to stop, think about myself crying all the way home lol.\n\nI have always been the type of person that adheres to my limits. When I\u2019ve had enough I\u2019ve fucking have had enough and the only way out I see, is through. I know that may not be helpful for you but for me that\u2019s where my push and drive comes from.\n\nI have bipolar type 1 disorder and so I know how it feels to be low, LOW. I also know what it takes to combat those mood swings. Diet, exercise, routine, steady sleep, etc\n\nI want to feel good, I enjoy being confident in myself, I enjoy being happy and putting in the work just feels worth it at a certain point. I\u2019ve fallen off before and I\u2019ll fall off again probably bc that\u2019s just the nature of my disorder but you know as long as you get back up and keep trying, who cares. \n\nStart where you\u2019re comfortable. 15 minutes a day even to start is something!\n\nYou can do it!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nk4r6p/i_posted_on_here_a_couple_months_ago_about_going/gzbi9kp/"}
