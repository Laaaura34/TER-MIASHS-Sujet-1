Are there tons of health and diet tips online? I just try to pick one and incorporate that into my life. Diet tip: Carbs aren't very good for you in large quantities, you wanna keep carbs down\n\nThere are situations where that's not true, and there are certainly other diet tips that'll also help quite a bit as well. But I decided cutting down on carbs was important, so I just focused on that. Now I don't have any bread-based meals, the most bread I have in a day might be a tortilla wrap (for a burrito) or a single sandwich. But no crackers or chips, bagels, toast, croissants, anything like that. It's been pretty successful, and more importantly, it makes me feel like I'm making progress without over complicating things.\n\nIf the strategy you chose isn't working for you, you pick a different one to follow. But don't worry about whether the strategy you choose is the *best* one objectively, only worry about whether or not it'll help you right now. Because any helpful action you choose will always be better than being indecisive and doing nothing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjr8zy/overthinking_is_ruining_my_life/gtc322n/"}
