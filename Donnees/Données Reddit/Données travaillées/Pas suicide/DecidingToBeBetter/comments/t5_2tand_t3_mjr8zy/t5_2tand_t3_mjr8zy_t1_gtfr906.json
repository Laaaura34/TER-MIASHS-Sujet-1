Your brain is in fact still developing, and I don\u2019t mean that in a condescending way; it\u2019s just biologically going to be harder for you to feel settled. A lot of this will improve with time. It\u2019s important to carve out time for meditation and reflection and therapy when you\u2019re trying to change your thoughts patterns. Try meditating for one minute a day for even just a week. Or try repeating to yourself \u201cI will be okay\u201d as a positive mantra when you\u2019re overthinking. A lot of the path to being better is just telling yourself things are going to be okay.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjr8zy/overthinking_is_ruining_my_life/gtfr906/"}
