It sounds like you might try and do too many things at once or do something to the max, become successful for a while and then *burn out* as your question implies. \nHere\u2019s what I suggest:\n- try to set SMART goals (that way you won\u2019t burn out by pursuing unrealistic goals and doing them to the max) \n- log your goals them by adding them on the Productive app. The Productive app helps you maintain streaks so your only goal is to not break them.\n- pay attention to how to feel when you\u2019re pursuing your goals. Question how does this make me feel? Is this really important to me? Do I need to do this? \n- If the responses to the above questions are negative, stop doing that goal and focus on more important things. Pursuing 5 important things and really succeeding is way more useful than pursuing 100 less meaningless things and not getting very far with any of them. You\u2019re only human. Don\u2019t let some arrogant CEO convince you otherwise. \n- How do you view yourself as a person? Do you think you need to fight through and blame yourself when you don\u2019t? If so, you might have to be more forgiving towards yourself which sounds soppy but when you accept yourself, you accept the limits of what you can do and actually get MORE shit done.
