I moved to Florida to be closer to family, but once I moved there they moved to Colorado. The jobs pay horribly, and for whatever reason Florida is the angriest place I\u2019ve ever lived. I actually went and got my concealed carry permit because of it. I decided to go back to school to become a behavioral analyst, so I got accepted to Arizona State, so I moved to Arizona after three years in Florida. \n\nYou have every right to be nervous. My first couple of months here were rough; I had trouble finding a place to live, finding a job in my field, and my car got repossessed. I rebounded, though; I decided to transfer over my teaching license, and now I work as an elementary special education teacher and I\u2019m in a relationship with an amazing person.\n\nI hope you find happiness and success in your new venture", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4uq1z/i_did_it_im_finally_leaving_florida/hg4b9t4/"}
