I know I try hard to create my own little world and do the things that I love which means the ocean and my pool. I feel for you friend and am glad you\u2019re able to get outta here. I\u2019ve lived in Japan, Italy, Spain, Iceland, Guam and seen all points in between. Most people I meet have never left their county let alone seen the world, but I found that to be the case in many places we\u2019ve lived in America. I love traveling and meeting new people. I wish you well on your hunt for a new adventure and hope your parents stay well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4uq1z/i_did_it_im_finally_leaving_florida/hg36e7b/"}
