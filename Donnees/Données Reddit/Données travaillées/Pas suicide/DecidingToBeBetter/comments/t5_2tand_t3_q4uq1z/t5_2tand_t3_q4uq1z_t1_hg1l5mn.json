I don't know what city you're moving to, but I hope your days are filled with good beer and amazing hiking.\n\nI'm in a similar spot, I decided to help out my parents and move back to my home state. Moved from a popular international city, working alongside very academically smart people to redneck country, surrounded by people who love trucks and guns. Super depressed because it feels like I'm wasting my best years. So glad you got out, you give me hope. Best of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4uq1z/i_did_it_im_finally_leaving_florida/hg1l5mn/"}
