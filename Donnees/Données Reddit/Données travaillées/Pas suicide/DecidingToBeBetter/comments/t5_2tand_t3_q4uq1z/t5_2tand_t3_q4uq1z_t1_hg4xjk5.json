That said\u2026.let the people who buy into the \u201cFlorida Man\u201d stories talk. I very rarely correct people or talk about all of the positive things about Florida because although I know my measly 2 cents won\u2019t make a difference or change anyone\u2019s mind to either side\u2026.keep in mind that we\u2019re one of the fastest growing states right now. If this continues or increases, we\u2019re looking at the cost of living going through the roof. So if you don\u2019t want us to become the next California or Nevada, my advice is to not correct folks who see Florida as the shit stain of the country\u2026hell even encourage them. I see no problem with less people wanting to move here. More Florida for us.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4uq1z/i_did_it_im_finally_leaving_florida/hg4xjk5/"}
