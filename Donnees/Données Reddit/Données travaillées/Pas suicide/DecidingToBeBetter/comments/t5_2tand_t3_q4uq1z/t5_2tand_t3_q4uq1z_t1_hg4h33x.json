I\u2019ve been to some pretty awesome places on Florida, and also seen the bad parts. Conversely, I\u2019ve been through California and seen the bad parts and the cost to live there. It\u2019s a give and take. Colorado is awesome and I think it\u2019s got a lot to offer. That said, the cost of living there is starting to get up there with California and eventually I see it falling to the same demise as California. The dream would be a remote job and live in Montana or Utah. \n\nI hope you find peace in Colorado and your life/attitude flourishes. Try and see the good in a situation, make a conscious effort to create a list of the positives when you\u2019re feeling down and it will help elevate you a bit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4uq1z/i_did_it_im_finally_leaving_florida/hg4h33x/"}
