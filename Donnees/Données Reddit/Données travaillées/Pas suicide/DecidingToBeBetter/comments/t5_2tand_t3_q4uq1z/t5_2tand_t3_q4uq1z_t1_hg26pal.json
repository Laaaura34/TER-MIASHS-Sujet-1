If all states had similar laws, it wouldn\u2019t be exclusive to Florida.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Florida is awful and I wish I could leave, but it\u2019s a misconception that Florida has more crazy people than anywhere else.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4uq1z/i_did_it_im_finally_leaving_florida/hg26pal/"}
