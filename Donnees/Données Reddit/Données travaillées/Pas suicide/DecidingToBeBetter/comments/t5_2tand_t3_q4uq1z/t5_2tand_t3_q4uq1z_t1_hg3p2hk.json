I\u2019m in a similar situation where I want to leave Florida. I\u2019ve lived here for 29 years and feel isolated, stagnant and out of place. Professionally I\u2019ve become better but social life is damn near nonexistent. A lot of my friends left the state and the ones who stayed feel more distant than ever. I\u2019ve been working to move to a better state but I\u2019m not sure where to yet. Accounting for housing, work and environment in a area is a top priority. \n\nFrom your post and from many of the comments I can see that not everyone has the same experience down here in Florida as do others in different states, but there\u2019s no denying that feeling to be in a better place for yourself. I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re making this move.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4uq1z/i_did_it_im_finally_leaving_florida/hg3p2hk/"}
