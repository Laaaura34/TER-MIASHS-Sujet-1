There are two americas unfortunately. Both jokingly poke fun or Florida but I\u2019ve noticed the political right has been moving here in droves while more moderate or even progressive people will get sick of the governors rhetoric and laws. Also Florida, like Texas, is a tax haven amongst high population states. \n\nSo all of this creates two realities, both pretty true. \nYes, Florida is an inexpensive and sunny spot to move a family to with a lot of thriving businesses. \nBut also, these business have underpaying jobs, and the cultural/moral standards set by DeSantis can be a bit insufferable. Hope I didn\u2019t sound like an annoying political centrist or anything it\u2019s just that Florida is home and people always ask about this contradiction.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4uq1z/i_did_it_im_finally_leaving_florida/hg36220/"}
