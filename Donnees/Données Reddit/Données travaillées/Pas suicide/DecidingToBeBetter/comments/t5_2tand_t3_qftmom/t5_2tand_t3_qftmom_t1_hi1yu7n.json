Some people like that I cuss and it relaxes them and they can be more of themselves and you get better dialog when people are relaxed. Some folks just don\u2019t cuss and don\u2019t appreciate it and you can spot them real quick after a while. In those situations I apologize and play it off like a slip. I do try to mix it up a bit, just say \u201cf\u2019in\u201d or \u201cfreakin\u201d or \u201cflippin\u201d, things like \u201cshut the front door\u201d, shit becomes crap, bullshit is just bs. We are all grown ups, we can have purple hair and tattoo sleeves, I don\u2019t think cussing is that big of a deal, but depending on the read of the room, I turn it down a bit or switch words. Typically my realness and honesty has made me a preferred person to talk to in business and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever kept me from doing something.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qftmom/how_to_stop_swearing_constantly/hi1yu7n/"}
