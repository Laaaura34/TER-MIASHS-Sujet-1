I don\u2019t know your situation so I\u2019m not sure if this helps but I started remembering my hobbies while coming up with a random list of activites I wanted to do before (which only took a few minutes btw). And then I just chose the most convenient one to do. People like you are the real gems of the world, persisting through adversity. So I urge you to also take the time to take care of yourself.
