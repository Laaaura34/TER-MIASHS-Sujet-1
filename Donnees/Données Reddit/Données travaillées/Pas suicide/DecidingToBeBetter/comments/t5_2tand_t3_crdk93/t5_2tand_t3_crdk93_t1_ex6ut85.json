I live in a big city so I have opportunities but a lot of them is only enjoyable if you have a partner... I feel like movies, taking walks and sitting in cafes are my only reasonable options. My friends live far away so I can rarely see them, and I used to go out with my ex all the time, it's weird doing it alone and not fulfilling. Before the relationship I was single for almost a year and I learnt to enjoy it but now it hurts again... I wish I could bounce back to that happy time, before I met my ex and started dating.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/crdk93/i_took_myself_on_a_date_last_night/ex6ut85/"}
