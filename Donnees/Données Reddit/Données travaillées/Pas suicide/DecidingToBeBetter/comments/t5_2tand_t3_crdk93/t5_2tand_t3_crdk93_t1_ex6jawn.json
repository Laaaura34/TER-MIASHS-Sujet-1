Enjoying your own company is very powerful, and something no one can take from you. After my first big breakup (also both of our first real relationship ) I did what you\u2019re doing: learned to truly enjoy being alone. I went out for drinks by myself, I took myself out for dinner, even a little travel solo. I just lived exactly how I wished. And once I started dating again it was much easier because I wasn\u2019t afraid of being along. These guys had to compete with *me* for my attention; I didn\u2019t need them so much as I chose to spend my time with them. In doing so I found someone who respects my independence and compliments it, rather than trying to change me. \n\nEnjoy, the world is wide open for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/crdk93/i_took_myself_on_a_date_last_night/ex6jawn/"}
