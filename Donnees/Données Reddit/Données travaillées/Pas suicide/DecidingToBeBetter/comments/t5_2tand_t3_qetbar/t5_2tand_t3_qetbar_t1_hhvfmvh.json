I went through similar at uni and my department was really supportive when I found the right people to talk to about this. Contact your department, have a meeting with them to tell what\u2019s going on. Figure out some solutions that will work for you, for me I got permission to delay some of my exams to take in the summer, they referred me to doctor and to academic support department at the student union (then I learned I was dyslexic as well as depressed) and everything started to improve.\n\nIn the chance that the first person you contact is not offering good solutions or is not supportive in a way you need keep trying. There will be people in your department who can help. This happens. Your college wants you to succeed and it\u2019s not an easy time for everyone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qetbar/college_is_killing_me_and_idk_what_to_do/hhvfmvh/"}
