I hope you can find a counselor or advisor to speak with both about your academic issue and about your mental health. It\u2019s good you recognize your issues and that you posted.

I\u2019m sorry you are suffering\u2026but this suffering is within your control to change what you are willing and able to change. College is not a time to suffer, it\u2019s a time to discover yourself, learn and grow.
