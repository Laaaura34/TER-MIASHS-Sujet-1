For being so young you definitely seem like you have a good head on your shoulders and that you take action. Those 2 traits plus resiliency and kindness will get you far in this world and certainly can get you out of this hole before falling further. Kudos to you. I was not as wise in my youth so I self medicated for years rather than deal with my issues. Proud of you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qetbar/college_is_killing_me_and_idk_what_to_do/hhvgzt4/"}
