And maybe reconsider your major if you are not passionate about the content of your courses. Although typically the first 2 years I had to take basic fundamentals and they were boring but to get to year 3 and beyond I had no choice.\nAs for friends\u2026 my thinking is find a group to join where YOU can \u201cbe the friend\u201d. When we help others we find amazing things about ourselves our vibration rises and we start to attract different people. Also: if you say \u201ccollege is killing me\u201d your brain takes this literally\u2026be careful of your words even just to yourself.
