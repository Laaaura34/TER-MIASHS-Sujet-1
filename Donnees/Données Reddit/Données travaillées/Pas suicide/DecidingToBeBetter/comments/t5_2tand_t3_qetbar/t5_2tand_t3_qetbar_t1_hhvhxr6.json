It\u2019s very different from high school. Studying design can be even harder, because there is no right answer what the final product supposed to be (that would make me also even more anxious). But in your case if you see something that makes you interested in the course, even a little thing, then I would advise you to just push yourself trough course. Later in life, if you don\u00b4t like it, you can always study somthing else.\n\nBtw just by clancing over your post history, I would say that your too hard and critical on yourself! the constant overthinking about every aspect of your life is exhausting to your mind and body. I would say its even a form of procastination. You think that most people also see you the way how you think about yourself, but it is definitely not true. Everyone has their own shit they need to deal with. \n\nJust take it easy! negativity doesn\u2019t help you in any way. There is no easy or fast way to better yourself. Maybe try make a list of things you dont like or need to do or finish and then think the solutions to them. Start do them one by one. \n\nAlso definitely don\u2019t forget to relax, take breaks and enjoy your free time.\n\nI hated college. So many useless lectures and noone to help. Tried to even drop out, but friend of my parents conviced me otherwise, so I finished with my degree with extra years . Now I am very happy I pushed through.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qetbar/college_is_killing_me_and_idk_what_to_do/hhvhxr6/"}
