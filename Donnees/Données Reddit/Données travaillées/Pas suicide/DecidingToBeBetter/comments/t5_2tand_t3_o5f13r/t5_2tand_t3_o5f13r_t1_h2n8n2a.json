If you can manage to, get down to the gym. I started it recently, it's great to have as you can go with your pals or by yourself. I usually go down to the gym late evening when I'm not playing rocket league with my mates that evening, I put in an extra hour graft into work on the days to fill the time till I go gym. I find by the time i'm back, i've passed out in bed before a negative thought has even came to my mind.\n\nSounds like you are coming out the dark though mate.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o5f13r/finally_standing_up_by_myself/h2n8n2a/"}
