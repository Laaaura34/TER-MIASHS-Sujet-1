Your an adult and you feel you should have all your shit together by now, decisions feel like they have more weight than ever, and in a lot of ways they do.\n\nAs far as the breakup, I don\u2019t think the long list of reasons is necessary. Your gut told you that this relationship isn\u2019t for you long term, and when it came to decision time you aborted. I don\u2019t think you can do much better than that. If I have any advice it\u2019s to get the idea of \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d decisions out of your way. Stay loose and follow your gut, interesting stuff will come your way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of6vxh/at_22yearsold_i_feel_like_an_adult_with_no/h4awi2y/"}
