You don't need to rationalize them.\n\nIt sounds like your relationship was winding down naturally.  Just because something works out without conflict or any obvious issues doesn't mean it's meant to be.  \n\nYou broke up just a few days ago after being together for four years.  That's a long time.  You may need some time to grieve.  \n\nBack to my first point, 'cause it's important:  your feelings are **always** valid.
