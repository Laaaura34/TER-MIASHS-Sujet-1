Just realized I\u2019m on Day 250 of no booze after 15 years of daily drinking. A damn beverage almost destroyed my life but I\u2019ve got it back now. Had 82 days before the 250 but relapsed for about 2 months in April/May. That whole moderation thing just irritated me so I quit again & am so glad. If you\u2019re interested in just how many people are with you on stopping or cutting back & some of our daily thoughts, check out r/stopdrinking. Very supportive folks there. Never even heard of reddit until the day I first quit back in Jan 2019 & googled up where I could get some online help. The sub, the ppl & their stories, the book recommendations-all very helpful. Wishing you continued success. You can do it! Ten days may not seem like much to you now but it\u2019s a huge accomplishment. Good on you!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ez27is/ten_days_no_booze/fgkrcew/"}
