Observe people, and ask yourself WHY you think the things you think. WHY they might be doing what they're doing. Just go along and see how often you're right. The more you chat, and chat with different people, the easier it becomes to read them. I don't think I began trusting my own opinions until my mid/late 20's-- but probably could have started much sooner.\n\nAlso, don't assume that other people necessarily know what's going on. They may just be sharing their opinion on a situation, and presenting it as fact. The best advice I can give you, as a formerly naive person, is just be less trusting. Investigate if someone is pushing a narrative on you, and try to figure out if they have a reason for holding a particular narrative/motive.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lj12u6/improve_social_skills_become_street_smarter/gn9ma1r/"}
