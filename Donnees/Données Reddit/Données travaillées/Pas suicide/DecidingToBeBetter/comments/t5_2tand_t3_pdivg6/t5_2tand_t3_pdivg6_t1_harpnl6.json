However, not feeling good is not the problem. If the medications affect your ability to focus, I would\nimmediately mention this to your provider.\n\nI suggest the most important thing is to educate yourself and learn to trust yourself and be proud of yourself.  Start with little victories. There is a great video of a navy admiral at a graduation speech suggesting you start by making your bed every day. I do that. When that bed is made I have my first victory for the day.  Make changes slowly. Don\u2019t try to make up\nfor all your past sins at once. It backfires. When it backfires, take smaller steps until it is solid and in place. Then add another one\u2026\n\nI have been where you are. Don\u2019t give up.Small steps and thank you for reaching out. This is a\nvery supportive community that has your back!\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to celebrate each little victory.  They add up.  It eventually has all that self criticism we have floating in our heads go\nto the background.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdivg6/how_to_stop_being_depressed_all_the_time/harpnl6/"}
