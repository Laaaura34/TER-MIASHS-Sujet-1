Remember that you are \u201cshopping\u201d for someone you can connect with and trust. No one will be offended if you stop going to see them. If you can, getting on medication will also help.\n\nSomething that helps me is when I\u2019m feeling particularly down is going outside. Getting out into nature, even if it\u2019s under a tree in the city, helps improve your mood. \n\nAlso, start to put together a \u201cDepression Toolkit\u201d. You can \u201cfill\u201d it with things you love that make you feel better. Some of my \u201ctools\u201d are: play with my cat, take a hot bath, call my grandma, sit outside for 10 minutes, and read a favorite book.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdivg6/how_to_stop_being_depressed_all_the_time/har4205/"}
