I am sorry for the pain you have had to endure.  \n\nYou do not know what has happened to me or the trials I have had to endure.\n\nAll I know is once I let go of my victimhood, I found freedom in relationships.  I found how to be likable and how most people have a story of pain but they don't advertise it.\n\nThere are a million ways to navigate the pain in life but I think the most important is family(or friends you've chosen to be family) and the continued pursuit of growth.\n\nWarm regards on your journey.\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4cessx/how_to_be_strict_and_not_be_taken_for_granted/d1hzrza/"}
