My setback has been that I\"m afraid of being a nuisance to other people. I've been told many times in the past that I don't really do things correctly so it scares me to try to do things for other people in case I mess up, but, I might start anyway. If nothing else there's a shelter up the road I've been dying to get into so I can help the animals in there. That may be where I start since it's close and I can't really mess up feeding a dog or a cat.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5zztvg/how_to_accept_myself_for_what_i_am/df4mnp2/"}
