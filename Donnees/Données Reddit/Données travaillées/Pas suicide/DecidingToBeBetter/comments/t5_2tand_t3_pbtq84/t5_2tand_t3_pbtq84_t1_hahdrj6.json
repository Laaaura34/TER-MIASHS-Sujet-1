You don\u2019t just start with all these aweosme crazy abilities and stuff.  You need to grind and build them up.  \n\nOr like same with working out.  I need to build up my strength stat.   Gotta do my \u201cdaily\u2019s\u201d and pump iron over and over. \n\nGotta build up my stamina stat.  How do I do that? Grind in miles.  Just walk or run or bike miles and miles and miles.  \n\nOr like a game the sims.  Your first painting is garbage and worth 2 bucks.  But the more you do it, the more you build up that stat and after awhile your paintings can be sold to support yourself! \n\nOr the cooking stat in the sims.  Cook pancakes 500 times and somehow my house becomes fireproof!!! \n\nWell.... maybe not that last one \ud83e\udd23", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbtq84/small_victory_but_i_didnt_play_any_video_games/hahdrj6/"}
