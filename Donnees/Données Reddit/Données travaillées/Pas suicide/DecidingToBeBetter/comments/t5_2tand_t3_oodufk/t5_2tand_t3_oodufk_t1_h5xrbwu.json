Me personally? I needed to see this. I\u2019ve been dealing with some toxic parents as well. I finally moved out about 2-3 months ago now, but as your comment stated, I\u2019m having trouble coping with it. To be frank ive been sheltered by my parents all this time so I\u2019ve gotten comfortable, not only with the toxicity, but just not having them as a crutch anymore either. Which most days I feel okay, I\u2019m realizing this is the best way to build a stronger relationship, lord willing, with them. But it hasn\u2019t been an easy road so far. This comment right here has definitely brought a better perspective to the front of the line!
