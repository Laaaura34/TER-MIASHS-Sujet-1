The argument that you cannot change people through discussion and emotional appeal is in my case completely incorrect.\n\nMy father used to physically discipline me. He thought it was the ideal way to raise your children. When I grew older, I expressed to him how this felt terrible to me and he listened to a certain extent. He did not physically discipline my younger brother. He changed because of my plea with him. He also used to think gay people are bad, but also through discussion of personal freedoms, his stance has become that they can do whatever they want, and he will not advocate against them. \n\nYou can argue that truly, only the person who is open to change can change, but to completly negate others role in that change is in my experience and my observations in life completly incorrect. We all have an effect, one way or another. We strive to change people in society all the time, the entire concept of therapy and rehabilitation is change. Those are factual, studied, and documented, and no evidence atm can even begin to refute that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g2lmqb/people_are_not_going_to_change_i_need_to_change/fnpta6y/"}
