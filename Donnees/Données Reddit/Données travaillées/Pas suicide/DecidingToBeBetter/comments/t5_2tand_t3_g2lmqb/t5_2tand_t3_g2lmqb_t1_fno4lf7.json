You can be better but you're already in the +. \n\nExpecting your drunk mom to sober up is normal, because that's what a good person would do. Expecting your dad to stop getting caught up in politics negatively is normal, because that's what good people do. Expecting your friends to stop doing drugs and get their life together is normal, it's what good people do. If those people hurt you because of their faults, the burden of change is not on you.\n\nYou do not have to change people, but expecting people to be good human beings and citizens is one of the pillars of society and a healthy relationship. If you're changing yourself because of the faults of others, reevaluate your self-confidence as you might actually be lacking it. In the end, accepting the (severe) faults of others now might help you feel better, but it the future it might actively ruin your relationships and life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g2lmqb/people_are_not_going_to_change_i_need_to_change/fno4lf7/"}
