There is a difference between having people conform to your ideas and asking people not to be bad. Whether we like it or not our friends are family share our lives and their behaviour and personalities directly affect and influence us. I would have a problem with my mother being a drunk because it decreases her life span and possibly make her shitty towards me, how many kids were orphaned or abused by drunks? I would have a problem with my dad becoming hung up on politics because it would ruin my relationship with him. Friends doing drugs? One of my acquaintances, who never touched drugs, was killed accidentally when some person was targeting his friend he was hanging out with, who we had no idea was actually involved in gangs and drugs. Master yourself all you want but life is not fair. The acquaintance that died didn't even do anything, and as a collateral lost his life to his friends shitty decision.\n\nPeople affect use whether we like it or not, master yourself all you want, have the self confidence of the gods and don't judge people all you want. One way or another, hanging out and and tolerating bad apples WILL spoil your harvest.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g2lmqb/people_are_not_going_to_change_i_need_to_change/fnpuhus/"}
