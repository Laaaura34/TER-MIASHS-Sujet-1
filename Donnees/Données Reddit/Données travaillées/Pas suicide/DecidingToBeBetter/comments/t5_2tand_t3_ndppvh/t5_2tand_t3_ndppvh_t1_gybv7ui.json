But what I\u2019ve been lacking is motivation to do more. I\u2019m a creative person, I write, podcast, make videos. But I can\u2019t seem to maintain my commitment to all this.\n\nThe one thing that keeps me going is my partner. She\u2019s the one that reads and watches my stuff, so my motivation is her, to entertain her, to make her smile, laugh, and feel good. While I can\u2019t always do that for myself, doing it for her keeps me going.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ndppvh/whats_your_motivation/gybv7ui/"}
