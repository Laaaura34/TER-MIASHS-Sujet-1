I keep pushing myself, but I know the \u2018under construction\u2019 sign will probably never come down. And yeah, I\u2019m grateful to have someone with me who keeps me propped up.\n\nAs for yourself, I\u2019ll pass along something my psychologist tells me: Don\u2019t focus on being happy. Happiness is fleeting, temporary. Instead, focus on being grateful. He has me sit with my eyes closed and start naming things out loud that I\u2019m grateful for. So I\u2019ll name my partner, my dogs, the fact I have a working vehicle, a job that pays my bills, that I have books to read, music to listen to, things like that. \n\nI hope you give it a try and that it helps in some way.
