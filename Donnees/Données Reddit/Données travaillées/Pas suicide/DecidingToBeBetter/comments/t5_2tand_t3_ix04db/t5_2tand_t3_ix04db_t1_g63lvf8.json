When gyms closed cause of COVID that was rough for me, cause exercise was a great outlet that also served as an impetus for other healthy choices in my life.  \n\nStrangely enough, I\u2019ve been able to exploit the stubborn/self-conscious part of my brain and exploit RPAN of all things to keep myself accountable.  I\u2019ll start a broadcast, say that I\u2019m gonna exercise for X amount of minutes (for myself it\u2019s rowing), then put it mostly out of view.  If I even think people are watching me (and judging me if I quit early), it jury-rigs my brain into not only following through on the workout but creates accountability to continue doing so.\n\nWeird, but it\u2019s helped me at least.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ix04db/just_some_thoughts_on_what_i_want_to_accomplish/g63lvf8/"}
