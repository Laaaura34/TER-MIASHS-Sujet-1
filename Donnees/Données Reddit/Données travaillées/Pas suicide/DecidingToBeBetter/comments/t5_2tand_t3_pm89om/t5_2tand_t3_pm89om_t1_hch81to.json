I thought everything was OK, but he felt neglected and we almost broke up. \n\nDifferent people need different levels of attention. Some people need daily reassurance and quality time, other people are OK with less than that and tend to feel smothered more easily.  \n\nIf I were you, I'd talk to your partner, and ask them how they think things are going. What would they change? Would they appreciate more quality time with you? Are any of your projects things they would be interested/able to help you with? \n\nPerhaps you have to set aside certain hours of the day or a certain day of the week where your work/projects are off limits. Perhaps you need to do certain things to make them feel loved, depending on their love language. \n\nHope that helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm89om/how_do_i_24m_balance_being_very_ambitious_and/hch81to/"}
