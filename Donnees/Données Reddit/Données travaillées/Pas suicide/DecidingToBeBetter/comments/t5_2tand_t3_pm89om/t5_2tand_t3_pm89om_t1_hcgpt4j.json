I work long hours constantly.  I have a 9-5 job, I do a weekly podcast which I edit, I'm starting a company, and I help a community of entrepreneurs with their companies.\n\nI made it clear to my girlfriend from the beginning that I am very ambitious.  I have no interest in wasting her life if she thinks this is just a temporary thing, as it's not.\n\nI make sure that when I can dedicate time to her, it is dedicated to her, not to being off doing my own thing.  I like to set scheduled weekly events I can do with her, like a Monday dance class.\n\nI make sure that my place is very accessible to her, so that if she is over when I'm working she has things she can do, clothes, games, whatever she is into I make sure she has it accessible at mine.\n\nFinally I also try and involve her in my thoughts on my work, decisions that are bugging me I talk with her about.  I hope this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm89om/how_do_i_24m_balance_being_very_ambitious_and/hcgpt4j/"}
