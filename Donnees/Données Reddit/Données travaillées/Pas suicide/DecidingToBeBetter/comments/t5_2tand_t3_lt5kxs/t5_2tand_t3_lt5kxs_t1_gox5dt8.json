I\u2019ve tried reading \u201cDigital Minimalism\u201d and \u201cHow to Break Up With Your Phone\u201d and as embarrassing as this is I haven\u2019t been able to make any new habits really stick thus far. It seems like whenever I stop using one social media, I replace it with another. It definitely is my fault and I keep telling myself I need to try harder. Ultimately though, it might just be the best option to go cold-turkey even if I don\u2019t feel ready. It feels like a losing battle to use a device that as you said is designed to be addictive without being addicted!
