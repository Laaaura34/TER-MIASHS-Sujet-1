I\u2019d love to do something like that. That\u2019s a really great point, I think my smartphone can definitely take away the time I have to be bored or just exist. Times like those are when I used to be motivated to do things I actually enjoy doing like drawing or reading. I have practically no hobbies now and it\u2019s so sad to me because I\u2019m not really being fulfilled by using my phone, I\u2019m just being pacified. One of the things that scares me the most about switching to a different phone is all of the random inconveniences I\u2019m going to have, but I do have to remember that people lived without smartphones just fine before so I should certainly be able to now! Thank you so much!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lt5kxs/getting_rid_of_my_smartphone/gox4e9r/"}
