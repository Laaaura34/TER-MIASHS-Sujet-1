I\u2019ve struggled so much through the years because I want to ensure every day I do something \u201cproductive.\u201d I even had issues in my last relationship because I felt he didn\u2019t care about being productive, when he actually did fulfilling things, and it\u2019s kind of like what I like to do too... Different story, but anyway: I consider doing fulfilling things then, being productive. I always just say: I need to be productive, and working on my art, reading, etc, feels like so, but by saying that word instead of \u201cfulfilling,\u201d perhaps I am putting too much pressure on myself and even I give that reflection of myself to others... Like I have \u201cno chill,\u201d instead of showing that I enjoy my time too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fwz68k/take_that_perfectionism_changing_my_language_to/fmv0vrd/"}
