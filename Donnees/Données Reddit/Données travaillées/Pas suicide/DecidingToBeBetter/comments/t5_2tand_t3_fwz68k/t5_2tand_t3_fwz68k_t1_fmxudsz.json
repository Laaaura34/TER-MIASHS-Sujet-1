Reframing your thoughts tends to be a pretty powerful technique to change things. It takes work and self reflection. Honestly I love my therapist and I recommend therapy to everyone. It provides the benefit of also fast tracking learning and growing because you have help, and a support system. One day at a time. And if you have struggles and underlying issues from childhood, they could be the reason you're struggling with that. Been there friend. Take good care of yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fwz68k/take_that_perfectionism_changing_my_language_to/fmxudsz/"}
