I used to think I had ego issues (I have those too but realized later it's probably a symptom) and brushed it off for years but I'm starting to see it's perfectionism and it's likely getting worse because I've been ignoring it. I get so stressed about not doing things right that I can go from mildly upset to full breakdown if there's a lot of buildup. If it's not something work related that I have to do, I'll typically put things off so I don't deal with it. Been slowly easing myself into being better but damn it's hard. Here's to having more fulfilling days, cheers and thanks.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fwz68k/take_that_perfectionism_changing_my_language_to/fozm6cv/"}
