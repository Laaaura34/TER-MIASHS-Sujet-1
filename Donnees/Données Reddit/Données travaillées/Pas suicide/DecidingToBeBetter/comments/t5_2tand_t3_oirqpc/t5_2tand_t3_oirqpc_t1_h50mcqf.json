You clawed your way tooth and nail to a better self. \n\nYou say you missed out on getting a master\u2019s degree, but why can\u2019t you work towards getting it now or in the next decade? Especially if you believe it will open doors in your career and lead to higher earning potential? After all, the next 35 (working) years are going to pass by, whether you get a degree or not. \n\nAs with many issues we all face, the only way out is through; be thankful for what you\u2019ve got and look hopefully towards the future.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oirqpc/realization_peoples_problems_feel_hard_to/h50mcqf/"}
