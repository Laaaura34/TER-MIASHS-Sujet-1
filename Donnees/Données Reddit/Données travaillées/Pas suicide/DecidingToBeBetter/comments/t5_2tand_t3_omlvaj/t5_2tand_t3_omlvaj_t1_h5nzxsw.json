I was able to get a full time job but seeing all my friends enjoying their part time job, going out every night summer vacation, always makes me feel guilty for getting a 9-5. I\u2019ve recently tried deleting most of my socials (or at least logging out of my account/deleting apps). I always caught myself looking too deeply into lives of friends and acquaintances and wasting hours of my time scrolling through everyone\u2019s stories and feeling like my life wasn\u2019t enough every time. \n\nIt\u2019s probably been a month since taking a step back from socials and I\u2019m having such a better time mentally! I\u2019ve been watching more shows and started deeply cleaning my house. I\u2019ve been walking around my neighborhood. Seeing old friends who I never felt like I never had time to see\u2026 I definitely recommend the step back if that seems like something that could help. I still have Facebook and Instagram but I don\u2019t feel nearly as much pressure to check messages or respond or like peoples posts any more cause it\u2019s just not a habit like it used to be! And I really enjoy the space of Reddit and how it\u2019s not my personal friends, but my interests and hobbies (and cool ass strangers)! \n\nI hope you start to feel more fulfilled with your life as I know how difficult it can be especially with people our age. We got this!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/omlvaj/trying_to_live_more/h5nzxsw/"}
