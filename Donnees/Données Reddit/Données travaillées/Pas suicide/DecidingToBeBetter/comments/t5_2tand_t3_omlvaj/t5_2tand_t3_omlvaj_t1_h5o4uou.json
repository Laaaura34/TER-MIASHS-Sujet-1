But you NEED to and CAN set aside 1 hour per week to do something fulfilling. You deserve it and you can make it happen.\n\nI never mentioned traveling. If you can't even get out of your house/ neighborhood, look at more simple options like going for walks, learning art, listening to educational podcasts while you do chores/ work or learn to cook which is a skill that can be very fulfilling while serving a purpose.\n\nIt's all about how you choose to spend your time.
