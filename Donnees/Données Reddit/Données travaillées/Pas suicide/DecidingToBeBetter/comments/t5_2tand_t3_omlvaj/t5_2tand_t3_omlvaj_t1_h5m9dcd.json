I work directly next to people that are 7 years younger than me and 10+ years older than me. People have different values and that\u2019s what will lead them to chasing money, or a fancy car, or a family, or whatever. I chased the corpo life/ big paycheck for a while and found that I absolutely hated it. I bake bread now for near minimum wage and am the happiest I\u2019ve ever been. 20s seemed to me to be the best time to try stuff out and see what resonates. Find people that are passionate about what you\u2019re passionate about and you\u2019ll never feel like time was wasted.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/omlvaj/trying_to_live_more/h5m9dcd/"}
