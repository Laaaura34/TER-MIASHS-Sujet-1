I want to Play. I've been working my ass off the last 14 years. I can't pick up a pencils to draw or controller to game without feeling like utter shit because \"this isn't making me any money\". If I'm not working, I'm at the gym or driving to/from work or taking classes \"to be more well-rounded\" or reading self-help books. I'm fucking miserable. I don't even know what makes me happy anymore. I am fucking tired of working, goddamnit. That is not my fucking purpose God fucking dammit it. I would fucking kill just to be able to sit and create with no pressure and no piece of shit voice in my head telling me it's pointless and useless and not productive. I miss playing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opdgv5/you_dont_need_motivation_you_need_to_work/h65ajzq/"}
