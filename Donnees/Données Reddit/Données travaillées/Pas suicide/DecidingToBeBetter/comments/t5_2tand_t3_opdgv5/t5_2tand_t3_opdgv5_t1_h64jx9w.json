I don\u2019t know why, but when I think of how long it is going to take to complete a task, or how many steps there are, I get really overwhelmed. So I put a timer on and say \u201cI\u2019ll just do this long and then I can stop\u201d but like 75% I keep working a lot longer than that. Sometimes I\u2019ll stop after 15 minutes and that\u2019s fine too, because at least progress was made. Sometimes I just putter around helplessly for fifteen minutes, but at least the idea is in my head and I\u2019m kind of thinking about it, so the next day I have more momentum.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opdgv5/you_dont_need_motivation_you_need_to_work/h64jx9w/"}
