That feels so depressing.\n\nWork, but treat yourself kindly. Work, but forgive yourself if you don't meet all of your expectations. Work, but take time to relax. Work, but don't tie your self worth to success. \n\nRemind yourself that the journey to being a better version of yourself will involve mistakes and failures and treat those as a learning experience. You aren't going to wake up tomorrow and have all of your goals achieved. So be kind to yourself on the journey.\n\nJourney before destination.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opdgv5/you_dont_need_motivation_you_need_to_work/h66ylm5/"}
