How many have I known that simply have grand ideas but never put forth even the designing of the plan to make these ideas a reality. Self belief is nonsense if you don't have the backing to see it through. The resilience to continue on after the first obstacle or failure---and then continue on with the next twenty five of the same. Success comes from having a \"get busy living or get busy dying\" attitude. The person who decides to change his physical being doesn't wait for the new year. He decides that moment and joins the gym that evening. The person who wants to be promoted doesn't day dream about it. He begins that process of that next certification for his resume that night. That lofty writer (as I know full well) doesn't think about his book. He opens his notebook, grabs a pen and starts writing. If it is a page of garbage then he makes it a little less so the next day. Remember what my mentors Think Media say regarding that youtube channel. Success isn't a sprint--it is a marathon. Hope that helps--Charles.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opdgv5/you_dont_need_motivation_you_need_to_work/h66y2qk/"}
