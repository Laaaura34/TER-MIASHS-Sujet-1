That makes me wonder this sometimes:\n\nMaybe every person with a lack of self control has an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex (or at least a temporarily malfunctioning one of some sort) and a dopamine regulatory problem, but not enough to be classified as ADHD? And as a result, they don't even get a justification for their actions from the society and get shamed for their actions more than those who have the condition. Just a thought, not sure if it's true.\n\nBut I suspect it might be true. Because I feel like nature doesn't have any black and white conditions, like this is ADHD, and that isn't. Like where does nature draw the line beyond which you can be classified as diseased?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opdgv5/you_dont_need_motivation_you_need_to_work/h68go6d/"}
