I was sitting here doing everything but what I really should be doing which is to write 1,300 words today for my [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org) (National Novel Writing Month) challenge.  I am almost at 40,000 words with another 10,000 to go.  I have until the end of July which is another 10 days.  This book has been burbling in my head for the last 30 years.  It is time to get it out and thanks to you the next thing I do will be to go write on my book.  Thanks for the kick in the pants this morning.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opdgv5/you_dont_need_motivation_you_need_to_work/h65ju3i/"}
