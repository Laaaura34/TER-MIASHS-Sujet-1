Could have said nothing, could have provided an alternative perspective, but instead you decided to exclusively offer a weak prejudice about \"people who support capitalism\" as if there isn't more variation within that group than similarities. And I'm sorry but if you judge the menial couple paragraphs I wrote as adequate to understand my views in any depth, and judge severely as atrocious, so much so to put yourself above that conversation, then there's no faster way to deny the opportunity to discover how much we have in common, which is probably quite a lot. And it shows how much you've already put me in a box, and one that doesn't even seem coherent to be honest.\n\nSaid nothing about engaging, but you engaged nonetheless in a way I don't really understand. Just to call me weird and with atrocious views that were barely even expressed or expanded on? I mean okay I guess, it just comes off like \"I only want to engage insofar as saying you're wrong and you suck, but I don't talk to people like you.\"\n\nI don't really get the point.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opdgv5/you_dont_need_motivation_you_need_to_work/h67hwq3/"}
