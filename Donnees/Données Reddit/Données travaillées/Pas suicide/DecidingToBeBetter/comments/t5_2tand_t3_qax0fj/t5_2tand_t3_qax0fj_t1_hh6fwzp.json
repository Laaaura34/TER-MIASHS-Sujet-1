Start trying to find a job that does utilize your skills.  Make a linked in, get a good pic in there and put in your experience and then do the job search thing on there.  You may even have people contact you over time.\n2. Really go through your finances carefully and see where you can make changes.  Most people I know spend a ton of money eating out/getting food delivered.\n3. Develop new skills that are in demand.  Someone mentioned programming which is a good choice but with your film degree you could learn something more along video editing(if you don't know this) or graphic design.  Those can be remote positions which would give you some freedom and broaden your employment search.  You don't need to go to college for those skills either.
