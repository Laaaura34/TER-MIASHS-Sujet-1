Then build your preferred routines from there.\n\nGoing to bed and getting up according to a schedule is very helpful, as is scheduling meal times.\n\nIf you like music, create some playlists of your favorite songs that make you feel ENERGIZED.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qadba6/why_cant_i_beat_my_depression/hh2a36z/"}
