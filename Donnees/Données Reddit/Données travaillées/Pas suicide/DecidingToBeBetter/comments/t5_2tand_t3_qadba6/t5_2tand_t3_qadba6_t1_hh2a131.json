What helps me are the things you mentioned, meditate, routine, exercise - those are the most important - but if you\u2019re focusing on becoming an entirely new person or your vision of a \u201cperfect self\u201d you will always end up disappointed. Focus on each day. Try to live a little better each day by making the hard decisions you know are right and will put you in the right direction. Some days you wont progress and feel like shit. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed or that nothing is working.
