A few years ago I was on disability at the time since I was in a really bad accident and hurt my back. I didn\u2019t have much money, but I went to give him some. We got to talking about our lives and he gave me my money back saying he thought I needed it more than him at the time and he knew how to survive. So instead I\u2019d bring food for both of us to eat and we\u2019d hang out and talk. I learned what he really wanted was books to read and easy food to make like cup o noodles. It\u2019s really sweet what you\u2019re doing. Try asking what they wish they could really have right now or what they miss having to make it more personalized for them. But it\u2019s so awesome whatever you can do and you\u2019re great person for it!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/izl9pw/i_had_an_enlightening_conversation_with_a/g6l7ke4/"}
