What I mean by that is, for example, have you ever been diagnosed for something like ADHD or anxiety or depression?! I have all 3 and find that I really struggle with organizing my day-to-day (building routines) and when I realize I'm failing at my attempts, then my anxiety builds because I feel strongly that I needed to achieve whatever it was I set out to do...which then inevitably leads to depression. I'm giving this as the most severe example (I'm not a total bag of messiness), but perhaps it's useful to look at another angle. Dependence on others is definitely difficult to shake from, but perhaps there are some other things you find out about yourself that can be part of the larger picture and that can be worked on with a therapist. Speaking of, please don't keep utilizing your SO background in counseling as your personal therapist. It's better to find a third party who is not invested in your relationship to help guide you. It also takes pressure off your SO to not have to be your doctor since her job is to be your significant other.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oq2tal/want_to_get_better_but_lack_of_motivation/h693xf5/"}
