I still may try to find places to sit down and just relax with him though. We got him a new longer leash recently, and he'd love to sniff around.\n\nI do to some degree look forward to the time alone. If I decide to challenge myself to not snacking I can without having to worry about my husband wanting to share a snack. He works such long hours and he's always so worn out, I hate turning down ice cream when he wants to sit down and enjoy something together.\n\nWriting has been something I've turned to lately. The other day I was really struggling to stay sober and I just sat down and wrote a story about it. It was freeing, in a sense. I keep finding more story ideas coming to mind but I'm never in a place where I can sit and write them down when they do. I want to try and change that though.\n\nThank you for your advice. I appreciate it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oiy343/the_next_month_is_going_to_be_a_practice_in_being/h4yihd4/"}
