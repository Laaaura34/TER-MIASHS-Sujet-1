Three days. Every other day.\n\nYou'll have a rest day after every workout. And are free to do what you want on the weekends.\n\nIf you happen to have access to a barbell and a squatting rack, I HIGHLY advise you to follow a simple program called: *\"Starting Strength\"*\n\nPlease read my comment, and consider doing this. It has helped me get through hardship, and I have gotten a lot stronger than I ever been.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kquu9c/i_stopped_going_to_the_gym_because_anxiety_and/gi66fw0/"}
