I have this habit of making my goals way too high and then overwheming myself and it sounds like you do too (perfectionism). 1 step at a time, as long as you dont get worse, that is already A LOT. Go to therapy if you can afford to and find some hobbies to relax and enjoy. Some people like reading, painting or drawing or photography, others need exercise to let energy out. Exercise also helped immensely with my depression. A 15 min walk can already change your day. Just try doing 1 thing a day where you have to achieve nothing, something that you just do to relax yourself and for nothing else. Some people even like coloring mandalas or stuff like that. Whatever makes you happy and lets you zone out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/omn39n/people_with_anxietydepression_what_technique/h5mkykw/"}
