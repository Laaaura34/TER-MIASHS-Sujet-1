Small, medium, or big, just one thing. I have a calendar and write a check next to the day to mark something done. It could be taking out trash, cleaning counter tops, emptying the refrig of old food, walking around, or folding clothes.  \n\nThen at the end of the day I can tell myself I did something. \n\nIt mostly applies to weekends for me since I work during the week and that get's me going. \n\nSmall but, something at least.
