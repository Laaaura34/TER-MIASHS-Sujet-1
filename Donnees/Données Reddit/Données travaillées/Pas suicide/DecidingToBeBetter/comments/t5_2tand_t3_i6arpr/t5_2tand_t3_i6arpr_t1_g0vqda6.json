I\u2019m glad that is the case for me. \n\nSome people never get out of that and it makes my heart hurt a little because it\u2019s possible for everyone to get out of their own head and stories and just use the past as a learning tool. There\u2019s a quote \u201cI use my memories but i don\u2019t let them use me\u201d and I think it perfectly describes how the past is important too - just not letting it blindly impact us. \n\nIt really does come down to awareness. I can have compassion for people who aren\u2019t \u201cthere\u201d but it also doesn\u2019t mean I have to sit by and watch them destroy their daily life while trying to take me down with them. Boundaries are key. Sometimes they\u2019re hard. I\u2019m glad you were able to understand the relationship wasn\u2019t healthy for you. That\u2019s huge. \n\nI\u2019m sometimes dramatic. I\u2019m not a saint. I still struggle with understanding where I have power and when I need to deeply surrender to the situation as it is. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever done, this human journey is about experiencing it all, and no ones perfect. Practice makes progress. I can see over the years how I thought I had it figured out only to see that wasn\u2019t true at all. I\u2019ll never have it all figured out but it\u2019s been one hell of a beautiful ride so far! \n\nHope you have an awesome day too my friend", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i6arpr/once_you_realize_you_can_control_your_response/g0vqda6/"}
