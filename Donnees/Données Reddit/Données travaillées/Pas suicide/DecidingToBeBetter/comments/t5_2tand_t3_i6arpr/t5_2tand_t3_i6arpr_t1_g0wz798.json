And the feeling about whatever the something is comes to be the most important thing about whatever it is.  Something maybe everybody else in the world knew long ago is that If I examine, feel, pay attention to exactly what those feelings are, they can change for me.  Most of them are bodily sensations, facial expressions, a way of breathing, muscle tensions - almost all of which can be consciously changed once I've really noticed them.\n\nSo, we're not stuck with how we feel about things.
