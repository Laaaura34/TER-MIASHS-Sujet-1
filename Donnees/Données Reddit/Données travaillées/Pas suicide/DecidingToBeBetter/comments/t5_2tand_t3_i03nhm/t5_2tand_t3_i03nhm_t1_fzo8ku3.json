It is great that you are starting to figure what was making you go back to him or a person like that.  \n\n\nWhether he has his own issues or not it is clear that it was not right and no excuse for him to treat you like that especially since it sounds like you were a lot more vulnerable being totally new to your area.  \n\n\nYou should definitely be proud of yourself for walking away and working to understand what made you stay with him but you should not go back to him. That is a huge deal that people a lot older than you would never work to do.  \n\n\nWish you the best OP", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i03nhm/i_left_my_emotionally_abusive_boyfriend/fzo8ku3/"}
