I know how extremely difficult that can be as a member of this club myself.  Try dating yourself for a while!  Practice self-care, read books, explore your town, and get to know YOU a little bit more on a deeper, spiritual level.  Next time you feel you may be ready to date someone new, you will be in a better position mentally and spiritually to enjoy that relationship.  You deserve the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i03nhm/i_left_my_emotionally_abusive_boyfriend/fzqjjq3/"}
