Most of the problems that you just mentioned are not your fault.  Now I\u2019m not saying you are blaming yourself for them; just that they have nothing to do with you as those wheels have been in motion since before you were alive.\n\n2.  You may want to look into some Buddhist teachings (not preaching religion, just some of the philosophical thoughts) as a good chunk of it deals with the impermanence of everything, specifically focusing on appreciating things that you know will not be around forever and being appreciative/finding the beauty in the limited time you have with anything.  For example (and I\u2019ll admit, this is a terrible example) imagine meeting your childhood hero, and they are everything you had hoped for and more.  Instead of concentrating on how you will most likely never see them again, and how they will probably forget the encounter, always remember how it felt to meet them.  Now just apply that mentality to everything.\n\nSweet Jesus, sorry for my rambling.  Anyway, I\u2019m glad you had a good day, and I hope it continues.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqt8pvq/"}
