Many news outlets were picking up on this figure but many were sensationalizing it, which could contribute to feelings of hopelessness and existential dread. But it\u2019s not accurate. The report found that if we cut emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, we can hold the earth at 1.5 degrees C of warming. 2030 is 12 years away or so, so that\u2019s where the number came from.

Climate change does not have a cut off point, it\u2019s a sliding scale.\n\nSecond of all, I understand how daunting thinking about the environment can be. I should know, I work in the environmental field, in green building, and spent the last five years learning about all that\u2019s going wrong. But I know that we have to remain optimistic and hopeful, because that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to get stuff done. We have to believe in the work that we\u2019re doing, otherwise we\u2019ll fall into despair and inaction. We have to keep moving forward.\n\nEvery day amazing advancements and progress is being made, even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it. For example China and many other countries are working to plant thousands and thousands of trees. Pakistan has planted over a billion trees. The work in energy efficiency and green building is very exciting too. Standards like Passive House and LEED are catching on, as is the Living Building Challenge. Advancements in mass timber means we\u2019ll start being able to build tall wood buildings (and we already are), which are actually more fire resistant and sequester carbon. Renewable energy is making leaps and bounds. And cities around the world are actively pursuing efforts to increase sustainability, as more and more people flock to metropolises. NYC has now banned new tall glass buildings I believe, which are not very efficient, and existing ones will undergo retrofits.\n\nThe future is not lost and there are many ways to get involved. Perhaps local committees on energy and sustainability, lobbying your policymakers (seems you\u2019re in the US), see if you can support your state\u2019s renewable energy portfolio/goals, many states have one. Work with/support the Nature Conservancy, or Natural Resources Defense Council, find a local Sierra Club chapter. Join your town or city\u2019s planning commission, attend meetings, VOTE. Make your house/apartment more energy efficient, \n\nI truly hope this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqtzzld/"}
