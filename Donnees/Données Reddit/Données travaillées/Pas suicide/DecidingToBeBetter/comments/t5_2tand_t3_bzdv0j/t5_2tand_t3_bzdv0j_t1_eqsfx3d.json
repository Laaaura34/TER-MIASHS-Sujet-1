Lets look at just one example. You believe that water is going to be a rare resource in the future, and that's an understandable fear. Droughts are everywhere and some places desperately need water. The thing you and those in the same mind set as you might not think about though, is that people are looking at these problems and they come up with solutions all the time. Practical solutions too, not just stuff like changing human nature (although that helps too). Have you ever heard of cloud seeding? Great show of this, and perfect for this example. We have developed ways to literally control when and where it rains. It's still being improved upon ofcourse but point is stuff like that is being developed all the time to fix problems. You won't hear when a problem is fixed, being fixed, or even being looked at, but that doesn't mean there aren't people working on it. \n\nI find it kind of funny actually. When you look at all the problems we have it seems hopeless. Get rid of generalities though, and break down problems into what they really mean, and you'll see that we almost always have someone working on an answer, if they not already developed one.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqsfx3d/"}
