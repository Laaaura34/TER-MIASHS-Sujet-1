The media will tell you all the bad news, because we will give the bad news more attention, and they want our attention. Slow down a little and look around the world with your eyes, cause they didnt show you the good stuff: rainbow, poetry, random act of kindness, etc.\n\nI think you should think about the good stuff too not just the bad. And i think yoz should think about what you can control and what you cant. \n\nSorry for my bad english, and wish you the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/equghcz/"}
