Starting small is fine here, in fact, it's probably correct to do so until you get some momentum. \n\nHow's your health (mental and physical)? What are you doing to maintain and improve them?\n\nHow are your relationships? Family? Friends? Lovers? Are they healthy for you and are you healthy for them? \n\nDo you see areas in your life and your closest community that you can improve which will come at minimal cost to your health? Start there and expand.\n\nCareer and finances? Goals and dreams? Etc.?\n\nI used to get overwhelmed by the same type of thoughts, but in the end, I found it was draining and frivolous for me to allocate so many of my mental and physical resources to combating issues and problems that didn't directly influence my life while pushing much more direct and approachable items away.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqs92wf/"}
