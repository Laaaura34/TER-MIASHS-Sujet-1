Extinction Rebellion. I'm not sure if it's actually helpful or will really make a substantial difference, but at the very least it's helped me with very similar feelings of despair and despondence to take action in line with my values and what I know to be true. I'd recommend getting involved with a local environmental group working on non-violent direct action.\n\nAnd I recommend not beating yourself up over stuff like wasting water etc. Obviously it's good to be as sustainable/efficient as you can be, but no matter what, your individual contribution to this devastation is utterly negligible as long as you don't invent some kind of new way to chop down forests or some shit. You could die tomorrow and it would NOT change the course of environmental events for the positive. Individual consumption patterns are meaningless. What matters is what you can contribute to the solutions, and the best way to do that is through activism and protest and civil disobedience, as our governments have clearly and unequivocally shown they aren't going to do jackshit unless we gum up the works enough to have an economic impact.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqskfo2/"}
