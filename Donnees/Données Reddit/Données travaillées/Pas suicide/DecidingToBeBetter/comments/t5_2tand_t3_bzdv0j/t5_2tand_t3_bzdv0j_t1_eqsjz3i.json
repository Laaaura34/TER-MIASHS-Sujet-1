I've talked about it with friends and family alike.  \n\nWhat keeps me going is understanding that I cannot control things that are greater than me. I'm not the leader of a country or company that could have a large enough impact to change the trajectory of our planet. I don't have the means to change the greater scale of politics or climate.  \n\nInstead of letting that frustrate me, I focus on the things that ARE within my control. I reuse my plastic bags for garbage, I'm trying to eat less processed/pre-packaged foods, I walk to places when I can or have the time to, I try to waste as little food as possible. These things may be small, but it's what I can control. I can't control massive corporations polluting our skies or waters, but I CAN at least do my best to inform people about that issue if it comes up.  \n\nDon't worry about a future that you don't have control over, just live your life to the fullest each day. Meet people, go to concerts, read poetry, meditate, go for walks or runs. Enjoy the small things in life and leave your own positive impact on the people around you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqsjz3i/"}
