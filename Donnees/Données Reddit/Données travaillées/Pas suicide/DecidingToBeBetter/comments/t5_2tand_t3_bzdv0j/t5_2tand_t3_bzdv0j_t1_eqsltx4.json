There are many ways you can contribute. Be the change you want to see. If we want to create a movement, the force of our efforts have to overcome the momentum of generations. You have a job to do! And you can create change!\n\nThe fear and anxiety can be useful, not a thing to be denied or ignored. And when you act to fight climate change, it becomes easier to enjoy the things in life with gratitude instead of guilt (from my experience, at least). \n\nDon't forget what a gift the present is. We have time, and living in fear of the future robs you of this. Enjoy it and fight for it, so if there is a hard future before us we, we're stonger for having fought for a better one.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqsltx4/"}
