It opens your heart, and that can feel so uncomfortable at first. But trust that it\u2019s been purposefully shut out in our culture because of the power it holds. I am touched to have been able to spread a positive message to you, the pleasure is mine. I constantly struggle with self doubt still, but I also constantly tell myself that if I can\u2019t even trust myself, who can I trust? You are exactly where you need to be, as is the world, and I believe the goal is to continue to strive to become what we are capable of, instead of living in fear of what we aren\u2019t capable of. Gonna stop rambling now - I hope your week is a good one where you get to reconnect with yourself, nature and all things important in your life \ud83d\udc97", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqs980s/"}
