I'll read an interesting-looking article here and there but it is not a daily thing. No reason to read the disaster of the day, it's always one thing or another and I view it mostly as a distraction.\n\nThe future might be big and scary and the present might suck for most people but really all you can do is change your habits so you don't feel so guilty, and enjoy the time you have. Prepare for the hard times ahead by finding the people close to you, both physically and emotionally, and *helping them*. Nothing is more important than having people you can trust.\n\nAlso: you, personally, are not that responsible for climate change or deforestation or anything. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to live ethically in this day and age, and you personally doing anything(or even a million people doing anything) is not going to make a significant dent. It's not a burden that I think anyone should feel required to do, it amounts to giving up most modern comforts to avoid feeling guilty.\n\nI personally have been thinking about doing that for a while. For other reasons than just environmental concerns, but that's part of it.\n\nAnd no matter how bad tomorrow gets, the sun will still rise, there will still be birds and clouds and trees, children will still play, they're not going anywhere any time soon. And in a hundred thousand years, everything will be gone and changed and unrecognizeable. Isn't that a nice thought?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/equzx9v/"}
