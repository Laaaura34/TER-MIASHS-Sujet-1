I've done some work and research related to environmental regulation, and some of the industry behavior is appalling. If the public paid attention, they simply wouldn't have much sympathy for industry or much patience for concepts like \"over-regulation\" or \"self-regulation\" when it came to the environment.\n \n2) It's eminently reasonable for humankind to modify its activities because of the possibility of irreversible environmental damage and the resulting harm to the ecosystem and our quality of life--but that is not true *because* an apocalypse is likely, only because it's possible. Odds are that we will be able to manage even drastic ecological changes at this point in our technological development. The world might change, life might change, but what else is new? All of this isn't to excuse inaction--it's still stupid to play Russian Roulette.
