I realized that removing the news from my life was the answer. About 6 or 7 months ago I unsubscribed from every news subreddit, unfollowed literally every friend on my Facebook feed (so I could still go there and see the uplifting stuff from the good groups I was in), and unsubscribed from every possibly sub on YouTube that I knew would talk about daily world news. \n\nMy life has gone from a constant depression to almost a 180 after this. The downside is actually being completely out of the loop when it comes to news that's important, but I honestly dont care. My life doesnt need more negativity from outside sources. Especially with all the garbage and fake stuff people share online. \n\nI have made my world only mine and chosen to only expose myself to positive things or things I want to see. That being said, even now and then maybe once every other week, I will seek out a bit of news here and there but it's done wonders for my mood and depression.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqsabp6/"}
