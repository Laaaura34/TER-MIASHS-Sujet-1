I too feel overwhelmed by the sad state of the environment and underwhelmed by my steps to do my part(well, both overwhelmed cause it's a lifestyle change and feeling like it is a drop of water in the ocean at the same time). I have to step back from time to time and remind myself to just do what I can. I can't do everything but I can do something. One day the responsibility won't fall completely on us - one day corporations will (hopefully) step up and play their role in this. I got really excited to see disposable cutlery that is biodegradable. People are creating things that will make our decision to not leave a bunch of plastic all over the earth SO MUCH EASIER. I definitely think you should see a therapist to help with your mindset. Rewiring your thought process takes time and practice but a therapist will give you exercises and tools to be able to feel grateful instead of doomed. And it's great to have someone to check in with on your progress. \n\nTake breaks from regular news outlets and just Read positive news stories. I read a story about how Bhutan is a carbon negative country. That's amazing!!! Maybe research new developments in environmentally friendly products - that always makes me feel proud and hopeful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqt8kt2/"}
