What is it about a higher being that would result a person to \u201cstick [their] fingers in [their] ear and hope god will fix it\u201d Who\u2019s to say we\u2019re not meant to be extinct? Its in our dna to want to stay alive - doesn\u2019t mean we have the ultimate say if we will or not. After all there is no science that says humans are \u201cmore special\u201d than other creatures living on this planet, there is no God claiming we are more special, there is no reason we are meant to be saved. Besides for our own self preservation. There is nothing about us that is deserving of staying alive besides for our self preservation encoded in us, just Iike in the same animals that go extinct, along with other past civilizations that went extinct, along with the potential of life on other planets. You hear the word God and you have religion stuck in your ears probably especially the Christian and Catholic god. But just because someone says God, doesn\u2019t mean you have an idea of what they\u2019re actually saying. While I stick fingers in my ears, you should take yours out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/equhbpy/"}
