That was a terrible depression that caused me to thing that was rational. That's a terrible way to live, and not a way I'm keen on returning to. \n\nIn general, Kindness is the best because you'll often be rewarded for it later, and you'll never lose anything because of it. \n\nAn honest man's mind is much more clear than a liars, for he has only 1 story to remember, and it happened. \n\nAnd finally, sometimes life sucks, but it's funny. I always try to find the humor in things first, whenever I mess up something like driving 30 minutes away from my home only to realize I forgot the suitcase I packed on top of the other car in my garage, and I put it there so I WOULDNT forget it!
