I read about 2 days out of the week. I think this week my goals will be the same but I need to make them more concrete.\n\nI have a 20 mile run goal for the week ( a Nike Run App challenge implemented by my cousin), so I plan to run/walk 4 miles per day this week to accomplish this.\n\nI will read a chapter a day of the book I\u2019m still trying to finish.\n\nI will resist the urge to drink/buy wine until the weekend.\n\nI will go to bed earlier (before 1am) so that my mornings wouldn\u2019t be so rough.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gx80fo/i_may_be_selfsabotaging_so_its_time_to_be_better/fuwk25b/"}
