I was being paid such a piddly amount for a recent graduate in my field, I didn't imagine anyone else made less.  Well it turns out one other guy made about 2k less and took it to heart.

I learned a lesson that day.\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6ux0jm/how_do_i_become_bold_so_that_others_will_not_take/dlwqrwa/"}
