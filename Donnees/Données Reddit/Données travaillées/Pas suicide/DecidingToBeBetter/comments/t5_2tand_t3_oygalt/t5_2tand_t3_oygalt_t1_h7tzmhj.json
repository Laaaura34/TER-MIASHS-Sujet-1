In my unprofessional but experienced in mental health opinion, she is dead wrong. Nothing you described in your post is \"normal\", and even if it was that judgement can't be made by her. A therapists job is to help the patient work through emotions, situations and find healthy ways to cope, no matter how \"small\" or \"big\" the incidents might be perceived. \n\nYou didn't deserve that, but what you definately do deserve is a therapist that won't judge you and will take you seriously. I sincerely hope that meeting her won't put you off from looking for a new one. And I'd again like to reiterate how brave and strong I think you are. It isn't easy, especially at such a young age, to have the insight and willpower to seek help.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oygalt/going_to_therapy_should_i_tell_her_about_my_csa/h7tzmhj/"}
