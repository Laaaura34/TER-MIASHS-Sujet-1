I prefer to be upfront with like a list of my traumas/issues. Just a general description so they know what they're in for and can get to know me better. It feels like they can better recognize certain thought and behavioural patterns that I can't when we're talking if they have an idea of what I've been through. \n\nThat being said, if I'm not comfortable going deeper than the general explanation yet, I say so. And if the therapist is good at what they do then they will respect that. We can agree to keep it on the back burner until we've built up more trust between us and I feel like I can face that specific topic. \n\nYou are not overreacting by going to therapy and from what you've written you have no need to feel embarrassed either. Google toxic shame and see if you can relate. It's one of my big issues from my childhood and your description made me think maybe that has something to do with those feelings. Either way, you did absolutely nothing wrong. You're incredibly strong and brave for reaching out and I hope you and your therapist can work together so that you feel better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oygalt/going_to_therapy_should_i_tell_her_about_my_csa/h7t822a/"}
