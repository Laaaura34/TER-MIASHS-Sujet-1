I'm still in that pit myself, but I am climbing. Start with one thing, add exercise (this really does help, promise). Get yourself up tomorrow, put on sweats, and go for a walk. Just one time around the block, or even just 5 minutes a day. Do it first thing in the morning before you can talk yourself out of it. I made it a requirement before I could have coffee: wake up, walk, coffee, meds, shower, then start my day. Once that becomes routine, add another step to it. Come home from your walk and make oatmeal with fruit for breakfast, or spend ten minutes tidying. \n\nCurrently, I'm a 31 year old autistic single mom living with my mom, working part time and in school part time, heavier than I'd like to be (but not gaining). A year ago, I was an undiagnosed 30 year old single mom about to lose custody due to my toxic relationship, I was unemployed after leaving a job that rejected covid safety, and gaining weight.
