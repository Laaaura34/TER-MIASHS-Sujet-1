Dont give up on yourself.\nDe-pression. You are trying to de-press. What do you feel pressure about? Think about it. \n\n\nWhen you have this concept, always remember. The only person that will be with you your entire life is you. Take yourself on walks, fedd yourself yummy and nutritious food. This approach is weird and I know that, but treat yourself as someone you are responsible for. Would you let your dog /cat starve? If it was sick would you let them die on their misery? \n\n\nIt took me a very very rude awakening in which my life is threatened by a physical disease to dig myself out of the hole of depression....feeling like you are actually going to die (and not the desire or the jokes about \"being dead\") really pulls a 180 in depression. It did for me. And the approach of taking care of myself has helped me to see light at the end of that dark hole. Sometimes I stumble but most days I have a inner purpose, which is to take care of myself the best I can. \n\nI hope this may help you in some way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdxqou/my_depression_has_gotten_worse_now_im_too_weak_to/hhr0mnv/"}
