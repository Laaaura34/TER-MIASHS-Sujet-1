Sometimes, it feels like depression traps my mind in a box and my thoughts can literally not escape. Its a scary place to be in, but please know youre not alone/something isn't wrong with you for feeling this way. \n\nWhat I see in you is a light, a light that refuses to go out. You acknowledge your struggling, and by the comments, your addressing that/caring for yourself by making a doc apt. Go you!! It's really hard for me to motivate myself to do anything when I'm depressed, so to see you go at things like that actually inspires me.\n\nPlease keep pushing through, though that mountain may seem huge now, climbing it is the only way to move past it. I believe in and care about you OP!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdxqou/my_depression_has_gotten_worse_now_im_too_weak_to/hhrihsz/"}
