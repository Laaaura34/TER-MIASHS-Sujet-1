I am 50 years old and have been in a pit of despair and depression for over a year...what has helped me?  Vitamin D supplements because I had blood work done and my levels were low, exercise-even if I have to drag myself to the gym, talking to a therapist (thru my Employee Assistance Program- check&see if you have one-it's free therapy!) and going back to church, even though I'm not overly religious, because it's comforting and soothing and peaceful.  I also texted #741741 and texted a crisis counselor when things got really bad and I just needed to text and not talk- www.crisistextline.org.  So I will pray for healing for you if that's all-right?   Just know that you are not alone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdxqou/my_depression_has_gotten_worse_now_im_too_weak_to/hhvj9ta/"}
