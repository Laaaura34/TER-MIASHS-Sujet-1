I did it 5 years ago. They drove me straight to the psychiatric ward, where a doctor decided to lock me up. Looking back, I now realise it was really the best that could happen to me.\nI've been struggling with depression, anxiety and PTSD for most of my life, but I got better. I used to think I'd be depressed forever. I thought there was jo way out. But for the last 2 years, I've been doing really great. I stopped taking all the pills I used to take, and I don't even see my therapist anymore.\nTher is hope. What you're going through is temporary and you will get better.\nMeditation helped me a lot. Try the Calm app. It's great.\nSending you lots of love.
