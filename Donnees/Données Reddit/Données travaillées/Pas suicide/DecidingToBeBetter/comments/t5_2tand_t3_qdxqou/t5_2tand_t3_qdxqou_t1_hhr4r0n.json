Keep at it. It may take a few tries. It may take medication to break free of the current pattern. And that\u2019s ok. We don\u2019t think of ourselves as weak for taking Advil to cure a headache. Depression is also at some levels a condition of focus. Every second of every day we are training our brain. That means each second is an opportunity to train it to focus on positivity or negativity. Recognizing and taking advantage of the constant opportunity and conditioning yourself to train your brain for positivity is a more holistic and long term solution. I\u2019m battling with depression and anxiety too and so are billions of other people. In that state it\u2019s hard to see that the simplest things can help. Sleep, outdoors, good food, pleasant exercises. I tell myself that if I get on the treadmill I will get healthier. If I do what healthy people do I will be healthier. If I do what happy people do I will be happier. If I start training myself to be positive I will be more positive. It is ok to not be happy all the time. In fact it\u2019s impossible to expect that you can be eternally happy. The key is more about being able to feel all emotions and focus on the positive aspect of each. I try to believe that the universe sings in a musical key and I can tune myself to be dissonant or resonant.
