If you can get to see a regular doctor to run some blood tests and have your vitamin levels checked (I forgot what it is actually called) it could tell you what to work on.\n\nI always get tired when my iron is low, although other things can do that too. B vitamins can help with energy. I do think that blood panel would be really helpful \n\nDon't sweat all the extra stuff, if you aren't taking care of yourself, none of that other stuff will matter! By all means, if being busy helps you not drown me n misery, then be busy with the things you want to accomplish, but do not put yourself into poor health stressing over all that stuff. Do one thing in whatever time you need to do it, then do the next, and so on. Make a list so you can cross things out when they are done and move on whatever order feels right.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdxqou/my_depression_has_gotten_worse_now_im_too_weak_to/hhti1cp/"}
