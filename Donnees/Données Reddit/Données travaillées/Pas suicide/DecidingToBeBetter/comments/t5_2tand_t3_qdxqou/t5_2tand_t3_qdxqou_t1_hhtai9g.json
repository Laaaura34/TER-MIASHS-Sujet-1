I always want to look at the great picture and see the results... What I'm gonna do when I get back home is write down all of my problems for the 1000th time and see what should I prioritize... I also don't feel loved. And I don't have a support system. I have no  friends, I always forget where I leave things.. and I can't  even love myself. Its lonely down here and there's a fine line between applying tough love and being hard on myself that my mind cant seem distinguish. It's a constant battle with myself.
