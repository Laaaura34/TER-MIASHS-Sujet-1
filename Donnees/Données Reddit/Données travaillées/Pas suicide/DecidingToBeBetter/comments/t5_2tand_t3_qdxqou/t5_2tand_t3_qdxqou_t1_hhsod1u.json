I'm not talking running marathons or doing the Tour de France. Just enough to get your heart pumping and the blood flowing. You'd be surprised how you feel afterward.\n\nAnd I'll also recommend a book someone on reddit shared, called Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins.\nHes an African-American who overcame being raised in an abusive household and went on to serve in all 3 branches of the US military.\n\nIt's inpirational and I'll recommend it til the day I die.\n\nHope things work out for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdxqou/my_depression_has_gotten_worse_now_im_too_weak_to/hhsod1u/"}
