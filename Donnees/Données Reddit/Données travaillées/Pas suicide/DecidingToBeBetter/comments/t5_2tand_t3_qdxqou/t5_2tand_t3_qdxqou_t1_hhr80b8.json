You can absolutely get better. Please check out Jordan Peterson's lessons on self help. Put away any preconceived notions you may have about this man and listen to what he has to say about helping yourself. Disregard all the political nonsense surrounding him.\n\nI promise you there is a way out of this dark hole you are in. You have to decide that today is a day that you are going to make a positive change - any change, no matter how small. Even if it is as simple as brushing your teeth today. Every positive change will snowball into a big improvement. Make a hundred tiny positive changes, one at a time, and you'll be unstoppable.\n\nThis is a great place to start. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5RCmu-HuTg", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdxqou/my_depression_has_gotten_worse_now_im_too_weak_to/hhr80b8/"}
