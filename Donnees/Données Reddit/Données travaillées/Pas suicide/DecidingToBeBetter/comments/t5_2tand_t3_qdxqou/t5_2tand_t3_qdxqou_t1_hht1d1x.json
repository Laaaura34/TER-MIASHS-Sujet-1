Start with brushing your teeth, rinsing your face, eating one meal a day, even if it\u2019s just a PB&J or cup of noodles, hell, even using the bathroom right when you feel you need to, or drinking a cup of water. Pick ONE of those things to focus on daily. Maybe 3 maximum. Get into a habit of doing that one thing or those 3 things daily, and in the meantime do easy things well. Like only watching YouTube or Netflix videos that help you laugh or cry. Get comfy blankets, comfy pj\u2019s, comb your hair and put it in a depression bun. Don\u2019t worry about washing it right now. Do this for at least a week. Don\u2019t bring work home with you, release the thought that you HAVE to be productive any other time than after you\u2019ve clocked in at work and before you clock out. Release the burden of feeling like you need to exercise - right now is about your mental and emotional, not physical.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdxqou/my_depression_has_gotten_worse_now_im_too_weak_to/hht1d1x/"}
