I won\u2019t let others laugh at anyone. Not every coping mechanism is healthy.\n\nNo one was laughing. I've tried to explain this to you three times. To me, this coping mechanism would not be healthy. I have tried it so hard that I've made myself worse in the past. I find being kind to myself, letting myself feel my feelz, do what I have to do to get through it, then move forward without any self-flagellation, works best for me. I cannot schedule when my depression hits, nor when it will end.\n\nNow, at this point in my life, I know that it WILL end. That was not always true, and it used to last a lot longer than now. I have the meta-awareness that it will pass, but my body is down in the hole with the bad brain chemicals. I treat myself with kindness and talk to myself the way I would talk to my best friends if they were down. Putting a time limit on a brain chemistry issue doesn't work.\n\nNO ONE IS MAKING A JOKE.
