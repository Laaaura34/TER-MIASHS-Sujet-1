It might not work for you, ok. So you shit talk it?\n\nI did not shit talk it. The only shit talker here is you. I offer a different POV because the one in the OP can hurt people. \n\n> You\u2019re annoying to be honest.\n\nThen block me because I find you more abrasive than sandpaper, and rude, and ignorant to boot.\n\n>  A constant victim mentality because I told you you were rude in a way that wasn\u2019t nice enough for you.\n\nYou didn't call me rude. You called someone else rude while you, ironically, were being ruder than hell. You can't even keep track of who you're talking to. Get off your high horse It's obvious that you are not trying to be better. You're still a bitter, judgmental, ornery jerk. \n\nPlease do ignore me.
