This is part of their treatment.\n\nI don't want to tell you how long I've had it. My treatment would indicate doing the opposite. I'm quite envious of anyone who can schedule it like that.\n\n> I know it\u2019s nice to fester in depression sometimes but a huge part of healing is learning how to fortify through the symptoms\n\nLOL what? It's \"nice to fester in depression\"? No, it sucks. It likes a hurricane (sorry, a tropical depression) for me. I have to batten down the hatches and try to get through it. No sense in forcing myself out before it's over or it will be worse for me.\n\n>  I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re tired of hearing what it takes to get better. That\u2019s on you.\n\nAh, you are fuckin' rude. That's not what it takes FOR ME to get better, and after 30+ decades of depression, I know what works for me. This technique would just make me feel guilty when I couldn't drop it on schedule.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fc5kry/set_a_time_limit_on_your_anxietydepressionbad/fjbubo2/"}
