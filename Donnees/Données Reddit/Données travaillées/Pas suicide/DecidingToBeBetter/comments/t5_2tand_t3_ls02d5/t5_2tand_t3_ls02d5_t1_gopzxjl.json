I try to emphasize to people all the time how powerful the first moment that I realized I had just experienced a moment of genuine joy in 3 years was for me. \n\nThe feeling of absolute hopelessness in depression is indescribable and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. HOWEVER, the feeling of absolutely blindingly bright, shining joy that you feel when you realize that there IS hope and you're actually able to feel a moment of happiness??? I wouldn't trade my years with the black dog following me around for anything. If you can go through that and still feel even occasional joy, you can do anything.\n\nYou brought joy to my day, I hope you're kind to yourself today \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ls02d5/the_moment_you_realize_youre_dancing_to_music/gopzxjl/"}
