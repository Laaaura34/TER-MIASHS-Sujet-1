Music has been one of my favorite forms of therapy for my entire life but it wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that I truly used it as therapy. Now I dance almost every day. It helps me get through the hard days and reminds me that I have the ability to express myself even if I feel alone or trapped. \n\nI\u2019m so happy that you\u2019ve come so far after having gone through so much. I wish you the best of luck in your journey. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ls02d5/the_moment_you_realize_youre_dancing_to_music/goq36sl/"}
