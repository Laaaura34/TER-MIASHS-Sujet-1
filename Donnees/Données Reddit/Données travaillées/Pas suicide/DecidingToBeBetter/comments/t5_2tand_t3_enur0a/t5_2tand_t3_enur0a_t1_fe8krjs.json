They didn't have to be with me. But, by choosing to be with me, they were showing me that they loved and valued me. They saw things in me that my depression and insecurity was burying.\n\nEven though I couldn't see the good in me, I could trust that they did, which at least showed that it was there. I was loved and therefore worth loving and therefore had worth. It helped me build myself back up and helped me change.\n\nGood luck on your journey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/enur0a/i_finally_actually_listened_to_my_wife/fe8krjs/"}
