Not entirely the same situation, but similar. Whenever my wife feels upset about something, or is in a bad mood, I get defensive and take everything personally, even when it has nothing to do with me. We got into a bad fight the other night because of this. I trace this back to the way my dad acted when I was younger, he was a very angry person and yelled at my family a lot. After our bad fight I promised my wife that I would work on this and stop getting so defensive all the time. Just today she was stressed about a separate issue, and I had to stop myself and literally tell myself in my mind, \u201cshe is not mad at me, this has nothing to do with me. Stop getting defensive and just listen and talk to her.\u201d It helped a lot. Changing yourself is no easy task, but we can do it. Good luck man, I wish you the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/enur0a/i_finally_actually_listened_to_my_wife/fe69edz/"}
