It's a juvenile take on long-term relationships and romantic love, both of which are not actually unconditional nor should they be. You're claiming that OP's wife is withholding love from OP when she tells him she is unhappy with his current behavior and is contemplating divorce if things don't change. That is an act of mature love. Long-term relationships aren't just Two People Who Love Each Other - - they are partnerships which require honesty and hard work to maintain. OP and his wife are in some sense like captains of a ship together, and OP's wife is simply telling her partner their ship is sinking.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/enur0a/i_finally_actually_listened_to_my_wife/fe8k27n/"}
