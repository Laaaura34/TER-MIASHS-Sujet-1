Ever since my mum died in August, I have been a moody and unpredictable exactly like you. It takes a lot of effort on my part to push myself to do something. I have also binged on a lot of horrible food and gained a lot of weight in the last few months. I don't feel good about myself, I don't feel motivated to do anything. It's only been a week since I started going back to the gym, I usually walk \\~ 4 kms a day. And I have also stopped eating mindlessly. Things have been really rough with my partner too. I do suggest going to therapy if you can. This is going to be a very long and tiring process, and I urge you to not lose hope and stay strong, and keep resetting back to the positive mindset you have now from time to time if you feel lost again. Do reach out if you ever wanna talk. Much love and good wishes to you and your wife.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/enur0a/i_finally_actually_listened_to_my_wife/fe6suvn/"}
