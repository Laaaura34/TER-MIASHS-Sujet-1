She desperately wants you to get better. She knows she can't fix you. Sometimes she doesn't know what she can do or what she should do, so sometimes it feels like the best thing is to be away from you for awhile (hence the speaking of divorce). But don't take that as something it's not. She loves you. She knows you. She just needs you to make the right steps. Seeing a counsellor would be good for you. But if you don't have the money for that, then try letting her help guide you. And do these things that you've told Reddit you would do. Working out and eating healthy does so much for mental health. And when you're thinking about your late father, talk to her about it. She's your wife.
