I myself never had the chance to experience it much in childhood, but every time we would go somewhere I felt this awe and just general contentedness. I love bright, big, bustling cities and the adrenaline of the unknown. My sister on the other hand hates busy places and crowds of people. She doesn't do well with change, the unknown, or pressure. She is perfectly content living her daily life and staying comfortable at home.\n\nAll this to say, you are not required in any way to travel. If it is not something you enjoy, then don't waste your resources on it. You can have 'experiences' locally, they don't have to be anything grand. If you want to travel once a year, then do it. If you end up deciding you don't want to go, then don't. Social media hypes up travel posts because it usually allows people to see and experience things that they themselves might never get the chance to. Don't let those posts set the standard for your living.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eq2wxn/is_traveling_a_necessity_confused_mindset/fena5jb/"}
