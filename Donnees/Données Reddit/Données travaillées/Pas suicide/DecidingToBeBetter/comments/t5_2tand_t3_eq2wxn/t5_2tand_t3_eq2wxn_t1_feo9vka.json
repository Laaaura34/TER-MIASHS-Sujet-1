A lot of it is fake. I personally don't have the money to take vacations like that, so I'm not too worried about it. I have \"dream vacations\" in mind but it's not something I prioritize. It's totally up to you, and what you think is important! \n\nKeep in mind, instagram is just their \"highlight reel\" -- just happy moments -- so don't compare your everyday life to these influencers!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eq2wxn/is_traveling_a_necessity_confused_mindset/feo9vka/"}
