For a long time I suffered from insomnia and physical pain the only thing that would help me sleep and  help with pain mgmt was weed. But I also have been diagnosed with C-PTSD and at the time I wasn't ready to face the trauma through dreaming so the green helped there too. Now that I'm in a better place mentally and emotionally quitting the green has helped me process a lot of things through my dreams ( I never dreamed when I smoked) and I have learnt to love reading again before bed which has helped enormously with the insomnia. I'm still in pain, that hasn't gone away and I don't think it ever will but I'm managing for now. Plus, with this extended t-break I hope to have a less overly reliant relationship with the plant in the future and move somewhere where it is legal and get access to CBD oil for the pain.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hp8gnc/three_days_of_no_nicotine_or_marijuana_just_raw/fxw2fgq/"}
