I was jobless for about 7 months for a while. So I automatically get really happy for people when they get interviews or jobs. \n\nI got a pretty stressful job at the moment,but the managers and the people are nice,so it makes up for it.\nI am pretty socially awkward,am occasionally struggling with depression due to some shit in my past mostly,and am anxious in dealing with clients. But everything is better because people around me are nice and I can see how they handle their stuff.\n\nI hope you can find something that makes you feel better.
