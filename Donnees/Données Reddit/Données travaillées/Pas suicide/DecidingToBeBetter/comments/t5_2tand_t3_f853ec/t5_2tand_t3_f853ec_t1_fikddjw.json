It's a good cycle. If you really wanna get eco, go back to a thrift store next time you find yourself needing clothing. (wash it at least twice before you wear it...) I got a nice black jacket at my local thrift store for like $20CAD, and I wear it all the time.\n\nOP, you're a good person for wanting to be better. For recognizing that something had to give, good work my friend. You have every reason to be optimistic, and optimism is the only way we can live long lives. I hope you live as long, as healthily and as happily as you possibly can. I wish you the best possible life and I hope that you achieve everything you hope to achieve.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f853ec/changed_my_life_addicted_to_video_games_4_time/fikddjw/"}
