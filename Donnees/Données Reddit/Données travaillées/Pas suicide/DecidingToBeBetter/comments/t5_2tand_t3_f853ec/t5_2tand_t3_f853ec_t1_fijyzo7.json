My problems haven't been that rough but I definitely was addicted to videogames to the point I was failing subjects in college for not attending classes. \nRecently I've started working on myself by eating healthy most of the week, working out 6 days a week, putting priority on school and after I've done this then I can play some videogames. I have started doing NoFap as well which is something I recommend you to do.\n\nThe point of this message is to thank you and congratulate you, I know how grindy MMOs can be (especially Runescape) so you need to have a healthier state of mind go avoid getting addicted go them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f853ec/changed_my_life_addicted_to_video_games_4_time/fijyzo7/"}
