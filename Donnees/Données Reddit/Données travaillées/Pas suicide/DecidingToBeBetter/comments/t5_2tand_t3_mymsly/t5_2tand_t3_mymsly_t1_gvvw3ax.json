I hate the stigma that once you go to jail you'll never find meaningful employment again. That's bullshit and you are living proof of that. Granted you were in and out early in life and haven't gone back but that just furthers my point that it can happen if you work towards it and don't fall back into the behaviors that landed you in jail in the first place. Again, good for you and I wish you the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mymsly/i_went_to_prison_pretty_young_recently_i_got/gvvw3ax/"}
