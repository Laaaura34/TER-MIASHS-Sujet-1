I called my grandparents and they cried because they were so relieved to hear from me.  I decided that I needed to get it together for myself and my family. I started small, aka stopped shooting up, and progressed to not using in any capacity. Its been 116 days since I've used anything but I take it one day at a time. I don't even say I've quit using. I'm taking an extended break and every day that break grows. I also have an app on my phone that tells me, by the second, how long I've been sober. At this point its a competition with myself to keep going. I have the support of an amazing family and partner. And I have a list of very realistic goals that I want to achieve in the next 5 years. \nI also exercise regularly to build up some healthy adrenaline, because I will always love that feeling, I just don't get it from mainlining illegal substances several times a day. I read, write,  and clean a lot. I stay busy. I recently got a job and I think that will help a lot too. I just kinda keep trying. And I avoid places and situations that I know will be too hard to not use in. It's kind of lame advice but its been working for me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j2fzd8/i_am_116_days_sober_today_and_i_am_pretty/g76kue5/"}
