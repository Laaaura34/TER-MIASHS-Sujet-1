You have the right mind set. We all know you have to *want* to get clean. And it seems as if you do. You're doing awesome, and you're luckily over the real bad part! Sounds like maybe you went to some Anonymous meetings, if so you'll understand when I say, p.a.w.s are no joke either..  But, as long as you have a great support system and the will to stay clean, you will! I'm so happy for you & proud of you.
