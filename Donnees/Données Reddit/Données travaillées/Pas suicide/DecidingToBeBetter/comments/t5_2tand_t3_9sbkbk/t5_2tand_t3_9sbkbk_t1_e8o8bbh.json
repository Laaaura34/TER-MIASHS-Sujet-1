Recognizing that you need to make a change is the first step. I've been struggling with a lot of health problems too, but you shouldn't let them stop you from enjoying your life and doing all the things you want to achieve. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first thing to look at is taking care of your health. Change the things that you can change i.e. diet and exercise. A plant based diet has been shown to help autoimmune diseases so maybe that's something to look into. Find yourself a steady exercise routine and set goals. It'll help you get motivated and feel better about yourself. Get with a doctor if you need proper medical help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext look at your career and your future. What goals do you have for yourself? Write them down and hold yourself accountable every day to try and do something to further one of them. It may be hard to balance while taking care of your family but this is where time management comes in. Make sure you're utilizing your time as best you can. Try and kick out unhealthy habits that waste your time and detract from your goals. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly pick up a hobby, do something you enjoy even if it's for a couple of times a week. Give yourself that mental break from your routine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck, it's never too late to change!
