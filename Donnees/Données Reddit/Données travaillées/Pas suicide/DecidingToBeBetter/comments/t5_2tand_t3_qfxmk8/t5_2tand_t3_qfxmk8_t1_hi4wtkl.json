Investing your time in social media and porn is the opposite of what you need.  Like one response suggested, take up an active hobby or volunteer in some capacity.  Animal shelters are always looking for volunteers, especially now with people are dumping pets they got when they were in lock down.  Other ideas are homeless shelters, youth centers, senior citizen homes, etc., just something in an area that interests you.  Also, volunteering doesn\u2019t mean you have to work directly with the clientele, you could do office or IT work if that suits your skills better.  Just anything that gets you away from the house and thinking of something or somebody other than yourself.  Plus, it feels good to help others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfxmk8/lost_empty_pointless/hi4wtkl/"}
