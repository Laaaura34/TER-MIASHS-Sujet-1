For instance if you like table top games, see if there's a place near you that hosts games and hold events. You like hiking?

Join the YMCA, get into RC cars or planes. The possibilities are endless.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oqn3z5/33m_finally_feel_financially_secure_enough_no/h6csn88/"}
