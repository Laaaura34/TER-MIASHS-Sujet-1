It's pretty important to not overdo it; If you make anything too difficult or intense it will be difficult to keep up in the long term.\n\nYou'll want to make your changes as sustainable as possible, even if it means overall you progress more slowly. Otherwise you could find yourself burning out and/or falling back onto old habits, undoing all the work you'd have put in so far.\n\nBest of luck OP! You can do it! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7nh6i7/my_life_fell_apart_this_past_year/ds2mruy/"}
