I still have a lot of muscle but it\u2019s not toned and I have too much fat. I agree, it is best to ease back into it. I think my best course of action is running and doing body weight exercises till I get back to where I was. I have been fatigued as of late and these past two months and I\u2019ve hit the gym pretty hard. I think I hit burnout. I think my biggest problem is my diet though.\n\nI really like this second point. I can\u2019t really control what my parents make and I can\u2019t be upset that they\u2019re providing for me, especially with me being employed full-time. I can control those two other meals though. Those I can control and I haven\u2019t done a good job of controlling them in the past. \n\nMy parents are the classic cook too much, eat bad food, get upset when you don\u2019t clear your plate, and don\u2019t want to have leftovers. I think it\u2019s had a big effect on my health and my dad just attributes it to me not hitting the gym. Like no, I hit the gym 5 days a week and work my ass off but I eat like a fucking pig. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t work out it\u2019s because I eat like shit. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7nh6i7/my_life_fell_apart_this_past_year/ds38f2i/"}
