It\u2019s gone pretty well for me so far. I\u2019ve started off with two things in my routine. Making my bed and then meditating on a freshly made bed. It\u2019s put me in a really nice head space. I want to add more things to my routine like this. Not quite sure what else yet but I wanna build a routine to start the morning. It seems like a great way to start my day.\n\nI find myself actually wanting to get out and not just wallow in my bed. I get a fulfilling pleasure from doing something as simple as making my bed. It\u2019s a small change but I think I can keep building off this. \n\nDo you have any advice on building confidence?
