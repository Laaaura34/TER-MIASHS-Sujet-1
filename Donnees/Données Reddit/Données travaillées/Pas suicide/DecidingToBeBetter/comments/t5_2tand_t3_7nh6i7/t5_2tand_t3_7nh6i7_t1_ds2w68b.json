It seems to be along the lines with other people\u2019s advice. Keep the changes small and build off of them. \n\nMy heads in the sky with where I want to go and that\u2019s alright but maybe that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t been able to make changes. I have all these horrible habits that are small in themselves but compound into bad choices over and over again. Thats why I got to where I am. Not because my larger goals are bad. \n\nThanks for this advice and I appreciate the kind words. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7nh6i7/my_life_fell_apart_this_past_year/ds2w68b/"}
