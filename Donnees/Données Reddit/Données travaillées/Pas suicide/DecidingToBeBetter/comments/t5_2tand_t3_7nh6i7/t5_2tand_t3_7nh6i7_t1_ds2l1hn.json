If you don't want to deal with all of that, just do tabata burpees, sprints, running, pull ups, & pushups. Get an 8lb sledgehammer and an old tire and hit the hell out of it. You can get a good workout from just these, at home, in 10 minutes flat without having to drag yourself to a gym. \n\nMost importantly, create a caloric deficit in your diet if you want to lose weight.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7nh6i7/my_life_fell_apart_this_past_year/ds2l1hn/"}
