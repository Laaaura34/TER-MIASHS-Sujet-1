I just started to pick myself up and set aside goals. It can be overwhelming and forced to begin with but over time it becomes easier. \n\nThere's lots of material out there and free worksheets about setting goals and how to break it down, I've been using a few of them to really get down and specific in what I want to achieve and how to hold myself accountable for them. Have you ever heard of SMART goals? It breaks it down to Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely.  It's a good place to start if you're feeling like you need to achieve a bunch of goals.\n\nThere's also a book called The power of habit. That dives into the scientific part of creating habits and maintaining them.\n\nAnyways I hope that helps! All the best to you and your journey. Let me know if you have any questions, just starting out on my journey too. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7nh6i7/my_life_fell_apart_this_past_year/ds2lhgl/"}
