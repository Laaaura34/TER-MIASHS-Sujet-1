My boyfriend left me after 7 years of relationship - I am now forced to move out as quickly as possible, because it is his appartment - we both had very different sights of life and I think we were both not the persons we fell in love after all those years :(\n\nI don't really have any friends left because most of them were his friends and I simply neglected mine (they were all single, went out to party at least twice a week, or moved to another country)\n\nAlso I gained a lot of weight during that seven years and I even was stupid enough to lease a car for us which I can't return without paying a high amount of fees ...\n\nI struggle alot from anxiety and have a hard time getting to know new people/ Don't know where to start..\n\nI cried a lot the first days because I felt broken and alone, but I decided that I am not going to give up in me!\n\nSetting small steps seems to be the right for me. I made a plan on what to do step by step now - because everything takes its time. \n\nOrganization and preparation gives you the feeling to achieve something, even if it is just a little step.\n\nKeep your chin up - I know it's very hard to do so!\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7nh6i7/my_life_fell_apart_this_past_year/dsbiim7/"}
