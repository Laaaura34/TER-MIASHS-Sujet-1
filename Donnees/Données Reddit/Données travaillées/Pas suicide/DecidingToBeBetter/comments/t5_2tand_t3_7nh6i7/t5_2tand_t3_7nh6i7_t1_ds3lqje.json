Take it how you wanna: \"If you want to change your world, start by making your bed as soon as you wake up.\"\n\nIt's in the context of self-discipline. Start your day accomplishing something. Every day, when you get up, make your bed. It's a small thing. But a) that's a great start to get to the next thing which is great to get to the next thing and b) no matter what else you do that day and how much it sucks, you know you did that one small thing...and you can start it again tomorrow.\n\nDiscipline is underrated, especially by the younger generations like it sounds like you are. I'm not going to say \"join the army\" or anything, but there is a real confidence that comes with being disciplined...with doing things right. I'm nowhere near the most disciplined guy myself, but I definitely find that as discipline goes up, so does my confidence.\n\nAll the best to you in 2018, my friend. You can be one of the few that actually makes the upcoming year *yours*, and it sounds like you're on the right track.
