I would throw in mediation. Currently, I'm trying to build habits by letting the environment, or time of day, etc. be the trigger - so they happen more automatically, and by... habit. I also like reading a list of highlights from a couple of (what I think are) particularly good self-esteem books. I revisit them almost daily because the point for me is to internalize these rationales subconsciously. And I try to read a few pages of a new self-help book too, just to keep it fresh and inspiring - none of this takes as long as it sounds. I also cleaned up my phone's home screen and filled it with only the apps I need to do my productive work. Obviousness is important, at least in the beginning, and I need to have these things be what percolates in the background.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgijij/unfollowed_all_hot_actresses_pornstars_etc/g9qokt8/"}
