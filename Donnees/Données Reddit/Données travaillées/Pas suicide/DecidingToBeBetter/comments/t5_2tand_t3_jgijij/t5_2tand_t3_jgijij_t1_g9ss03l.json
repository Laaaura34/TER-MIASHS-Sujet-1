Not correct. And I'm getting downvoted for whatever stupid reason so here's an article from WebMD -\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/men/guide/male-masturbation-5-things-you-didnt-know\n\n**Point 3**\n\n>\"Guys can get hung up on whether they masturbate too much. But it's not how many times you masturbate in a week (or day) that really matters, says Logan Levkoff, PhD, a sexologist and sex educator. It's how it fits into your life.\n\n>If you masturbate many times a day and have a healthy, satisfying life, good for you. But if you masturbate many times a day and you're missing work or giving up on sex with your partner because of it, consider seeing a sex therapist.\n\n>Even then, there's nothing specific about masturbation that's the problem. Compulsive masturbation is like any behavior that disrupts your life -- whether it's compulsively playing poker or checking your social media every other minute.\n\nThere's absolutely no reason to force yourself to stop masturbating if it doesn't affect your life in any negative way, but you do whatever you feel you need to do. I just wanted to point out that there's nothing wrong with it and it certainly shouldn't be shamed. You can be a good man, masturbation has nothing to do with being a good person unless, like I (and the doctor in the article) said, it's affecting your life negatively.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgijij/unfollowed_all_hot_actresses_pornstars_etc/g9ss03l/"}
