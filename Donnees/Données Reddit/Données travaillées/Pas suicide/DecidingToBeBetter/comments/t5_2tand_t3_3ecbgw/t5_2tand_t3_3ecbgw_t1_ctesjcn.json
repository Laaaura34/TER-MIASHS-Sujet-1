I've been trying for like a year now to get into cooking, mostly because buying food from outside is so insanely expensive when it adds up. But every time, I'd go through recipes, and think man, I need new pans and stuff, and I'll never be able to find these ingredients, and I'd just quit. Or, if I do manage to do something, it wouldn't turn out great, and I'd get super discouraged, and I won't try it again for a few months. \n\nThanks so much! I don't know really know how to express this over the internet, but all of these replies are helping so much, the amount of support I got in just a day from completely random people is overwhelming. Thanks. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ecbgw/how_do_i_get_out_of_this/ctesjcn/"}
