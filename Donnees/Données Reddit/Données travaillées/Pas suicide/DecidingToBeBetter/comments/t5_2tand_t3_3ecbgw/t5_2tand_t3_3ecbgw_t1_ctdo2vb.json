The question is: What is stopping you?\n\nAnd that's where it comes into play that you've been molested. You should give it some thought. What it means for you, what you feel etc. \n\nBest thing would be therapy. Because while you've made a big step in noticing the symptoms. You won't change anything by working on the symptoms.\n\nYou have to find the cause.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ecbgw/how_do_i_get_out_of_this/ctdo2vb/"}
