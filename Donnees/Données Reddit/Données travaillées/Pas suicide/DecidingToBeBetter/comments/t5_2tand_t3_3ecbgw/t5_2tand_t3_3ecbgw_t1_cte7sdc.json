It's sad, I know, but it's true. \n\nI like what you said about going to the gym just once a week for four weeks. I always thought of the extreme. I told myself I need to go four times a week, and do this and that and this and that. And I'd get overwhelmed and just quit. \n\nRight now, my mental state is pretty fucked up, and you're right, it does manifest externally. It's evident by the way I'm living. So I guess if I'm to change, the first thing that needs to change is my mental state. \n\nThanks a lot for your response!
