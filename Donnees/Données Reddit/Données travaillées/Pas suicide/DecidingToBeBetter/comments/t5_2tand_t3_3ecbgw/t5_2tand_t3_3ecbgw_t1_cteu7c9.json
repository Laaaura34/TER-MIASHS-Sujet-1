People can be really critical of Reddit, but I've  found the best people on here. Have you heard of No More Zero Days? https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af\n\nPlease, please please read the whole thing. But if you need a TL;DR the basic premise is you should never have a \"zero\" day. Don't ever let a day go by in which you don't do a damn thing. Even if it's 11:59 pm and you haven't done a thing, get your butt up and do ONE pushup. Read ONE page of a book. Make ONE phone call, send ONE email. That way you know you didn't lose that day. \n\nAs you mentioned, you and I were both victims of all-or-nothing thinking. This philosophy completely defeats that kind of thinking: You don't have to read the whole book, read at least a page! It's progress. It's developing a habit of doing something today your future self will thank you for. \n\nI sincerely hope I've helped you. Best of luck. This might sound trite, but deciding you need to do better is a step in itself.  \n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ecbgw/how_do_i_get_out_of_this/cteu7c9/"}
