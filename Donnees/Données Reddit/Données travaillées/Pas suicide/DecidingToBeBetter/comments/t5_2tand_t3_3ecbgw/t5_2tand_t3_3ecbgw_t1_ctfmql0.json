Sounds like something you might need to talk to a therapist/doctor/insomnia specialist about if you're not already doing so. I find it difficult to apply discipline to sleep, because the idea of discipline makes me anxious and sleep is about relaxing. So I try to just change my waking habits so that I'll be more tired around bedtime, and hope the effects flow on. And then just try to make it as easy as possible to sleep, reading paper instead of screens, or whatever works for you. But yeah, exercise definitely helps, and anything you can do to reduce your overall stress levels of course. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ecbgw/how_do_i_get_out_of_this/ctfmql0/"}
