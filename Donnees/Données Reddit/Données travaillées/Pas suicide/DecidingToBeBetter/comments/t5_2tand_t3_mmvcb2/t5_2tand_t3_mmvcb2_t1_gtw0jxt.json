Now, what I mean by that is people who have been a certain way and then realize the errors of their ways and they fight to become a better and a transformed individual. I wish you success as you attempt to become that better person. You will be an amazing person if you are successful and you will help others who need to transform also. There is a book called \u201cLife Traps\u201d. I can\u2019t remember the author.
