I became self aware around the ages of 15/16 so since then i\u2019ve had a great relationship with my mom because she was the person i cared most about having potentially upset in the past. \n\nBut I wonder if i didn\u2019t put so much effort into being as nice as possible wouldn\u2019t i just revert back to being bitter rude or jealous? Isn\u2019t that the natural me at my core and if it is, doesn\u2019t that mean I\u2019ll always be evil?\n\n& Even if i am trying to make the people around me happy now will i remain emotionally numb forever? will I ever have a truly close friend? Will i remember what happiness feels like? Because i\u2019m so miserable now. & If I do have a personality disorder like I fear, that means i\u2019ll never truly be who i want to be or be able to fulfil my dreams in a way I want to.\n\nI\u2019ll take a note of this book\u2019s title, I want to educate myself more. Thank you for the recommendation, your positivity and all of the motivating words. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmvcb2/im_kind_of_a_bad_person_and_im_really_not_sure/gtww9zx/"}
