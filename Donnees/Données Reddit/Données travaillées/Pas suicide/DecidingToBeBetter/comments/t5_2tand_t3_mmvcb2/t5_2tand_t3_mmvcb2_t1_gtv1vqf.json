The voice in the video repeated affirmations like \u201cI am worthy\u201d and I felt a twinge of sadness because i know that in my mind no matter how many times i repeat that affirmation to myself i won\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m trying to stay optimistic, i wasn\u2019t expecting to be able to meditate properly without any practice anyway. I\u2019m going to try again tomorrow and hope that over time meditation will become useful for me. It works for so many people and is worth a shot \n\nThank you for taking the time to respond today. It gives me some optimism for my future, I hope I can begin to feel less detached from my feelings and my head one day and live a fulfilling life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmvcb2/im_kind_of_a_bad_person_and_im_really_not_sure/gtv1vqf/"}
