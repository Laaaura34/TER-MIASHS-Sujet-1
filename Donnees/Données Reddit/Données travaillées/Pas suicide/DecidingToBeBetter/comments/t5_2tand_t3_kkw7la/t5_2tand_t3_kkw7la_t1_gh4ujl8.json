Or they start and drop out and go back and are on the 5 or 6 year plan. There are also adults who change careers, realizing after a long time they're not in the right spot and they go back to school in their 30s. If you liked broadcasting you should maybe look for classes at your local community college in audio engineering, with online video and podcasting so popular, and really only will go up, you might find that if something you enjoy. But whatever you pick, starting at community college gives you an affordable way to try. they also help you with finding a job because so many people do go back to school through their community college. None of your mistakes are fatal they are just mistakes and everyone makes them. At least you are looking to make a change and to figure out what the next step is. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kkw7la/i_just_turned_27m_today_i_still_live_with_my/gh4ujl8/"}
