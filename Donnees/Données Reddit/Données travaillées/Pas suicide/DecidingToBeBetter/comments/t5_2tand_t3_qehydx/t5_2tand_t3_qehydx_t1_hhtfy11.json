Being that you're anxiously attached means that you tend to attract avoidantly attached people which will continue to trigger your fear of abandonment over and over again. The only way to avoid this is by surrounding yourself with securely attached people or who are also actively putting in effort to meet you halfway. You'll lose \"friends\" and might no longer be attracted to the same type of partners which can be REALLY scary at first, but your mental health is more important than staying in relationships with people that continuously hurt you even if it's unintentional. You should do some research on healing codependency, it goes a little deeper than just focusing on attachment styles and might be more helpful. Hope this is useful to you :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qehydx/how_to_overcome_insecure_attachment/hhtfy11/"}
