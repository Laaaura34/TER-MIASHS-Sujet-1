The anxious attachment goes away and comes back. We are on our third break right now and I have understood that some of the problem is my attachment style but also few issues in the relationship. I\u2019m hoping to get back together with a better version of me but I\u2019ve also slowly accepted the fact that its okay if we don\u2019t get back together - its hard at the beginning but my will to to fix myself is stronger because no one else will do it for me. Find yourself hobbies to occupy yourself and clear your head, focus on something else. It\u2019ll take time but its gonna be worth it, I know it. Goodluck. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qehydx/how_to_overcome_insecure_attachment/hhut14a/"}
