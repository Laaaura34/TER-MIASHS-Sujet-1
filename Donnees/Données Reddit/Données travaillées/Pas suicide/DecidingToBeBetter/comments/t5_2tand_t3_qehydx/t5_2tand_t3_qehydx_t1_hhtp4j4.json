Life is like a bus, people get on and off. Most of the time they only ride with you for a couple of stops (maybe they had one class with you in college). Sometimes they will ride with you for a few years (your co-workers), but most people get off the bus eventually, and the bus goes on. It is ok because eventually new people will come on your bus, and one day, you will realize that some people on this bus are riding to the end with you (your parents, close/longterm friends, S.O., etc). Until then, just ride your bus, say hi to the people who come on, say good bye when they get off, and carry on.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: wow, woke up to this.
