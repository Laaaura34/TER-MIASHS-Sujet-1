It can quickly help you figure out your attachment style and then gives suggestions on how to effectively overcome the worst parts and embrace the others.  The biggest advice it gives - you need to be with a securely attached person.  If you try to date someone like us, it'll make things worse.\n\nThat said.  I'm in a 13-year anxious/avoidant relationship, it can work.  It sure works a lot better since we figured out the attachment style bit.  Turns out the fight we've been having for years...  other people have it too...  we're not unique lol.  We're all just replaying what we learned as little kids.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qehydx/how_to_overcome_insecure_attachment/hht8kud/"}
