Therapy helped me figure out where the anger came from for me, and I got an unexpected but in retrospect obvious diagnosis and put on meds that resolve or at least mitigate the root cause(s) of my rage. Plus we work on strategies that help me stay in control during the period of initial reaction until my rational brain can take over from my animal brain and come up with a useful response. Exercise just helps reduce stress and boost mood so my baseline is further away from head butting walls. \n\nYou can also just force yourself to sit with yourself for an hour and think about why you\u2019re angry. For me, the worst is when I feel like I\u2019m not in control of the situation or when events around me seem unjust. I therefore am working on that old standby of seeking to change what I can and accepting what I cannot. \n\nGood luck dude. Anger has to be tamed to maintain good close relationships, so you\u2019ve got your work cut out for you. But it\u2019s work that CAN be done\u2014you\u2019ll be better in the future and your loved ones will appreciate you seeking personal betterment.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kydctv/how_to_deal_with_anger_issues/gjh2c08/"}
