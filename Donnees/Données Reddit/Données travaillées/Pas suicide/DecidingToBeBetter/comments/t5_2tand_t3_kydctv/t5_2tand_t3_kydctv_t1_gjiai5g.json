From then on, make it clear that a line is being crossed just after it has been crossed.\n\nThe conversation might develop as follows:\n\n\u2013 Like this. What I meant is exactly this. Please don\u2019t do that.\n\n\u2013 Oh, come on! I only did this tiny little thing.\n\n\u2013 Yes, you did. And that gave me an opportunity to clarify that that thing is exactly what bothers me.\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t be so delicate. You\u2019re making a big deal of it.\n\n\u2013 Maybe I\u2019m delicate. So please refrain from repeating that. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll refrain from doing things that bother you, even if I don\u2019t understand why. Sounds like a nice and civilized agreement to me.\n\nThe other thing that you can do is catharsis. When you feel you\u2019re near your limit, hit a mattress or a big pillow hard with the palm of your hands. Vent your anger on it for as long as it takes. Afterwards, your thoughts will be clearer, and you will be better prepared to make good decisions.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kydctv/how_to_deal_with_anger_issues/gjiai5g/"}
