You are incredibly strong for having the self-awareness to write this out and admit to yourself that you struggle with addiction. Being addicted to drugs is not something anyone chooses, it's in your brain chemistry, and it's not your fault. It is your responsibility to care for yourself through this difficult time, and it sounds like you are off to a good start. I wish you luck, and let me know if you ever need to talk- my sister struggles with addiction as well and had for the past 15 years, so I've pretty much seen it all. I also have realized recently that I may have substance abuse issues myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oc6xxb/finally_coming_to_terms_with_the_fact_that_im_an/h3t1c9i/"}
