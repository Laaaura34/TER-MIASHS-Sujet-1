I very strongly urge to never take one again. I wouldn\u2019t even want to call them a bandaid because that\u2019s being too generous. They are worse than a bandaid. They cause way more anxiety in the long run than they suppress in the short term. \n\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time on the website benzobuddies.com which is a support group for those who were addicted to benzos and are now going through the hellish withdrawal. I\u2019m not exaggerating here when I\u2019m telling you that benzo withdrawal can mess up your brain chemistry so much that the withdrawal effects can last years. \n\nIt is considered to among the worst withdrawals the human body/mind can ever go through. \nIt can cause LIFELONG issues with suicidal levels of horrific anxiety, depersonalization/derealization (which I\u2019ve had and it\u2019s hell) brain zaps, physical pain, suicidal thoughts, terrible depression etc.\nThe list of symptoms vary from person to person. Some have a few some have a lot. For some withdrawal lasts a few weeks, for some, years. That\u2019s what makes it so notorious. \n\nI urge you to check out benzobuddies.com and read the horror stories to scare you straight. Wether you have anxiety or just take them for fun please find another way to get your anxiety under control (meditation, therapy, exercise, CBT/DBT, etc).\n\nEdit: Also I\u2019d like to point out that you said you had a benzo overdose. Blacking out for three days to a week isn\u2019t considered an overdose for benzos. That\u2019s most certainly abuse of the drug but not an overdose. Unless breathing becomes difficult, your fingers and lips turned blue or your in a coma and doctors have to administer live saving drugs and treatment to save your life then you didn\u2019t overdose. The LD50 for a benzodiazepine is actually extremely high. Now if you mixed a benzo with another drug thats where things get life threatening extremely fast.
