If you had a stomache ache from eating a bunch of bad carrots, it wouldn't be strange to suggest you have a bit of ginger. Is it inherently bad to suggest that he eat some different roots to cure his tummy ache from eating too many other roots?\n\nEven the guy who created the 12 step program felt that his experiences were overwhelmingly positive and that substances like lsd held tremendous potential for the treatment of addiction. We now happen to live in a time where research on psychedelics substances and their efficacy in treating a whole gang of different issues ranging from depression to addiction (and more) is being researched and all of the data support the above sentiment.\n\nA responsible person will do the research and can make that decision for themselves.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oc6xxb/finally_coming_to_terms_with_the_fact_that_im_an/h4d9zfe/"}
