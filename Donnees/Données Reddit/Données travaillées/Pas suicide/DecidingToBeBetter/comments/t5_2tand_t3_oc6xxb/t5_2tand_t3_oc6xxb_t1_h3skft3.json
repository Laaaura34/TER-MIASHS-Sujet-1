Addiction has nothing whatsoever to do with education or intellect. Doctors, lawyers, scientists, college professors, etc., have just as high an incidence of substance addiction as any other group, if not even higher. The reason the distinction is crucial is because attributing it to lack of intelligence provides a ready-made excuse for relapse (\u201cwell, I\u2019m too dumb to figure out how to stop, so I may as well continue to use\u2026\u201d)\n\nAddiction is *generally* the result of an unfortunate combination of innate personality along with traumatic and/or unstable early childhood environment and it\u2019s impact on neurochemistry.

The important points are: 1) it is not your fault; 2) it is not a moral failing; 3) it is not a simple matter of willpower; 4) as stated, it\u2019s not a matter of intelligence or education; 5) there are ways to successfully live with the condition; and, perhaps most important, 6) you\u2019ve recognized and admitted it. \n\nThere are several subs dedicated to recovery and several modalities ranging from strictly scientific (e.g., psychiatric/psychological individual and/or group therapy and SMART Recovery) to spiritual (12-step groups like NA and specific-faith based groups). \n\nBest of luck to you!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oc6xxb/finally_coming_to_terms_with_the_fact_that_im_an/h3skft3/"}
