Like you need to be a bit more magnanimous. Like round things off to the nearest dollar instead of counting cents, metaphorically speaking.\n\nIt\u2019s just that personal relationships are not an accounting spreadsheet. When you\u2019re too calculating, it turns away potential friends and mates.\n\nDW I used to be like you and I super regret it now. Trust me. I regret it so much. I ruined a lot of personal relations that were important to me coz I feel I went overboard and alienated people who cared and had genuine feelings for me. I hurt them. Now I\u2019m paying the price.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ftb1/noticed_that_alot_of_my_romantic_relationships/hibgctu/"}
