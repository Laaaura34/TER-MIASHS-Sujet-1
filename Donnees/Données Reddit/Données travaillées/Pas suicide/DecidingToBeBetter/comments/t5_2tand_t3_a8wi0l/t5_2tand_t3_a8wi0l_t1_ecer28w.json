You\u2019re definitely not alone. Was nice to read something that hit so close to home. Im not sure of my own advice since I feel similarly but, I have been exploring random hobbies that have been brought to my attention by friends, people, or self discovery. For example, I started doing indoor rock climbing for 6 months just to have a new outlet with a different crowd of people. I\u2019m trying out music production now. To me it feels like a good way to improve while distracting myself from negative thoughts. You could end up being a workaholic though which I know too well and that\u2019s not good either. Try googling hobbies and try something new you haven\u2019t thought about before (YouTube tutorials help for sure). Maybe some kind of instrument if that sounds fun to you. Good luck with the year!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8wi0l/im_done/ecer28w/"}
