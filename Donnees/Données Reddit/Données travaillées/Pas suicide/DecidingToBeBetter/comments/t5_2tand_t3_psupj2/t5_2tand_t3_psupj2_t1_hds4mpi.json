I'm working on that now. I do it during the week because I'm busy working and have less time to focus on smoking. (Not going to lie, I'm struggling...day 2 here). I try to plan, what I will do when I get out of work to keep myself busy.   Working Out? I try to start on a weekend because I have more time. Walk in the a.m., run errands, gym in the afternoon. When Monday rolls around, I tell myself I'm half way there & have 2 days under my belt. Keep going. (With the working out)..\n You really have to change your \"self talk\". It takes a while but tell yourself your worth it everyday. Try to change your negative talk. Don't give up on yourself!! Keep trying. That's half your battle. Fall off the wagon? Get back on it. You can do this!! Good luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psupj2/i_am_sick_of_myself/hds4mpi/"}
