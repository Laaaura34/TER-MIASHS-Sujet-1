I'm beginning to lose sight on what I really want from life and to be honest I feel like it's killing me. I wish I had some great advice seeing how I'm 27, but I'm afraid I don't have much to offer. I do however believe that since you're feeling and thinking this way, that you have a great chance of being what and who you truly want to be. You said you're moving soon so I'm sure it'll still be rough for awhile, but after reading your post I have no doubt that you've got the mindset it takes to keep climbing. Cheers yo and best of luck on your journey", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iueqop/need_help_to_grow_up_and_do_better_for_myself/g5kcjkn/"}
