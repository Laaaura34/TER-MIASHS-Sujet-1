So what I do is set timers on Instagram and reddit. I do 15 minutes Instagram and 45 mins reddit. So an hour a day of social media shit. When those minutes run out, I find myself looking up news or reading blogs but at leat those things are productive and eventually you catch up on that stuff and get bored so go live life lol. The main thing keeping me on my phone is texting back my bf or family/friends. \n\nI understand your pain as I'm trying to stay off my phone so much too. But 10 to 15 hours is so extreme! Do you work? If so, build the habit of actually working and staying focused and keeping off your phone so much. I've started using a planner to write out all the tasks I need to complete for school, work, life, etc. It's helped out a lot on at least reminding me of what I need to get done and motivates me to stick to plan. So in order to do those things I gotta be off my phone. My advice is set the timers for like 25 mins per app to start. Once the max has been reached, you are done til the next day!  Another thing that helped me was looking up on Google how to stop being on phone so much. Kinda like you're doing here lol. So at least you recognize the problem. I think with a little discipline, you can conquer the addiction to social media and start enjoying life more.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pd2n3z/social_media_is_taking_over_my_life/han8gju/"}
