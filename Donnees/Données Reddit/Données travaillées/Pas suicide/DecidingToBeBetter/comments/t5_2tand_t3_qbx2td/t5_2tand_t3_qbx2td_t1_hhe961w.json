There's nothing wrong with living an average, unremarkable life.  The key is to identify some things that really do matter to you - prioritize those and have passion for them.  But those things don't have to be what other people or society tell you you should prioritize.\n\nFor example, work.  There are two good options for work.  1: find a job that you're really passionate about, and don't worry if it takes up a lot of your time and doesn't pay much.  You won't need too much fulfillment from other sources because you're getting it from work.  2: find a job that's good enough (in terms of pay and how much you like it), do the minimum required of that job, and use it to enjoy your non-work time.\n\nSo basically, don't base your identity on your job or spend any extra time or effort on it unless it's the thing you're passionate about.  There's nothing wrong with putting in the minimum required effort to collect a paycheck so that you can enjoy the rest of your life.  Just make sure you have something that gets you going, and ignore what society thinks about it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhe961w/"}
