In my case, believe part of it is because I have an 'all or nothing mentality' and I struggle with perfectionism. If I believe that something that I want to do isn't going to be perfect, I'm tempted to spend less time on it and distance myself from what I have to do to 'protect me from failure'. In my mind the excuse is: \"well, it's bad because I didn't put any effort into it, not because I'm dumb\".  \nYet life doesn't work like that, and I find myself unmotivated and avoiding anything that can be a disappointment by playing videogames and not stepping out of my comfort zone. I'm going to therapy to work on that though.  \n\n\nPS: I don't think that I have ADHD but I find everything that people online say about it relatable.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhclohd/"}
