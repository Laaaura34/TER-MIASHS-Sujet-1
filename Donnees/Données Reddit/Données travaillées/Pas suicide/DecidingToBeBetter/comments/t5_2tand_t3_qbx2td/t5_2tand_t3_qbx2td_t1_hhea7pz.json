Like a list of things you\u2019d like to accomplish by a 25. By 30. By 35+? \n\nI was in an eerily similar place to you, no thanks to my addictive smoking drinking and other hedonistic habits. I still fall to my own desires some days. We\u2019re human.\n\nHaving a physical reference to visualize what you value and want from life will help you organize the steps needed to get there.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to have your life figured out, most people don\u2019t, but without a direction a lot of life can seem overwhelmingly pointless (except for pleasure). \nFor example, you\u2019re interested in writing a book. Some of the best authors take years to write their \u2018worst\u2019 books. As the saying goes, Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. \nHowever, knowing this, you can include writing (simply for the sake of writing) as one of the things you do everyday. \n\nNo athlete became a pro practicing his/her craft once a month.\n\nLike many have said already, your daily habits will be what builds your future.

The little things add up over time. Soon enough, you\u2019ll look back and go \u201cwow a year ago I was such a noob at this\u201d \n\nTime is valuable and you choose how you spend it, the only person who can stop you from living the lifestyle you want is you. Whether you have ADHD or are lazy (not saying you are) or lack ambition is HIGHLY IRRELEVANT when it comes to the choices you decide to consistently make. \n\nBasically, it\u2019s on you to decide choosing delayed gratification, or the less easy path, over easily attainable pleasures like watching a season of a show in a day (as I\u2019m currently doing while studying)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhea7pz/"}
