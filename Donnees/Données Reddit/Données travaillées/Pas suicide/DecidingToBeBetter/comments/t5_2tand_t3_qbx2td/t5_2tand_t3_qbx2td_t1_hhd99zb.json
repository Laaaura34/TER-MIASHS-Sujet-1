I was lazy asf, getting baked all day and my GPA was horrendous. I still got my degree, but it ended up fucking with my mindset and drive. \n\nFast forward 2 in a half years to now, I got a really good job and I am about to close on my house. I figured out that I was cutting corners and not working hard, and the universe was giving me back what I deserved. Once I shifted my mindset, everything changed. When you do the right thing and work hard, good karma will always find your way. It is not too late to change your lifestyle, but also I do not blame you for falling into that. It is so easy to establish bad habits in college lol", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhd99zb/"}
