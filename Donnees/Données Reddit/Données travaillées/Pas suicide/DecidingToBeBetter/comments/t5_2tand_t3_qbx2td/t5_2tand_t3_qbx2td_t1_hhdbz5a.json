It can help to focus on what you enjoy about the process intrinsically, and not worry too much about the end result. At the end of the day all you really need is enough money to live and retire, and whatever basic needs that you can\u2019t get with money alone.\n\nI also second the notion of using a routine. Doing a lot of the \u201cgoals\u201d you suggested takes a lot of mental energy that isn\u2019t always apparent when you think about it in the abstract. For example, trying to shift your life to becoming a doctor or big time writer is a big deal\u2026 Then, deciding to oscillate between goals can take even more of energy! Making daily work towards those goals that you do decide part of your routine as well as other decisions that take a lot of energy (spend time identifying those whether it\u2019s gym, cooking, whatever) can help free up your mind.  \n\nAt the end of the day, all these decisions are suboptimal\u2026 there\u2019s always a reason to not go down a particular path. You should just focus on what you enjoy the most or whatever you value or need the most, and stick to that.  Then you can adjust when the time comes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhdbz5a/"}
