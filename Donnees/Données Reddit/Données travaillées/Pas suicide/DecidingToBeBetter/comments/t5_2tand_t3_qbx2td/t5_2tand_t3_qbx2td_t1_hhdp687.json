It's sort of like the movie, \"Field of Dreams\" where they said, \"Build it and they will come\".  Just do it.  You can still be lazy.  I am.  I've been lazy all my life, but I also have many interests which I cycle back and forth.  So, I will write, I will pontificate in my journals, I will post the funny stuff online.  I will make dolls, crochet, sew face masks, mend stuff, bake stuff, watch YouTube videos to learn stuff.  I read constantly; all sorts of stuff.  \n\nI went to 13 different schools in 12 years and did not have a stellar academic career.  I flunked out of college in the first year.  Got a job, not a career, was happy enough paying the rent and putting bread on the table.  Turned psychic at 35 years old.  Never had a new car.  Never bought a house and I'm retired now.  Am I happy?  You bet I am.  Am I famous?  No.  Do I want to be famous?  No.  I'm good.  \n\nMy advice would be to start writing.  Don't show it to anybody.  Just stand on your soapbox and pontificate.  Eventually, you will have done whatever healing you need to do and will get on with your life.  One word of advice is that nobody can make you happy.  You are in charge of that one.  Best of luck.  I'm sure you will go far.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhdp687/"}
