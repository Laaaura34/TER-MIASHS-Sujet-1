I saw one of my favorite comments on reddit a couple days ago. It says:  \n\n\n*\"I find peace in knowing I don\u2019t need to fulfill any crazy purpose or goal beyond simply existing.*\n\n*I try to just live each day showing compassion and love. That\u2019s all I need at the end to feel accomplished. I don\u2019t need to be anything more than I am and the joy I give to others.*  \n\n\n*I know it\u2019s easier said than done, but you have so much value and worth without that purpose. Without that goal. You are perfect in the sense that you just ARE.\"*  \n\n\nJust something to chew on. Remember that regardless of what you accomplish, you will always need more. Becoming at peace with your mind and holding onto that regardless of external circumstance is where true satisfaction lies.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhehb0r/"}
