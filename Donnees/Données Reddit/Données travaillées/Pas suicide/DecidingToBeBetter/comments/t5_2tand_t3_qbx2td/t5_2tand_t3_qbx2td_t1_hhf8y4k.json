Also as much as ADHD is a pain in the ass it has a veeery wide spectrum of symptoms and some people are less affected, and some of its weird quirks are beneficial (like hyperfocusing and also being good at seeing systems/coming up with ideas). Symptoms can change over your life and get better or worse. Many ppl find cannabis helps immensely (my spouse is one), others really need stimulants (my spouse\u2019s therapist said that in her experience as an ADHD specialist, people tend to respond a lot better to one or the other!). It\u2019s a really weird brain thing but if you can get a handle on it it might answer a lot of your problems:)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhf8y4k/"}
