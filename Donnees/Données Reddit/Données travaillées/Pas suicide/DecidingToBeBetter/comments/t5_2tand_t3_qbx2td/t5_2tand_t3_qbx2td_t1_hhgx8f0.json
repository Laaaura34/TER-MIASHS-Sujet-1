For me, it explains so so so much and if the meds work for you (without giving you strong upper effects like they do to people without adhd) then they often REALLY work. No shame in balancing out something that\u2019s out of whack, like too-low norepinephrine levels. Good luck!!!! If you go that route and want to help yourself before the diagnosis comes through, exercise has been shown to improve ADHD symptoms\u2014it releases dopamine among other things and norepinephrine is synthesised from dopamine. I always felt amazing and happy after a good workout, a \u201chigh \u201c that my boyfriend never gets. Then I\u2019m much more clear headed afterwards.
