Playing countless hours of team fortress and watching anime all night. I did graduate college, get my career, start my business endeavors, get the girl, etc. All with varying levels of success and longevity. Some things did work out, some didn\u2019t. And not every circumstance was under my control. But everything came when the moment was right.\n\nI\u2019m now 30, loving my job and work harder now than I ever have. I exercise regularly and have a healthy social circle. I barely play video games or watch TV anymore. It\u2019s all second nature. I even quit smoking, drinking, and binge eating.\n\nSome things do get better with time. As you get older you\u2019ll be better at making long term goals and you\u2019ll meet more people and find your true motivations.\n\nThe only thing I would really really advise you do NOW is start saving for a home for when you\u2019re 30/35. Stash as much money as you can in a stable ETF. I\u2019m talking $400-500 a month. You\u2019ll turn $50,000 into at least $70-80,000 after taxes from compound returns. And don\u2019t touch it for ten years. I know this sounds crazy but the time will fly faster than you expect and you\u2019ll be thanking me when you have enough cash to own a home while your like aged peers are struggling to pay their mortgage or are homeless.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hheywob/"}
