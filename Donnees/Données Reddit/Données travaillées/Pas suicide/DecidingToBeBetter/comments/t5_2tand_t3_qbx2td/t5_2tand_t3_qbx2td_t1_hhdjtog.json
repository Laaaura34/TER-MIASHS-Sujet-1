All my friends are busy with internship, competition, etc but same old me is doing nothing wasting life. \n\nI feel insecure if they asked how was your week, cz i literally do nothing. So i started journaling last week but i didn't continue. Now I'm trying to write more and hopefully earn some pocket money from the essay comp i joined lmao.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhdjtog/"}
