And to add to other comments, I have depression and ADHD and a lot of stuff you\u2019re saying is familiar. **Please speak to a doctor!**   \nIt can seem like a big task, but break down the steps (find GP\u2019s phone number, write out what to say to receptionist, phone at 8am\u2026). This could be really important!  \n\nThough having a break isn\u2019t super realistic (life is annoyingly unrelenting) maybe try and **\u201dreset\u201d how you\u2019re thinking about life or going about day-to-day stuff.**\n\nLike, make new year\u2019s resolutions, but start them next week. Or, what advice would you give to a friend in a similar situation? \n\nYou might benefit from more rigid **goal setting/deadlines/schedules**.  \n*E.g. for my 9am Thursday class I will do any preparatory work on Wednesday from 3-4pm in the caf\u00e9 opposite my house, and I will set out a note-taking template for the class.*\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re not very excited about what you\u2019re doing at school. **Think about why you chose this subject** - something must have grabbed you!   \nI like to listen to podcasts or popular science books about my subject, or tangentially related subjects - this gets me excited about what I\u2019m studying! (well, sometimes - I will always hate certain aspects\u2026)\n\nAdding in **healthy habits** can also help (exercise and good food).  \n*E.g. Walk for 15 mins first thing in the morning, do 10 mins of a yoga video before bed, find an obscure exercise class you always wanted to try. Make a meal plan, try a new recipe to make each week and take turns cooking for your housemates.*\n\nStart a new **hobby**, or revive an old one.  \n*E.g. Join a language class or club at university.* \nSometimes goal setting or forming habits can be useful even with fun stuff - *\u201dI will write for 10 minutes after breakfast on weekdays\u201d.*", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhgtxne/"}
