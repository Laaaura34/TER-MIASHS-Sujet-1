I ended up psychiatrically hospitalized back in April for my Depression, and spent a week without my phone, which was difficult at first, but once I got out, I realized how much time I wasted on Social Media/my screen in general, and how bad I always felt after. I haven't deleted the apps entirely, since people will occasionally use Facebook or Insta to get ahold of me with the message features, but I don't really open them up at all anymore outside of rare circumstances. I haven't posted or scrolled through Twitter since April, and I honestly feel better for it. The only part that bothers me is that Social Media was really my only connection to a lot of long distance friends, and I hate feeling like I've dropped out of their lives entirely.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ptuhun/150_days_without_social_media_7_things_i_noticed/he2ynd0/"}
