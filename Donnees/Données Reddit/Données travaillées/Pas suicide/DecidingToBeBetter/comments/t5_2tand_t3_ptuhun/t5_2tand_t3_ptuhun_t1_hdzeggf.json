I quit Facebook and Instagram 3 years ago because a cousin of mine committed suicide and instead of family calling each other over the phone and making sure all the families were informed, some family members posted hearts all over Facebook on my newsfeed and said \"RIP...\" I wasn't sure what was going on and nobody would call me on the phone. It wasn't until later on at night that I found out what exactly happened. I didn't like finding out about a close family member's suicide through frivolous Facebook posts all over my news feed. \n\nI told them never again will I find out a family member's death via social media. Just fucking text me if it's hard to call me over the phone and tell me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ptuhun/150_days_without_social_media_7_things_i_noticed/hdzeggf/"}
