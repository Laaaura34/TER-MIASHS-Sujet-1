I don't have: FB, IG, Twitter, Snap, whatever. Even Reddit is not important to me. It could go bye-bye tomorrow and I won't even blink twice.\n\nI much more prefer hiking, cycling, running, boating, fishing, golf...anything outside. \n\nSadly, I now see people on their phones while....fishing. How SAD is that?\n\nIt irritates me how attached my wife it to Tic Toc...and everyone else. It's like I'm the only one aware of my surroundings.
