I quit Facebook four years ago and have never looked back. I tell everyone it's one of the best things I've ever done. Yes I am completely out of the loop, but I don't mind because I also don't get the BS and that's a trade off I'm more than happy with.\n\nI also joined in 2007 when it was a massive novelty. When I quite FB, Instagram was more like an online photo album (how it used to be) and I was traveling a lot at the time so I stayed on there so I could add picture of my travels - then when Instagram gradually morphed into Facebook 2.0 after the acquisition, I started having the same feelings as FB, so I left that almost 2 years ago.\n\nI am a million times happier. - I don't know how people are still one there. I second the thought; life is a gift for you to enjoy. It doesn't matter what other people are doing, there are a million different ways to live your life and be happy doing your own 'lil thing. \n\nI might start using Instagram again one day as a private photo album for me with the following caveats: 1) I won't follow anyone 2) I won't let anyone follow me (private account)\n\nLife without social media is soooo much better!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ptuhun/150_days_without_social_media_7_things_i_noticed/he2s7mi/"}
