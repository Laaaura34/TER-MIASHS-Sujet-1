Personally I like the taste much better, it has less caffeine, and the caffeine has a smoother curve. \n\nI noticed that sometimes coffee made me jittery because all the caffeine hit too fast. So I switched to Yerba mate, a super highly caffeinated tea, the matcha,  and since quarantine started I\u2019m down to normal black tea, usually 2 cups a day. \n\nThe more caffeine you drink, the less effective it is and the more tired you are when you don\u2019t have it. \n\nI also recommend exercise, stretching, reading before bed (with low light), avoiding electronic light before bed as much as possible, and committing to a steady sleep schedule. Also don\u2019t eat too soon before bed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hw3x7b/always_tired_except_when_i_actually_want_to_go_to/fyxyjbh/"}
