I like it. You do have a good point. Hardly anybody has said anything about the escorting aspect except for OneWifeSoFar who is concerned that I'm using sex to feel better.\n\nI don't think it's a big deal to escort. It's great money and fairly safe. I work for an agency who would take almost all the blame in a sting and the owner screens clients like the FBI. Every client I've had is extremely respectful of my boundaries and time. I only mentioned escorting to emphasize that money isn't an issue.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4j4ih2/hate_my_job_escorting_on_the_side_so_i_can_move/d34derp/"}
