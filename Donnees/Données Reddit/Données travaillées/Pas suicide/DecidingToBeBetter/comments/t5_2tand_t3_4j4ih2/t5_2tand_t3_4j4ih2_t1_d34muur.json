I do understand that many people go into sex work for the wrong reasons. I considered it for many years. In fact, I wish I had started earlier. It's incredibly empowering. I've only been doing it for about 3-4 weeks and I've already met the most amazing people. They offer amazing life advice, perspective, and encouragement. And many of them were FANTASTIC lays.\n\nI mentioned it in my post because I want to emphasize that money\u2014for the first time in my entire life\u2014is not a problem. I'm a frugal person by nature so escorting for just a few days one week pays for all of my expenses for the entire month. It's pretty great actually.\n\nI took the job that I have now because of money problems. I settled. It was the first offer so I took it. The job itself is.... okay but the company and lifestyle there is incredibly dreary.\n\n\n\nSo, to recap my original post\u2014I'm trying to find my purpose.
