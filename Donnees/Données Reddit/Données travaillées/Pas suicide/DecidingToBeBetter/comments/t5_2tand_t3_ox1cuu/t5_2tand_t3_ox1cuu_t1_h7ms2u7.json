Just with the antidepressants tho, I'm not sure if this is the same with everyone else, but I had a week of being productive (after a breakdown) before I started taking meds, cuz I wanted to keep the momentum going too, and as soon as I started antidepressants I felt worse for the first week. I'm not against you taking them at all, but I just wanted to warn you that you might feel a lot worse before you start feeling better on meds. I didn't realise this and it was really discouraging with the progress I made too, and I kind of wish someone told me they wouldn't work instantly. But yeah, I'm not discouraging you, I just thought you should know this so you don't feel as discouraged when you start them. I hope everything goes well!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox1cuu/im_trying_my_hardest_guys/h7ms2u7/"}
