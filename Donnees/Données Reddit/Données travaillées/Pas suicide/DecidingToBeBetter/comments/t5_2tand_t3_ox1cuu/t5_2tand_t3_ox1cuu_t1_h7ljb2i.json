This post was just about me wanting to share the progress I\u2019ve made and where I\u2019m at in life. What to do for a career has been a question I\u2019ve struggled with a great deal and I think I\u2019ve decided once I\u2019m stable and well I\u2019ll attend university to study psychology to become therapist. I miss spoke before but psychologist is an option too. \n\nI don\u2019t want to follow this path simply because I want to help people to be honest that\u2019s mostly an afterthought. My main motivation is I find the field interesting and I think my skills match up well with the job. It ticks most of my boxes for what I want in a job and because I have great listening skills, ect, I should be able to help people which is nice. \n\nI do understand how important it is to recognise if you are able to help someone or not, hell I posted a reply to someone earlier that was asking for life help and my advice was to see a therapist because none of us will be able to help them like they could.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox1cuu/im_trying_my_hardest_guys/h7ljb2i/"}
