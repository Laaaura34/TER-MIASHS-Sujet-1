The power of positive habits. Small consistent steps was a huge game changer for me. It started with this speech by a navy admiral (I can't recall his name) called \"Just make the bed.\" \n\nBasically he says the very first thing you do in the morning is immediately get up and make your bed. You start out on the right foot immediately accomplishing a task. After a couple weeks it was harder for to me leave my room in the morning without making my bed lol. That really woke me up to the power of positive habits. Started adapting that mentality to everything.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pupcph/this_post_by_a_random_internet_stranger_has_been/he8ni8g/"}
