I need to print it out and tape it to every mirror and door in my house. I've read and heard some variation of this a bunch of times and it always gives me that feeling of hope that changes my whole day.\n\nBut that's the problem, I always get to a point whether it's a week later or an hour later that I just slide right back into feeling sorry for myself and consciously choosing that temporary comfort over the long term self respect.\n\nBut that's for me to overcome, and things like this are what I need drilled into my head. Thanks again for posting this here.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pupcph/this_post_by_a_random_internet_stranger_has_been/he6beyx/"}
