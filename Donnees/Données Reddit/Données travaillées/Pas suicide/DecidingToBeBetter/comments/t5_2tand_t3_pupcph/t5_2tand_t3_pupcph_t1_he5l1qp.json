None of this matters and there's only two choices after having this realisation. To end or continue living. But once you come face to face with this realisation it sets you free in a beautiful way. You're no longer afraid of death nor life. I am not religious but I also don't understand what happens after death. My guess is that either you're reborn or it's and eternity of nothingness. If it's the later, I'd be really happy but if it's the prior, I'd rather chose to keep on living in my present circumstances rather than being reborn into a shittier life. I would rather make the most out of the cards I've been dealt with than risk taking a new hand.\n\nI had a serious phase of existential dread and I hope no one experiences what I went through. Now I'm better and I treat life like a video game, for the lack of a better word. I set seemingly arbitrary goals which are personally meaningful to me. I take care and love the people around me. I chase good experiences and test my physical and mental potential. Realising that life has no meaning should not be an end but only a new beginning. Of freedom. Of individual meaning and stress-free living. \n\nI know none of this would be appealing to you if you're in a different psychological state but trust me it gets better from here. You've reached a liberating conclusion which many people who are plugged into the matrix don't reach.
