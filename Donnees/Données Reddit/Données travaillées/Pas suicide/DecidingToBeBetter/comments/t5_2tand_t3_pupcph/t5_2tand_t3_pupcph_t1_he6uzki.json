It's been an ongoing issue for me, regardless of opportunities given otherwise. Oh, your friend wants you to work on some music video for his music? I just end up not knowing where to start or how to go about it without being overwhelmed even with a storyboard. What about making that game you wanted to make? Lol should have deved those years ago huh? Or what about that art you said you'd make? Or what about that music? Oh yeah, remember that twitch stream? Just every day myself waking up to it just being another day I 'wasted' makes me want to do better, but I just dunno. Everything feels so 'boring'. I wish I was interested in doing things like making music or art or videos like others are.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pupcph/this_post_by_a_random_internet_stranger_has_been/he6uzki/"}
