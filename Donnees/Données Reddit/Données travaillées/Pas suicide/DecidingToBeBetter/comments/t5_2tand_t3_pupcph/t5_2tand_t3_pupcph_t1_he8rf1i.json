I cant talk about this stuff out loud with anyone but my therapist at the moment... but if any good can come from my own suffering, its that I can understand other people's and maybe be a better friend when Im strong again. I know how precious even a drop of hope can be when youre in the true darkness. Im happy to have help kindle some in you.
