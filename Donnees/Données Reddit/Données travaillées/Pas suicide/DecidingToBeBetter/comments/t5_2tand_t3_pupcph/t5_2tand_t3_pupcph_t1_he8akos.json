The natural state of animals, humans, living organisms, the universe itself, is decay. Slowly, the sun will burn out. Some galaxies will collide but will inevitably move further and further apart. If you put the car that is your life in park you may think you are just pushing pause and stopping things for a while. Maybe it feels that way for a moment but the world keeps turning. People keep changing. The sun keeps burning. The universe keeps expanding to its eventual heat death. \n\nEntropy is universally guaranteed, but for this one blip on the radar that is your life, you can create something. You can change how the universe dies it\u2019s slow and eventual death. \n\nHopefully this is useful for someone else and isn\u2019t just me reminding myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pupcph/this_post_by_a_random_internet_stranger_has_been/he8akos/"}
