It felt strange and difficult in the beggining but slowy started to feel natural and I was able to express better, but not ideally. I've been strugling with axienty problems andit, obviously, interferred in my social expression. And to improve this I started to play guitar. Being able to play a musical instrument improves your confidence when talking to others, for what ever reason. Plus I believe that meditating and doing the Wim Hof method can help you control your thoughts doing a chat, providing a better quality conversation which is able to make you feel confortable when around other people, thus making you not thrilled to be indeed your inner self in public.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hl0a9x/youve_got_to_free_yourself_from_your_emotional/fwwt0v1/"}
