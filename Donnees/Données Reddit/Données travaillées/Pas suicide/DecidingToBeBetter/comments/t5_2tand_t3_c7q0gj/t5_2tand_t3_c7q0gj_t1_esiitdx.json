I\u2019m in AA and the med alone wouldn\u2019t have been enough to keep me sober- it actually still took enormous strength to not drink on it, and I couldn\u2019t do it on my first try- so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s enough for people to take that and not do anything else? Maybe for some people it is, but it seems unlikely to me given the strength of alcohol cravings\n\nI know in other parts of the world they\u2019re experimenting with that med in very high doses combined with having people drink while on Antabuse a few times which in the clinic so they don\u2019t die but get a very deep aversion to booze (hopefully). And then there\u2019s Ayahuasca. Hopefully at some point there\u2019s enough viable options that people can choose what feels right rather than needing to grasp at what they whatever can get.\n\nAlso though, it\u2019s incredibly important that AA is free... healthcare is impossible or difficult for a lot of people to access, especially for marginalized groups including addicts", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c7q0gj/im_going_to_my_first_aa_meeting_tomorrow/esiitdx/"}
