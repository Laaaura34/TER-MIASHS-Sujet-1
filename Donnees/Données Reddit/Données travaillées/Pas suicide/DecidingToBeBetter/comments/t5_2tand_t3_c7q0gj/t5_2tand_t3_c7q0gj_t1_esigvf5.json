If you get the shakes, please please go to detox! It\u2019ll only take 3-4 days-ish, but alcohol is one of the few drugs from which withdrawal can kill you. You can go to your nearest ER, and they\u2019ll be able to start the detox process (most likely give you your first dose or two of Librium) and then find a detox for you stay at.\n\nThe only thing I\u2019d add that maybe wasn\u2019t said exactly is to take what you want and leave the rest (yep that\u2019s a slogan lol), but my interpretation of that is that the program is different for everyone- some people are very dogmatic, others have stayed sober and lived happy lives for years/decades without doing the steps (heresy!), some people like doing Step work really slowly and cohesively and doing it over and over in their recovery, some people (like my sponsor and I) feel like you should basically just get it done thoroughly ASAP and you\u2019re good to go with just spot-checking here and there.  Some people will actually mention Jesus (or so I\u2019ve heard, my area wouldn\u2019t really be cool with that) and there are meetings specifically for atheists.\n\nANYWAYS, my biggest advice is just keep showing up and if someone says something stupid, ignore them, you\u2019ll be able to find your niche even if it\u2019s not like your long-lost brethren; I basically only talk to my sponsor outside meetings and he\u2019s pretty much the same. People know our face at our home groups and we know theirs, and they\u2019ll be there if we\u2019re in trouble and we\u2019ll be there for them. I also got sober in a group basically exclusively made up of 65+ y.o. men with decades of sobriety and felt out-of-place in the gay and young people\u2019s meetings where I theoretically should\u2019ve fit in better.\n\nBut yeah, it\u2019s a good place to be. Trust what feels right and healthy to you. And congrats on stopping drinking!! You got this!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c7q0gj/im_going_to_my_first_aa_meeting_tomorrow/esigvf5/"}
