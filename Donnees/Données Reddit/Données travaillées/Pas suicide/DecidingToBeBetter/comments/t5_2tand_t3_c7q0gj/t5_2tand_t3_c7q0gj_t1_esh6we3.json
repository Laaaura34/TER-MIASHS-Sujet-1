I remember coming to the realization that ANY social situation required alcohol usage to feel safe or complete or competent. Then it was a salve to soothe boredom and loneliness. My dad was an alcoholic, so were my brothers. Scared me right into those AA rooms. I couldn\u2019t believe I had to identify as an alcoholic - not me. No blackouts, no DUIs, no missed work, no interventions. But I saw and I knew. I\u2019ve now been sober for over 20 years. The crucial precept I learned is that I am powerless over anything that helps me feel at ease. One drink is calming? Four or five must be GREAT. In AA, you\u2019ll find a lot of real people who have had to or wanted to take a hard look at themselves - so refreshing. \n\nYou\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019ll be fine. Work hard, stay honest, be fearless. DM me if you need more input. \n\nPeace.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c7q0gj/im_going_to_my_first_aa_meeting_tomorrow/esh6we3/"}
