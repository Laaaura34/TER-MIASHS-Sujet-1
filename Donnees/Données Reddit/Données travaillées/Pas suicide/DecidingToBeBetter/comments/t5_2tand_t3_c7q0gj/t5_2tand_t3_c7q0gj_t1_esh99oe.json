It\u2019s great that you have self awareness. I\u2019ve never done AA but have done group therapy before so I understand how anxiety ridden you must be. I promise it will go better than you think.

Stay kind to yourself my friend and stay safe!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c7q0gj/im_going_to_my_first_aa_meeting_tomorrow/esh99oe/"}
