I would add only that AA pushes the message that total abstinence is the only way to go.  In reality, there are benefits to cutting down one's drinking - drastic reductions in mortality rates and whatnot.  \n\nI drastically reduced my drinking about 2-3 years ago, and quit entirely about a year ago.
