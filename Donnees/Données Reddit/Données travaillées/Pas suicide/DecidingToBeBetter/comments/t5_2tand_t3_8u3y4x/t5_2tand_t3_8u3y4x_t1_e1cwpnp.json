Not many people did that. And this is a good start. Knowing what you want to do and can go after. \n\nAll you have to do is then overcome your mental hindrance and stop blaming yourself. Believe in yourself (I know it is a cliches). It is easier said than done, i know. But you have to do that. Training your brain to believe in what you say takes time and effort also. But there is a way. You can try meditation. It helps not only in reinforcing your mind, but releasing the stress and frustration. \n\nAlso, don't be harsh on yourself. If you think you fail to do this or follow the schedule, you think about how to improve, instead of blaming yourself on how bad you did. This shouldn't be your focus. Look forward, not backward. \n\nCheer up, okay?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8u3y4x/struggling_to_understand_myself/e1cwpnp/"}
