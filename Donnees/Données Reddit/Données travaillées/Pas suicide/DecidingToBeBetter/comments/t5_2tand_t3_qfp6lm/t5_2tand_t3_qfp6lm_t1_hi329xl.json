I also try to do that same in the opposite direction, I try to say positive things about people in my head. I can be judgemental and see people as below me, this is where my negativity comes from and where negative comments spring from. I've brought my unreasonable standards down so it won't always trigger disapproval and try to see the good traits people have, triggering praise. It's like quitting an addiction, the urge comes often but after a long period of resisting negativity, it becomes unlearned. \n\nBe less bothered by the things people do, I'm really looking into why their actions and ways of doing things trigger a reaction from me, it doesn't have to, I'm working on leaning more on humour so when I disapprove off something, I don't stress myself out with disapproval, I laugh it off by making it a joke. It's like the difference between a boss giving someone a raise and firing someone. One is a pleasure, one is a chore. If you make this switch, you will be happier, this is as much for yourself as for others. Just realising it is a big step forward and you will be happier going forward due to all your self awareness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfp6lm/how_to_be_less_negative_especially_about_other/hi329xl/"}
