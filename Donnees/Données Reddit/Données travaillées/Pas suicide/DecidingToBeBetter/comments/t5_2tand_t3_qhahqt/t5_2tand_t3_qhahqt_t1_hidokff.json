I would also reach out to individual professors. Go to their office hours (if those still exist idk I\u2019m older) and have a conversation. Tell them you\u2019re struggling with time management, ask how they would break down and prioritize the tasks and materials needed to succeed in their class. Some teachers will be more helpful than others of course but it\u2019s a good place to start and always good to touch base with them to let them know you\u2019re having difficulty.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qhahqt/university_consuming_my_life_how_do_i_manage_my/hidokff/"}
