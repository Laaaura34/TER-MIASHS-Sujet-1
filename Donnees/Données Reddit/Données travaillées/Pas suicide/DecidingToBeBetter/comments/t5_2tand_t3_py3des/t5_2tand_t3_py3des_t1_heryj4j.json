But not letting those things effect and consume you the way they do today.\n\nFind the things that make you feel powerless and take back your power. Stand up for yourself by refusing to participate in other people's fuckery. When a situation isn't healthy for you, walk away from it.\n\nNot being reactive, but being proactive, is everyone's super power. \n\nLove yourself. Be true to yourself. Respect yourself. Set boundaries and stick to them. And most importantly, forgive yourself for who you were before you knew any better and who you had to be to survive when you were younger.\n\nNoone is as bad as the worst thing they've ever done. Every day is a chance to start over.\n\nYou're not alone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/py3des/what_does_it_mean_to_let_go_and_how_do_you_do_it/heryj4j/"}
