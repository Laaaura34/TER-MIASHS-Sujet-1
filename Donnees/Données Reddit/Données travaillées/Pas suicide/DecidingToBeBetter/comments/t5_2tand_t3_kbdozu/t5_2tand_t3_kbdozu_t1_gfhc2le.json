Instead of thinking \"I want to be as amazing as X person,\" maybe you should start thinking, \"I want to be the best version of myself.\"\n\nIt's up to you to figure out what that \"best version\" looks like... but I bet it's not going to have anything to do with Meghan Markle! Sometimes doing something incredible and being a role model is a lot smaller and quieter than you might think. We're all overshadowed by these big celebrities and icons, but the truth is, 99.99% of us aren't going to be as amazing or inspirational as them. \n\nInstead, you can start by realizing the power of impacting the world in small and meaningful ways. Always work towards being the best version of yourself, not anyone else!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbdozu/i_have_a_lot_of_anxiety_about_my_dreams_coming_to/gfhc2le/"}
