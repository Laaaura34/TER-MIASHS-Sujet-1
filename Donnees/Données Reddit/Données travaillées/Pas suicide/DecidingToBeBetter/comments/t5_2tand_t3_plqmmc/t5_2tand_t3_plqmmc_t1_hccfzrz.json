These are two different events entirely, they merely share a calendar date. You need to mourn this significant event in your life separate from which the date it occurred. You can still have your real and valid feelings about this event while still giving Halloween a chance as its own entity. You don't have to be completely over the divorce in order to celebrate an unrelated event. I would imagine that prior to the divorce, you had some happy Halloweens as a child that deserve to be celebrated and cherished. I hope you have a good holiday and if you need someone to talk to feel free to DM me. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plqmmc/my_parents_divorced_on_halloween_of_2014_this/hccfzrz/"}
