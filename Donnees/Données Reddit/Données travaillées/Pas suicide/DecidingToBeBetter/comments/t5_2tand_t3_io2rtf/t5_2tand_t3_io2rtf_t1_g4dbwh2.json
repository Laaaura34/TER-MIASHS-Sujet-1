What helped me is reminding myself that the craving will pass, and they always do. Each craving you conquer, the next one is further away. I never have cravings for cigarettes anymore, and I am so glad to be on the other side. Be patient with yourself, find things to occupy your time and become fascinated with things or activities, find a new hobby. Visualize how you want to be. These are just a few things that you can do instead of giving into a craving.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4dbwh2/"}
