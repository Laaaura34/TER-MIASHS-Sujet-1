Fixation or other aspects of your thinking can reinforce the emotion/craving, creating a repetitive cycle where you keep coming back to it so it feels like it lasts much longer. If you can manage to relax, and perhaps use some mindfulness or distraction to avoid that cycle, it's rather incredible and encouraging to notice how quickly it goes away. In the beginning (initial weeks and probably months) these cravings will keep popping up throughout the day, but the frequency decreases over time as long as you abstain and don't substitute other addictive behaviors.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4cauzw/"}
