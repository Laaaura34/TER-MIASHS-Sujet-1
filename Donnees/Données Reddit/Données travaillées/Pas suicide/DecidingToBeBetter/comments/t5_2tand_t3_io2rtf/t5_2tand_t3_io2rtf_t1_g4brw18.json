When I quit drinking I couldn\u2019t sit out on my deck for a few weeks because that\u2019s how I\u2019d spend my evenings before, sitting outside sipping wine. I changed it up. After work I go for a run, hike or to the gym. Make dinner, prep for tomorrow then do some reading. I alternate between fiction and some sort of self improvement book. \n\nExercise is huge help in overcoming addiction, the endorphins released really help the cravings. And reading is a great way to occupy your mind especially in the early days where you\u2019re constantly thinking about your old vices. \n\nA great book I recommend is This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. It\u2019s about overcoming alcohol addiction but you can apply the science to other addictions as well. It really helped me understand the science of addiction which helps me a lot more that pure willpower.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4brw18/"}
