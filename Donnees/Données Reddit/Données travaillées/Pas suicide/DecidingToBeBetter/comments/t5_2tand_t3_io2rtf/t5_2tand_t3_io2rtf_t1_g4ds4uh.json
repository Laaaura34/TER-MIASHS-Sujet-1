Stick with it for a year and re-evaluate then. Everything changes, and the answer is pretty simple: you get all your time back. All the money you would spend, went towards fixing your car, getting a little ahead, maybe investing. You start to see an actual life you\u2019re building, instead of the one you escape from with substances. Also, look at your health, and that will come apparent in the first few months. You will breath better, get your sense of taste and smell back (it\u2019s hard to believe that I was stinky for so many years). You will lose weight\u2014 I will warn you to indulge in sugar as you need to while staying sober, but figure out healthier snacks sooner than later because the weight will come back. \n\nMy whole outlook changed. I remember my days and my nights. I take firm, healthy shits. I get excited when I make progress on my little goals. All that achievement starts to outweigh the artificial happiness you\u2019ve been using as a crutch. But more than anything, it just takes time. Be kind to yourself, remind yourself that you are doing your best. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4ds4uh/"}
