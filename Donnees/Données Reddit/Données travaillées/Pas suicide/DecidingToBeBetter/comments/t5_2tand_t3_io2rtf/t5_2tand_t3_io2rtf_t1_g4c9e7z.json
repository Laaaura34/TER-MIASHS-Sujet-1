The only thing I would add is try to find some way to be creative. I find that when I get myself into something creative (woodworking for me) it pulls me away from my normal thinking and puts me in a place where I don't worry about the normal stressors in my life. Lots of different ways to do that, whether it's drawing/painting, singing, playing an instrument, dance, etc.  Also anything that involves working with something directly with your hands, woodworking works for me, but this could also include gardening, crotchet or something like that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4c9e7z/"}
