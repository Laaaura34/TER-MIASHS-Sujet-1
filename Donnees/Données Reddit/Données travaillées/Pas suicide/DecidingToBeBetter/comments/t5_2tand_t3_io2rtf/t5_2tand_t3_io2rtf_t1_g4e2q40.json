Blow pops (lollipops with gum inside of them) really helped with my oral fixation when I quit smoking and also helped with the anxiety that came along with not knowing what to do with my hand and my anxiety in general. I bought like 4 huge bags of them and would always have them on me. And I went from smoking two pack a day for 10 years, to being 7 years cigarette free. \n\nA good mantra I repeat to myself is:\n\"I've come too far, to only come this far.\"\nIt's helps me when I feel like giving up (no matter what it is in life I'm facing).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4e2q40/"}
