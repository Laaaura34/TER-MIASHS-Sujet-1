I smoked cigs for 20 years, went to rehab for opiates & they put me on Wellbutrin & that knocked my cig addiction out. I\u2019m not telling you to try that, but after Chantix, cold turkey & vaping, that worked for me. I take Kratom now. I\u2019ve been clean & sober for years. I\u2019m also not recommending that, but I have an addictive personality so it was hard to stop everything. Now, I take a teaspoon of that, & go about my day. I\u2019ve lost 50lbs eating right & bought a beautiful home. I\u2019m a functional member of society & I may not be clean to others but I consider myself clean since I\u2019ve got my life to such a better place & only taking the Kratom. Reading really helped a lot too. Find stories that interest you & delve in. Anything that keeps you occupied & interested will help when you\u2019re wanting to alter your consciousness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4dhpkp/"}
