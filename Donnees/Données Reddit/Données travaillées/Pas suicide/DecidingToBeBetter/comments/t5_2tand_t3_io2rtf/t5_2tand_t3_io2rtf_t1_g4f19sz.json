Many people there do in fact realise they cannot use thc at all, the stories of introspection are relatable and alternatives (CBD) are discussed. For me, it reached way deeper than leaves, if that makes sense. \n\nThe reason I didn't mention /r/leaves though is that I saw it already mentioned a few times in the comments, whereas I rarely see petioles (and no one did in fact mention it). I was a member of leaves for well over a year before I ever heard of petioles!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4f19sz/"}
