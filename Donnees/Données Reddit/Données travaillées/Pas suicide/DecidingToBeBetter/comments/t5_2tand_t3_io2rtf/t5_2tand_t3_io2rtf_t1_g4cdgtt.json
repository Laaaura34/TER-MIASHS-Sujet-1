Some might suggest you should do patches for nicotine or the gum but honestly just going cold turkey is the way to do it.  I\u2019m tobacco free 4 years now and think it would have been harder if I kept nicotine in my system. \n\nAs for alcohol, I use to drink a good amount in college (probably a bit more than a good amount haha) and have been going alcohol free for the past 2 months now since I\u2019ve gained a lot of weight in college. The biggest thing I found to help getting over that is exercise. Lifting heavy, being tired, and making your supplement your new \u201caddiction\u201d \n\nGetting over addictions are hard as shit and you\u2019re going to fail. The goal is to keep working and having the will power to keep going.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4cdgtt/"}
