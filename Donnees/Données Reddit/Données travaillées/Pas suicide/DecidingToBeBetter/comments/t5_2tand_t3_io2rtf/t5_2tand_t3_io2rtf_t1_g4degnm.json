It will probably be very hard to quit all 3 at the same time, though not impossible. \n\nAs some have said already, your dopamine levels are gonna be out of whack for awhile and your body will crave that quick hit of dopamine from your vices. \n\nI was told by a doctor in rehab to not be afraid to take one addiction out at a time, so if it get super tough, don\u2019t be afraid to ease your way out by tapering a vice away. Have your long term goals in the forefront, stay motivated, don\u2019t beat yourself up for failing and take it one day at a time. It gets drastically better on the other side of addiction. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4degnm/"}
