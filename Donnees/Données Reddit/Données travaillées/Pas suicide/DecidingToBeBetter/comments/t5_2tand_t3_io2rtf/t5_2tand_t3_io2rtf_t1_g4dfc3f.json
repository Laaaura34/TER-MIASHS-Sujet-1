I am also smoke free for 3 months, and biggest advice I can give is, maybe you can try giving these news to people close to you, and then you will also have another reason to not start again. And all these stuff may seem like they make you happy, and maybe your friend circle was formed around these habbits, but remember, if you keep going, you will first feel some unpleasant emotions but then you will stand stronger and as more complete. And the freedom of not being addicted to any of those will make you feel better, and hopefully more focused&productive( since you wont be craving a cigarette every 40 mins, and no more hangovers). Good luck again, and even if you can\u2019t make it this time, don\u2019t be upset, you will be ready when you are.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4dfc3f/"}
