It honestly took me awhile to fully let go and I still don't think I've fully let go of the resentment and anger I have towards them for some of their actions (nor have I fully forgiven myself for hanging on so long to people who clearly weren't a match, but I digress).... \n\nBut 6 months later I don't find myself spending my days doing things I don't like with people I don't like... It's lonely, but I'm at least being honest and faithful to myself and my standards and that is the best thing I've gained from this experience ... I hope you feel the same.
