If you put a single crab in a box with very short sides it will climb out and get away. If you put a group of them in the same box none will climb out - this is because as soon as one begins to climb over the side the others will pull it back in. I have noticed this same behavior happens in toxic relationships. \n\nGood job in identifying you needed a change and great job in not letting them pull you back in.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ep35hs/i_removed_myself_from_the_group_chat_of_my_oldest/feijc41/"}
