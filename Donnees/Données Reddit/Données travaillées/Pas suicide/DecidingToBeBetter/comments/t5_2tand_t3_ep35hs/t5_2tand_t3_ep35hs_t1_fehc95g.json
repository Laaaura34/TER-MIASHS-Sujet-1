The arguments that happen behind your back may not even happen and if they do, they probably did it before anyways. You can\u2019t keep a negative way of living just because you want to avoid arguments. I\u2019ve learned this the hard way too. I had a bunch of friends who did weed all the time growing up and we grew up not doing anything together. No objection to weed but it wasn\u2019t for me and I hated that our friendships dissolved into just using it and drinking. They would talk about people behind their backs all the time and I realized that when I stopped participating - they were probably doing that about me too. My best friend in the group took forever to respond to my texts and calls to hang out so I just gave it up. I should have gone cold turkey like you instead of dragging it on so long of hating it and then still trying to please them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ep35hs/i_removed_myself_from_the_group_chat_of_my_oldest/fehc95g/"}
