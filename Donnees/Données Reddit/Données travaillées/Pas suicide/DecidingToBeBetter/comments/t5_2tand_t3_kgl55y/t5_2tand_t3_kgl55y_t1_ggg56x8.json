This view will not serve you well. It is a way of avoiding the present by living in the future and agonising over your past. There's a lot of satisfaction to be had from simply paying attention to your senses. Any negative thoughts about your station in life can simply float by like clouds.\n\n\nEvery problem is an opportunity. Internalise that. As far fetched as it may sound, it's true. Even if the opportunity is simply to grow. Make a habit of searching for the opportunity every time your brain comes up with a new problem. Positive thinking takes practice and you could start right now for free. \n\n\nWith this new outlook you can go out into the world and apply for jobs with the knowledge that, even if you don't get offered the position, you are taking positive steps to improve your life, and that even though it didn't work out this time, you have been given the opportunity to learn if you look for it hard enough.\n\n\nAs for explaining your employment gap, let me tell you a secret as a hiring manager. Employees who are dedicated, tenacious, intelligent, proactive, conscientious, responsible, and positive are few and far between. Contrary to a lot of advice on here, rather than giving a vague, dull, and suspicious answer like \"medical reasons\" describe your activities in a way that sounds impressive and highlights any of the adjectives I just listed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kgl55y/i_feel_like_ive_messed_up_ill_be_32_by_the_time_i/ggg56x8/"}
