I can tell you we see this a lot, and while it is something we pay attention to, it is not typically the deciding factor. \n\nThere are several things you can do.\n\n1. As a previous redditor said, list medical issues, without being specific.\n\n2. Find a semester long course from an Ivy league or other well known university and enroll. Apply for jobs the entire time you are enrolled. At least 2/week.  Several of my hires did this. It shows that you are capable and willing to grow after being away from the workforce.\n\n3. Network. For most people this is the hardest. It requires a hefty amount of humility to start to ask your friends, family, professors, etc if their employer is hiring, but it disappears in the rear view mirror eventually.\n\nJobs are rarely given out, and it really sucks getting rejected, but you have to try. After burn out, you have to get a win in, for yourself. \n\nGood luck fellow redditor.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kgl55y/i_feel_like_ive_messed_up_ill_be_32_by_the_time_i/ggfr7td/"}
