This way you can count your calories and macros beforehand so you know exactly how much you're eating in a day. You can check out r/mealprepsunday for more info.\n\nConsistency is the most important part of this, so just keep at it and you'll reach your goals in no time :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lszj89/i_want_to_feel_beautiful/gourcc3/"}
