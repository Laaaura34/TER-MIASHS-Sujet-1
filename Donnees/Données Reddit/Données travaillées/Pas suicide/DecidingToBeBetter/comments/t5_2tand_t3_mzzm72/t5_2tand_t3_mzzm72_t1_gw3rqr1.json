I have learned that food/ED is NOT the problem but rather a SYMPTOM of something else that is wrong in your life. Read that sentence again. And once more. In my case, I had chronic self-hate. My mother over-fed me as a child and I quickly learned to soothe myself with food. I was the fat kid who became full of shame/humiliation and learned how to hate myself. So the interesting thing in my situation is I spent my entire life being put on diets, restricting food, focusing on food, weighing food, going to Weight Watchers etc Food in itself was never the issue!!!!! My issue was the fact that I hated myself. I remember in high school crying and feeling like I was losing my mind because I had failed yet another diet and the doctor said I must be depressed and put me on antidepressants!!!! I wasn't depressed!!!! I didn't need antidepressants. I needed to learn how to rid myself of the deadly self-hate that infiltrated every cell of my body.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mzzm72/18_years_old_and_suicidal_i_dont_know_where_to/gw3rqr1/"}
