To answer your question, I didn't really specifically hurt one person but in general, my behavior was deeply arrogant and unempathetic towards a lot of people (close family/friends) but I still had some surface level \"friends\" at work who never knew what was happening behind closed doors. I have since apologized to my family (sister, parents, 2 of my really close friends who I alienated) and their acceptance definitely gave me cause to break out of this rut. I think I still ruminate on the fact that it happened in the first place; I think forgiving myself might be one of the last steps I need to take to move past this period of time in my life. I hope that makes sense! Thanks again for your response and this insight!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lynhug/does_anyone_else_ruminate_on_their_past_of_making/gqgmj1x/"}
