One of the hardest parts of recovery is realizing all the time we wasted while using. All the opportunities for growth, relationships, meaningful moments,... that we lost in those years. \n\nI drank from 15-24, now I'm 28. I believe my student days would've been so much better if I was sober at the time. Do I want to go back and do it again, but properly? Yes, this is a thought I have frequently,  as 30 approaches and youthful time to experiment seems to run out. Especially due to the pandemic, which is a painful way to lose your last years in your 20s.\n\nWhat can help you? Journaling, therapy, having goals you want to achieve, giving back to the community. I don't know what would 'cure' us from these thoughts, but these can make it easier to deal with them. Maybe we can use this feeling if we ever have cravings? \"Do you want to go back to losing your time?\" \n\nI'll give you a hug! Do you feel you can give yourself some leeway? You did stupid shit when younger, but so did everyone. think about the thoughts and feelings you had then that drove you to these choices. You didn't have the vision you have now. \n\nThe best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the next best time is now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lynhug/does_anyone_else_ruminate_on_their_past_of_making/gptrrnu/"}
