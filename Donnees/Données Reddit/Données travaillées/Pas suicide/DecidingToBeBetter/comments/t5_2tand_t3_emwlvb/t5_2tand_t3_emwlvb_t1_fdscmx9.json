For me, those good hobbies are valued, but you also need to have some social activities too to stimulate your inner world. pro tip: just delete gaming all at once and all memories of it. It has helped me alot to become more productive and spend more time on my friends, hobbies and other things in my life. \n\nI know I know, games ain't bad. They aren't, if you can regulate them. But boy, gaming 9h a day isn't healthy. (used to do this). And especially if you feel bored all the time, it's really easy to go online and play a game to avoid the feeling of boredom.\n\nAnother advice I'd give is: reflect on your life. Buy yourself a paper book and write about thoughts. Eventually you'll learn how to reflect on what makes you happy in life and where you want to go in life to feel more fulfilling. if you don't like paper, maybe simple notes on your desktop can do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/emwlvb/i_want_something_fulfilling/fdscmx9/"}
