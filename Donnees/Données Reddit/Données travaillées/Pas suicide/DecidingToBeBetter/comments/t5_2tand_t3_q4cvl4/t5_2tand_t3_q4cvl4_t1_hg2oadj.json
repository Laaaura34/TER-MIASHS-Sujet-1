Now that I'm getting into the mindset of Being A Good Partner, I'm starting to feel guilty about how I treated him. I completely took advantage of his lack of assertiveness to order him around and use him as a verbal punching bag when I was angry. And I cheated on him a few times. I don't even know why I was with someone I thought of as that disposable, honestly. I hope I didn't hurt him too badly. I'm thinking that I should maybe give him some kind of \"you deserved none of that,\" text, but maybe it would be better if I just permanently left his life.
