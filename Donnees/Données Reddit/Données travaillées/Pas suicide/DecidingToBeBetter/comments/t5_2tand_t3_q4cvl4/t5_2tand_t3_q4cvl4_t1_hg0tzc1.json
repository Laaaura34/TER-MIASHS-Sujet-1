I also don't see any mention of working on yourself possibly in the form of therapy or something else (maybe you have and didn't share?) I would be incredibly curious of my actions if people kept telling me I was manipulative, controlling, and other negative things.\n\nHave you really taken the time to sit down with yourself and unpack these past relationships? Really look at where you thought you may have been manipulative or controlling (maybe they mentioned scenarios to you or how you made them feel?) What were you feeling in those moments? Change your perspective and put yourself in their shoes.\n\nI'm happy you found someone that you love, but I'm worried that you may end up repeating some past mistakes if you really haven't taken the time to fully dissect them and love/understand the man in the mirror. I wish you luck and am here for anything.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4cvl4/i_have_a_long_string_of_relationships_behind_me/hg0tzc1/"}
