You did it before, you have it in you, you can do it again!!! The best part is, you already know how. You know this is possible for you. If you're anything like me, this advice will be relevant: don't spend too much much time feeling guilty or beating yourself up over not being there now. If this happens, either accept that you are resting now, which is necessary, or use those feelings as a stimulus to do something on your to do list. No matter how small, it will help you feel accomplished as you learn to transform and redirect yourself. You can do it, much love! \u2661", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxagby/booked_a_doctors_appointment_booked_a_counseling/hemy2fj/"}
