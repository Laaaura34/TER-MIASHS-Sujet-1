It's not the same as counselling, but connecting with people who understand your struggles from the inside can be really beneficial.\n\nOne of the big challenges with ADHD is we live in a culture that prizes what people do (achievements), and disregards who they are (character). Because executive function (what ADHD fucks with) is directly related to doing the things you plan to do, we fall really short of social expectations. \n\nTalking to people who understand that and have learnt to deal with it could provide you some useful modelling opportunities. There's a flip side as well of course, some people come together with peers to commiserate. There's a place for that, but it sounds like it would be less useful to you right now.\n\nOtherwise, if it's been a while since you've sought medical help for ADHD, definitely do a professional review. It's an outright myth that people 'grow out' of ADHD.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxagby/booked_a_doctors_appointment_booked_a_counseling/hep8wyk/"}
