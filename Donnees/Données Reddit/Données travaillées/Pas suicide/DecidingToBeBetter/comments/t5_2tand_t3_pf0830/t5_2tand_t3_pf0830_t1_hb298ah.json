Reading between the lines, it sounds like you have a lot of \"i should be like X but I'm not\".\n\n\nBrazilian Jiu Jitsu is a huge confidence builder and instills calmness. \n\nBoxing or muay thai gets you comfortable fighting, especially at a fight gym where you spar.\n\nGetting out of your comfort zone (do things that terrify you... Skydive, race motorcycles, downhill mountain biking, roller coasters) makes you comfortable being uncomfortable.\n\nListen to podcasts by jocko willink. He talks a lot about violent mindset, leadership and courage.\n\nLearn to shoot. Pistols, shotguns, modern sporting rifles... Whatever floats your boat.
