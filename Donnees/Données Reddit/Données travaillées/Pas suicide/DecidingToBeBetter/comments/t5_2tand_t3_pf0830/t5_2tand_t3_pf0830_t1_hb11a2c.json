I think that should help, but I have no idea how you would expose yourself to that phobia. This is a very dangerous one to have.\n\nI you keep exposing yourself to those phobias in minute doses. Your brain would eventually unfreeze and than you can train your mind in increments on how to react. It will be a long process but if you keep doing, I think that will help.\n\nI think you can start by standing up for yourself in a smaller very inconsequential situations. Stand up for yourself and you family everyday, find atleast one thing to stand up for and than incrementally increase your bar. If you fail, doesn't matter. Stand up again the next day. Don't hold that failure over your head.\n\nHope this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pf0830/i_fear_that_im_a_coward_i_want_to_change_but_i/hb11a2c/"}
