Would highly suggest exploring your past experiences especially those from your childhood and paying attention to both what happened and SHOULD have happened but didn\u2019t. It\u2019s likely you might find an experience that prevents you from standing up like that. I\u2019ve yet to find a good book that specifically targets identifying and releasing specific blocks in various areas, but there are a few - \n\n\nRunning on Empty and Adult Children if Emotionally Immature Parents - don\u2019t just dismiss these books without checking them out - people tend to be good at heart. Also doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re flawed, everyone has blocks from various people growing up, not just parents but authority figures, extended family etc. so yeah I highly suggest looking more into this area of healing. \n\nAlso, strive to master your breath and presence. Grounding practices, breathing techniques, martial arts training in some form, meditation and qi gong are all good ways to improve this. Pm me if you want more specific advice on these or the above.\nThe freezing reaction seems to come from the nervous system being overloaded (or unable to cope with the intensity) during stressful times and/or past experiences that hold us back.\nThat\u2019s my advice - feel free to ask me further questions.
