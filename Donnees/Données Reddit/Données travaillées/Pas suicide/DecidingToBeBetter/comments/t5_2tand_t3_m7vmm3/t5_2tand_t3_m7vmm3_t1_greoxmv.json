But it back fired cos it reinforced my critical tendencies which I then turned on myself. So I felt even worse about myself! Plus people didn't like me.\n\nI read a lot about near death experiences and changed my philosophy. I decided to try to make people feel better so if there's an afterlife I would experience their happy feelings, not their sad feelings.\n\nI've found it has made my life better. I'm happier and get on better with people.\n\nTwo useful books - Self Esteem by McKay and Fanning and Self compassion by Kirsten Neff.\n\nGood on you and good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7vmm3/ive_decided_to_stop_being_mean/greoxmv/"}
