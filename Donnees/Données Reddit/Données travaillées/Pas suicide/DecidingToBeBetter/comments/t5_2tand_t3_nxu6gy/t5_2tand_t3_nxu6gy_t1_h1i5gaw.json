I got my license at 22, my first car at 24 and my GED at 26. I then got my college degree at 31. The best decision I ever made for myself was to go back and get that GED. My life would be worse without it. I am now working for a dream job making x3 the amount I was making before. \n\n5 years from now, that future you will thank current you who made the sacrifices and the decision to better yourself.
