Without these everything else suffers. \n\nI would add principles/decision making. This is really about building your understanding of cause and effect, defining your criteria, and analyzing outcomes and predicting new outcomes. Your life will be based on the decisions you make and improving your ability to make good decision will be critical. This involves knowing how and why you make decisions, and then assessing the outcomes. As Ray Dalio says the question is \"how do I successfully deal with my realities so I get what I want?\"\n\nCareers are remarkably short when you consider how much time you have to build it, fuck it up, and rebuild it. If you're off course at 40, it is going to be really hard to turn it around. Have a very definite plan for building a career.
