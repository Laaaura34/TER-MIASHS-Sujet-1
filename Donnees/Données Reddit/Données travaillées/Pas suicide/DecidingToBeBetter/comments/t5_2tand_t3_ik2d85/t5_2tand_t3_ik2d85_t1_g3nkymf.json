Even if she has a friend she can stay with she'd be better off. But people have to find their own ways out of bad situations.\n\nI told myself that I had to open my eyes and believe what I was seeing, and that the change he talked about was not real change, and wasn't enough to make me comfortable he wasn't still cheating. But I knew that if someone or something didn't change I was going to kill myself. So since I was powerless against him changing, I forced myself to face the pain of ripping him from my life after fourteen years of supporting him.\n\nSee, I lost my mom a couple years ago and learned how much I hate and fear the feelings of grief or loss. I never processed her death and didn't want to do it again with the next person closest to me. I knew divorce would mean grief and I did think I could handle that. But if I didn't put my foot down and say his behavior can't be allowed to hurt me anymore, I was going to end up dead, either physically or emotionally, and my mom would never have wanted that for me.\n\nSo I decided that enough HAS been enough and my endless chances have to end. I called him and told him to pack his things and he agreed, and that's that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ik2d85/i_decided_to_stop_giving_my_husband_chances_to/g3nkymf/"}
