I'm still stuck in a similar relationship where he's a zombie. I thought I was the only one to blame cause the depression I had. But now that I'm better is the same with him, it's awful how we put ourselves to be good for others. I'm just in the trial version of giving him resources and asking him to help himself if he wants to be in a good relationship, but I can't force him. I'm very impressed what you've accomplish and I wish you the best. Hopefully this post inspires and helps a lot of women struggling.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ik2d85/i_decided_to_stop_giving_my_husband_chances_to/g3irf9m/"}
