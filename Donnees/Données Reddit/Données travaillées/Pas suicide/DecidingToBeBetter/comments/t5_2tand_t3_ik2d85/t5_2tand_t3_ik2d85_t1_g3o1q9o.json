That was a very clear answer that helped me move on. I hope you can find that. It is hard to leave and that's okay. It took a lot of setting boundaries and learning to say no to get there myself.\n\nI'd say, I'm not doing x for him anymore, for me it was emotional labor and paying expenses, until he shows some effort. He'd show the tiniest bit of effort and then ask me for some huge favor. Like, he moved some stuff I couldn't lift after surgery and then asked me to do taxes with him and pay in his half of five hundred bucks because he didn't have the cash. It's September and I still didn't get paid back yet from July. It's likely I never will. I should have said no.\n\nBut that helped me set and hold the next boundary, like now I'm disconnecting you from anything you use me to benefit from, including emotional support, and you can have that back after you do x. And he agreed to do x, but instead he ended up doing his ex. Again. Like, you hold yourself behind a safe line and give them ways to access you if they make certain changes. You cannot force them to change but if they don't even try, there's your answer. And if they do try but it doesn't stick, that's more manipulation.\n\nI wish you the best. It sounds like you can only count on yourself for support in that relationship so if you can manage it I really hope you can support yourself getting the fuck out of there. Good luck and please stay safe.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ik2d85/i_decided_to_stop_giving_my_husband_chances_to/g3o1q9o/"}
