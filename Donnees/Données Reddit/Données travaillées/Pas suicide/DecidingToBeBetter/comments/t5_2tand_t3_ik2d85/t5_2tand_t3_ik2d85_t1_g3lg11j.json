Thank you so much for asking.\n\nI've somewhat abandoned my IG (Custom You Suits, as I used to make menswear for online commissions before things fell apart, and he was my model so I'm trying to decide what to do with that account.) but I really should keep it just for an art account. I've been doing a lot of embroidery too that I'd like to post there.\n\nI post everything related my writing on Twitter under @omg_giant_rock, where I post links to the story I self published and two audiobooks by other authors that I've narrated.\n\nMy website, linked on my Twitter profile, is super under construction, but it's where I'll be keeping all the links to all the things I have available as well as future projects, like whatever I'm going to do with the story I finish when it's done.\n\nI really appreciate you asking!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ik2d85/i_decided_to_stop_giving_my_husband_chances_to/g3lg11j/"}
