The problem is that *we're* in the wrong place - this sub is rarely about helping people becoming truly, genuinely, more mature and better (which is rooted in humility, compassion, etc...). I see the most disgraceful stuff get upvoted here all the time, and sober viewpoints like I've respectfully shared here (despite the temper tantrum response) get downvoted into oblivion - lets be clear, they're literally opposed to my plea for compassion. Nuff said.\n\nThe question is, knowing this, why would I even bother with this quixotic quest? But, I persist with it, because it's not uncommon for me to get a PM (after I write an essay-like comment) saying \"thank you so much for being a voice of insight and reason - you've completely shifted my perspective on life.\"\n\nInterestingly, I often have wonderful conversations in the nether regions of posts here, because it's a self-selecting group of people who are so incredulous at the entire thread that they eventually find a breath of fresh air in the exiled comments.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ik2d85/i_decided_to_stop_giving_my_husband_chances_to/g3iqfkg/"}
