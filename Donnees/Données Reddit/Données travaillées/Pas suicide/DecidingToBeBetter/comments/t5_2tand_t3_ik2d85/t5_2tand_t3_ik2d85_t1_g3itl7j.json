I finally left my husband back in February after years of making sure that he was happy and fulfilled in his life while being suicidal and not dealing with my own problems. I am happy to say I am finally in a relationship where things are 50/50 and I feel emotionally fulfilled. I have hobbies again and a partner (in all sense of the word) who supports them and makes me feel good about doing them. Things get so much better!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ik2d85/i_decided_to_stop_giving_my_husband_chances_to/g3itl7j/"}
