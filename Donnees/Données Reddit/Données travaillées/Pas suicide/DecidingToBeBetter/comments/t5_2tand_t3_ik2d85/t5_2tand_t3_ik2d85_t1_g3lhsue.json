I've limited my TV time but still allow myself days where I drop my goals and play a video game for six hours, haha.\n\nThe drawings are to enhance my current story, although I'm just practicing for now, but it's not anything I NEED in order to write so if I don't have time that's the first thing to go.\n\nI am trying to find a balance. I decided to start college when he moved out because I realized that I felt like I couldn't spend that much time on myself or he'd cheat on me, which is fucked up and drove me right into a college class. Then I thought about getting a new job and went to an interview, but decided I couldn't handle that much change and turned it down.\n\nIt's been little by little, prioritizing this or that until I found this balance. I've been working on making time for college since May, the writing for a couple months, the uke for a few weeks, and the drawing is new.\n\nQuarantine helps a bit because I have next to no social obligations lately so I have time for me and my household for now. All that doesn't mean I can't still burn out, just that I am already trying to be careful of what I commit to.\n\nIn any case I very much appreciate the reality check.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ik2d85/i_decided_to_stop_giving_my_husband_chances_to/g3lhsue/"}
