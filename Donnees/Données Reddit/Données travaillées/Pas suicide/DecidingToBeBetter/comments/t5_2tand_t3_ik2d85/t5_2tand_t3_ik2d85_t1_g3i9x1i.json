He has!\n\nI recommend you look up the song Broken Pieces by Apocalyptica. It's been perfect to my situation. You can't change people, and their failure is NOT your fault!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FV7gw26T5V8\n\n\"I'm losing this, and I'm losing you\" but what they don't say so explicitly in the song is that that's better than losing ourselves instead.\n\nI absolutely could have killed myself this year. He was acting so blatantly awful, knowing it wasn't okay, but swore up and down he wasn't cheating, so I was at my wit's end on what the hell felt so wrong. I think he could tell I was so desperate for answers that I might do something drastic just to get some relief, that he finally came clean this time.\n\nSo, your SO, like mine, might need a chance to fall on his ass before he learns to get up on his own. Or, like I've been told recently, some people don't have a rock bottom. And we do NOT deserve to be dragged that far down with them.\n\nIt's hard and only you can know what's really best for yourself but there are brighter days on the other side of a bad relationship.
