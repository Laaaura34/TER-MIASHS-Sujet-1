If you can support her please, please do. Ask her how she's doing, let her vent, encourage her to talk about the situation. If she's conflicted, let her talk out why and give her some rational ideas. It helps SO much!\n\nMy dad supported and encouraged my choice, and I live with in-laws who are happy for me to keep living with them, and stayed up till 3 am so many nights while I cried and talked it all out with them. I also started using the Better Help therapy app. I did not do this alone and your friend shouldn't have to either!\n\nYou can always pm me if either of you have questions or need advice. Good luck to you both!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ik2d85/i_decided_to_stop_giving_my_husband_chances_to/g3ie12k/"}
