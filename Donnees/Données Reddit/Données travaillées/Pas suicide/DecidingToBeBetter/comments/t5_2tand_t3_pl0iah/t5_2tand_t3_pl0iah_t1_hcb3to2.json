All I knew is that I was anxious as hell about it. I went into my therapists office with a laundry list of stuff to talk about. I could barely make it through with out breaking down. My therapist had to work for a couple weeks just to get my confidence up enough just to talk. After the talking started, she really helped my identify negative thought cycles. And boy, did I have a lot of them. I started tracking my thoughts and found that 90% of them were anxious or self deprecating. With my therapist, I was slowly starting to turn negative thoughts in to positive thoughts, and that\u2019s when things really changed. It allowed me to start working through a lot of my past. I learned a lot about emotional inheritance, and it\u2019s link to my poor mental health. I grew up in a family where emotions and feelings were never talked about. I internalized everything. I had spiritual baggage as well (I was raised in a white evangelical setting) I won\u2019t get into that too much, but either way, all of that stuff fucked me up pretty good. But thanks to that single choice to go to therapy, I\u2019m past that all. I\u2019ve been able to be open with my parents about this, and that was one of the greatest healing moments in my journey. Bitterness corrupted my soul, and as I work to deal with it, I\u2019m really getting back to my true identity.\n\nHopefully this answers your question.\n\nNow I just use therapy as a tool to keep growing. I love having an outside perspective.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pl0iah/i_quit_drinking_quit_my_toxic_job_and_went_to/hcb3to2/"}
