Sure, the chapter you're in right now is a tough one and hopefully being where you are is a personal decision and not one given to you.  Be present in the moment and catch your thoughts because ultimately thoughts dictate the results we see in life.\n\nI'd encourage you to reprogram your brain towards positivity.  One video I always recommend to people is by an artist named Struthless entitled, \"5 Questions That Changed My Life.\"  I literally have those 5 questions right next to my monitor and I've used them to change how I view everything I encounter.  Eventually, to where I am currently, I see the silver-lining and don't choose to take the negative pathways in my brain.\n\nJust think, you get to go to school, you have a social circle, you have a boyfriend, a job,  a place to call your own, and you're not wandering in life, you have plenty to be proud of and be grateful for. \n\nHope this encourages you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1b5rk/i_need_to_change_my_life_around_20f/hfe9kj4/"}
