The lie refers to the notion addicts carry before they\u2019re truly exposed to recovery and a better way of life. This notion is that life is only enjoyed when you\u2019re high... that being sober is pointless. That you\u2019ll always be a fuck up and disappoint your family. That you can\u2019t stop no matter how hard you try. \n\nSaying the lie is dead, we do recover.
