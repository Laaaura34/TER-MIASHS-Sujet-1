Probably you still have to fight with parts of your brain that are still asking that. Months or years of addiction requires a lot of effort to remove but you can do that.  Just replace those dopamine shots with other things  that don't get addictive, be strong and be better than yesterday.\n\nThis experience can help you a lot and can help many people a lot. You can help other people get rid of it and even make a living out of it.\n\nI trully believe in you that you can be better than yesterday and tomorrow better than today.
