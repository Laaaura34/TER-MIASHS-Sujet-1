I'm proud of you, too! Every recovery story matters, and every battle against addiction is hard-won indeed. I'm glad you were able to reconcile with your family, it was brave of you to realize how it affected them also and work hard to rebuild those bonds. I pray some of my own loved ones can come to these same conclusions. I've turned my back on family members, I fell out with my cousin and she told me to forget I knew her. So I did, for 3 years. And not a day of that 3 years passed that I didn't think of her or stop loving her. As I got older I realized my view of addiction also lacked compassion and we've since made up. Sometimes you just have to love people from a distance to protect your own wellbeing. Sending love, light, and support to everyone fighting their own battles. You're loved by this internet stranger and I believe in you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ft4uzz/10_days_clean_from_crystal_meth/fm5m7qr/"}
