Did it 5+ years. Time disappeared on me during that time. I up and decided to move to another city in hopes that would work. It did not, I got worse. Decided to move back to my hometown. Got worse yet....\nThen I had enough... Moved again, after getting the best score I had ever made. Threw all of it out the window on the highway and that was almost 4 years ago. Haven't done it since. I've even been offered it a few times and declined. I never will do it again", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ft4uzz/10_days_clean_from_crystal_meth/fm64i5l/"}
