Take care of it. DO NOT skip oil changes. Have a good trustworthy mechanic take a look at it and have a plan to keep it running. Change tires when needed. \n\nGood luck with college! Study hard and try to stay focused. Seeing that you spent a large chunk of your savings on the car/laptop I can imagine your budget is tight and you will be depending on student loans for school. HAVE A PLAN for your education and a clear direction of where you want to take your career in order to repay your funding once you graduate. DO NOT spend money unnecessarily just because you have it.. realize that this is not your money you are borrowing it. You will be required to pay it back with interest and that can really put you in a rut if you are not prepared. Not to frighten you or deter you from school but please be aware of this fact. I have many MANY friends and family who are in a tight spot because of it.\n\nGood luck and godspeed!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6y968/update_i_passed_my_ged_tests_bought_a_car_and_a/h2wrkq2/"}
