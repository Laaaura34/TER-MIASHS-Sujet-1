Maybe try to discuss with management or the owners how you feel. If they are absent, they may not know the current situation, and you may not be alone in feeling the way you do.

Talking to your partner/family about maybe moving on might help crystalize things as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjn5xs/what_to_do_when_work_motivation_falls_flat/hbzyhtu/"}
