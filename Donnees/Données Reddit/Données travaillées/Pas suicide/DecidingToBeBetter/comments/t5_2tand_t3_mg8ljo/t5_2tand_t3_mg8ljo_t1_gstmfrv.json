There are over 100 characters to pick from, and every character can play multiple role on a team and can have different build. \n\nEven if you were to pick the same character repeatedly, every game is different. You will play against different opponent, some matchup favors you, and some are difficult. The matchup also changes if you are assisted by your teammates.\n\nIt's also essential for you to understand all of the heroes so you understand how to synergize together as teammates, learn to counter play, or make the best out of a bad matchup.\n\nLong story short, it's complex and it is constantly changing through patches. Kind of like Chess but with even more layers of variables.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg8ljo/i_decided_to_uninstall_league_of_legends_before/gstmfrv/"}
