I'm not into gaming, but have deleted my reddit account just like that, upon reaching the point where I was too active on too many subs and generallly spent days just scrolling and getting lost within all the \"amazing\" \"satisfying\" content with all the mandatory uni essays pilling up. I'd justify this to myself by subscribing to multiple informative subreddits and \"keeping myself educated\", but these random facts are worthless when you're only skimming over university material and abandoning the subject that you're actually trying to become an expert in.\nMight delete this account as well if it starts interfering too much with my daily life and productivity.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg8ljo/i_decided_to_uninstall_league_of_legends_before/gssbyct/"}
