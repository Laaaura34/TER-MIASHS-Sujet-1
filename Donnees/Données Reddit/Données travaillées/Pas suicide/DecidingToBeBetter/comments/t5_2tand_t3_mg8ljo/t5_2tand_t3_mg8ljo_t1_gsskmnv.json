Funnily enough I started playing league just as I started university, (I'm now finishing my 2nd year). In the beginning it was really addictive and I played quite a lot, but I think it's all about balance. Like, if you can't focus on your studies and you're actually falling behind then you need to reduce your playtime. But honestly, I think there's no problem just playing in the evenings for a couple of hours, when you're not studying. I know some friends for example who would study during the day, and then after 6pm they had the evening to do whatever they want, be it gaming, watching TV, etc. However, if you have bad self control an addictive personality and find yourself playing it all day, not doing your essays, skipping classes, then yes I'd agree deleting the game is essential.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg8ljo/i_decided_to_uninstall_league_of_legends_before/gsskmnv/"}
