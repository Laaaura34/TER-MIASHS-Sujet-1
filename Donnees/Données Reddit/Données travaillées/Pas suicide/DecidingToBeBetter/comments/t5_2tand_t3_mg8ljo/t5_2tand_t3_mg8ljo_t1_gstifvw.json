It's a particular kind of addictive because when you pick it up, you HAVE to play for at least 30-60m, otherwise you let your team down. :( It's awesome that you're self-aware and I truly wish you the best of luck! <3\n\nAs for me, I was obsessed with console gaming myself when I went to university, so I made the conscious decision to leave my console at home. It was hard, but I found other things to occupy my time with. You don't need to fill your old gaming time with JUST productivity since that's a ticket to burn out; instead, let your boredom push you into campus activities: join clubs, meet people, pick up creative hobbies, etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg8ljo/i_decided_to_uninstall_league_of_legends_before/gstifvw/"}
