When habits devolve into dependence and addiction, we\u2019re avoiding something. It often starts out as being pleasurable and fun. Drinking, drugs, sex, gaming, it can all be fun in moderation. If it takes over our lives and interferes with our relationships and daily activities, we\u2019ve stopped doing it for the fun and pleasure, and started doing it for what we\u2019re not feeling instead. \n\nThose feelings will still be there, but you won\u2019t have the LOL to escape from it. Sit with those feelings, acknowledge them. Acknowledge the discomfort. Acknowledge that you would like to make it stop or get away from it, but you\u2019re going to sit alongside it. \n\nThey will ebb. \n\nEach time it will get easier and you will feel stronger and a greater pride and confidence in yourself. Don\u2019t fall for the all or nothing fallacy either. If you have a slip, it doesn\u2019t mean you need to go back to how you were. Everyday is a new day. Acknowledge where things went off track, why, how they got there. Do what you need to do to prevent it happening again to the best of your ability, and start afresh the next day. \n\nBe proud of you. Put up photos in your study of the country you want to study in. Make a vision board of where you want to be living with that scholarship. It makes it a lot more real. \n\nShoot for the stars OP", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg8ljo/i_decided_to_uninstall_league_of_legends_before/gss8zeo/"}
