The struggle is real, and when you are naturally introverted it\u2019s never easy to be social unless you have anonymity to hide behind. \nAccept that who you are is who you are, and it\u2019s fine. Anybody that tells you that you need to come out of your comfort zone and be more social is trying to change who you are at your core. Accept yourself and others will follow. Respect your needs. You know what you need.\n\nAnd btw it\u2019s not strange. This type of thing is rampant today.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5fvqi/my_strange_addiction/hg5e9om/"}
