The only tip I have to get 1% better is media replacement. Pick an activity that you sink time into usually when you get home or take a break and change it to something good. You may fail at it a few times but if you keep getting on that horse you\u2019ll eventually change your interest. \n\nThen you can change your habits\n\nFor example: on my 15 minute breaks at work at a new job I just decided to take walks. It\u2019s hot where I live but I could do 15 minutes. I see increases to my walking speed, slightly more energy by the end of 3 months and ended up jumping on a lot of podcasts and affirmations instead of Fantasy audiobooks and simply music because I was already walking instead of sitting. \n\nWhen I was in basic training (failed) my diet was influenced to change so when I got out I promised myself that I\u2019d keep it and my workout regimen up. Yes, I failed the workout regimen but I haven\u2019t even looked at soda the same. So maybe take a class or do a group workout. The commitment might influence that re-parenting.
