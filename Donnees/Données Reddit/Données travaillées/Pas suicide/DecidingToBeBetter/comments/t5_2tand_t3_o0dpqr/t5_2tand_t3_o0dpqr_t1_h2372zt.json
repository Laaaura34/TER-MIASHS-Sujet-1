There are more successes from small continuous change than grand messianic gestures.\n\nCheer like hell for yourself when you hit even the smallest success.\n\nForgive yourself every mistake you've ever made.  Commit to being proud of your actions as much as possible and doing it every day.  Go to sleep knowing that you did good things.  \n\n\nAlso, be kind to old people,  I'm becoming one, and I'm going to be relying on the kindness of strangers since I don't have much in the way of family :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0dpqr/ive_decided_to_be_better_how_do_i_actually_start/h2372zt/"}
