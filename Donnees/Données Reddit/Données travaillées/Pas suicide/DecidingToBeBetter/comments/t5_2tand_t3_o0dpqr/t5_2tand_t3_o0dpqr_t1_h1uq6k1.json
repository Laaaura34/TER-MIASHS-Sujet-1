For me it started off simply getting rid of \"snooze\", When the alarm goes off, I get up, period. That took a little while to get used to but now I don't even consider going for \"just five more minutes\" in the morning anymore.\n\nSo over the past year or so my morning routine grew into (did not start like this from day one!) something like this:\n\nGet up as soon as the alarm goes off.\n\nStart the coffee pot.\n\nMake my bed  (making the bed is KEY, it's a simple task that immediately makes your bedroom look cleaner, which reduces stress).\n\nShower while coffee is finishing up and cooling down to a drinkable temp.\n\nGet dressed, completely, even if I have no intention of leaving the house.\n\nDrink coffee while reading or watching something informative on Youtube.\n\nBrush teeth once coffee is done.\n\nGet on with my day.\n\nGetting up and getting moving as soon as possible is important to signal your body that it is time to be awake and not asleep.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0dpqr/ive_decided_to_be_better_how_do_i_actually_start/h1uq6k1/"}
