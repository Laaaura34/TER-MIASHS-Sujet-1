Treat it as a stream of consciousness. \n\nI had a really rough childhood. Ive experienced a lot of trauma and as a result, my mind isnt the most positive. It can be very negative at times.\n\nWhen i journal though, i catch myself in negative self-talk, and i snuff it out when i can.\nFor example, instead of saying \u201cI wish i wouldve done this better\u201d\nI write i will do this better next time.\n\nThat little difference in sentence structure makes all the world in practicing compassionate self-care.\n\nIt definitely isnt going to change over night, but after just weeks if journaling i feel a tremendous difference already.\n\nYour identity isn\u2019t defined by your past, its defined by the actions you take now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdd5ia/how_to_not_be_negative_all_the_time_how_to_not/haqnhtl/"}
