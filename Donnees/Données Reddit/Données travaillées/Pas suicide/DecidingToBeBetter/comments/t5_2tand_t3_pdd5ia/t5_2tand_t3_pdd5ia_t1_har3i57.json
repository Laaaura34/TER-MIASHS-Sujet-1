It is a mental habit that is grown with daily practice and patience. \n\nAs a musician who practices every day, this really made it click for me.\n\nSo the question then was: How do I practice happiness? \n\nIf you Google that question you will get the same answer from EVERYWHERE. From every religion, from every motivational speaker, from every happy person in the world. Gratitude. \n\nFeeling thankful for what you have, appreciating what you have in the moment, the people in your life, the things you have that are strengths. \n\nWhen you figure this out, practicing your way to \u201chappiness\u201d (and therefore resilience in the face of difficulties) is as easy as listing out loud, or writing down 5 things you are grateful for every day.\n\nI stopped with the writing it quickly because I would forget. But at some point I would say 5 things I was grateful for that day every day. The few years I was doing that daily I still look back on as the happiest in my life. It really works. Every time I\u2019m struggling, I\u2019ll pick it back up for a week, or a month. \n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdd5ia/how_to_not_be_negative_all_the_time_how_to_not/har3i57/"}
