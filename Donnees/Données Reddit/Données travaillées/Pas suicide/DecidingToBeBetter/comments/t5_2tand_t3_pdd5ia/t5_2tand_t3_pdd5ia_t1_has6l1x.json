It's not easy to to quit. Try your best to stop the habit of saying negative thoughts into existence by doing something thing new every time you think negative thoughts. Something new could be taking a couple deep breaths. If not that, say something good about anything. It won't always work, but it's worth trying. \n\nYou can create an anchor to your hope of change.
