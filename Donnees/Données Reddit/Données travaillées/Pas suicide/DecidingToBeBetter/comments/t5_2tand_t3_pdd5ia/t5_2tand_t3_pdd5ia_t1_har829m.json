I do agree that it doesn\u2019t happen over night and it is a daily practice and it\u2019s so fucking hard. I still struggle all the time and have noticed it\u2019s better when I drink less- working on it and only doing it in social settings. My friend, her mom, and I are in a group chat and every day we text each other 3 things we are grateful for. It can be hard sometimes to come up with things, but once you get it and really think about the small things it helps (even if just for a minute)! You can do it and so can I! You aren\u2019t alone because this is exactly how I feel.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdd5ia/how_to_not_be_negative_all_the_time_how_to_not/har829m/"}
