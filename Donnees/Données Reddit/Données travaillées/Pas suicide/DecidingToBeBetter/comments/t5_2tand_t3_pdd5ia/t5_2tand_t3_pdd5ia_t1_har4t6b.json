I named him Bobo. Bobo likes to drink ( a lot!! Like seriously a lot, like a handle a day) and generally be a shitty human being. Bobo hates most everyone, especially me. I chose to lock Bobo in a cage. He must stay there in that cage for my safety. Bobo is a dick. I don't hear from him much anymore, and when I do, it has grown much easier with time, to disassociate myself from his negativity. Listen, if I can change, you can too. Life is amazing for me now and when I complain, I can remember what it was like when Bobo ran the show. Makes my complaints now, somewhat hilarious. It is still difficult, sometimes to not feed that negativity. But now? It is very possible. Just took sustained effort and the choice to lock Bobo away and not entertain his negativity. Best of luck and always here to chat if it helps!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdd5ia/how_to_not_be_negative_all_the_time_how_to_not/har4t6b/"}
