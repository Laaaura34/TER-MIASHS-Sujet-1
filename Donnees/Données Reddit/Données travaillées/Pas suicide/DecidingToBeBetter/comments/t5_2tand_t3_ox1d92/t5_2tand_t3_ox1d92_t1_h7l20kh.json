I am gay too and I think its normal for gay people to be late bloomers in romance. The world is centered around heterosexual love. If you are lgbt, it's unlikely to come as naturally as heterosexual relationship. There are just way less gay people in the world.\n\nOnline dating is a good place to find someone. Also, there are lots of good lgbt meetups where you can make lgbt friends too. I personally never felt comfortable talking about my love life with straight friends. \n\nPlease don't be so hard on yourself! There is happiness out there but it takes effort find it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox1d92/how_to_get_rid_of_the_feeling_that_time_is/h7l20kh/"}
