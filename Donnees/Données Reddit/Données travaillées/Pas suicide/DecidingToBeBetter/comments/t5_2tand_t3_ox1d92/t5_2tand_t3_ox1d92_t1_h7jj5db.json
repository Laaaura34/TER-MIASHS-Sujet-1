I felt the same way. I kept feeling like I was behind because I\u2019ve been in and out of college a few times, but still don\u2019t have a degree. I\u2019ve worked all sorts of jobs, travelled the world, but I still don\u2019t have a career. Then I started to realize a few things.\n1. Many of my friends who burned through and got a degree right after high school don\u2019t have a job in their degree field.\n2. Many extremely successful people didn\u2019t achieve their success until their 30s and 40s at the earliest.\n3. All my time outside of a career has allowed me to gain a wealth of experience to draw from for life, family, and career!\nThere\u2019s a reason the minimum age for President is 35, yet most elected Presidents are well into their 50s or older.\n\nRegarding sex:\nJust like career, people progress at their own pace. There is nothing wrong with taking things slow. I was a little on the later end, too. I was 19 when I lost my virginity. I\u2019ve dated plenty of people, but I\u2019ve only had a handful of sexual partners.\n\nThings you might consider:\n1. Know how to take care of your pleasure. Learn your body and what feels good. Become comfortable and confident with what you look like. You don\u2019t have to be an expert in sex to be completely sexy. There\u2019s nothing hotter than someone who is confident and eager.\n2. The only way to have sex is to actively look for it. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to be bar hopping. People are naturally sexual animals. I met my wife at a Barnes and Noble. But you won\u2019t find sex if you\u2019re not looking for it, even in a committed relationship\u2026\n3. Sometimes sex gets elevated above a reasonable level. If you find that you\u2019re having anxiety or concerns that are preventing you from going out to find a partner, speak with a therapist. There are therapists who specialize is sex counseling.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox1d92/how_to_get_rid_of_the_feeling_that_time_is/h7jj5db/"}
