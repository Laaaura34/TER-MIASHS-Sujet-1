Enjoy the time you have, it doesn't matter if you have to focus on getting laid, or studying. Just don't feel bad about it, every instant you are forced to decide on what you will spend time on, can you really blame yourself for judging that wrong sometimes?\nAbout the NSFW part: You're probably just being peer pressured in a way. You see your friends and people you've known for years, and people on TV shows and whatever, getting laid and you feel like a loser because you're the only one that \"can't\".\nTry to get your head out of it for a while, find some time and go take a stroll down a park or wtv, do more things that you like. You're \"betting\" your salvation on anothers person will to have sex with you. Make your own happiness, and in time, you will find what you REALLY want. I really believe anyone can get laid dude, just take your time, trust me I've been there. But you've got to chill about it for a while ok?\nYou seem anxious dude that is all, I'm guessing you had a tough couple of days. Do something that is calming to you bro. For me its working out, you know what does it for you.\nBottom line is, dont bet your happiness on other people, it may suck at first, but do you, personal growth is important to feeling good bro, and it does get better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox1d92/how_to_get_rid_of_the_feeling_that_time_is/h7kobwp/"}
