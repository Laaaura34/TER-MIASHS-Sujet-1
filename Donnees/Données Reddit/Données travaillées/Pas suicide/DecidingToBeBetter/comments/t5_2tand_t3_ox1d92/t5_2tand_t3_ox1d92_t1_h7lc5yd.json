Western life has become hyper sexual, hyper consumerism, and everyone is always in a rush doing something. This planet has more Indians and Chinese than anything. And a lot of them live with their parents until they finish their studies and start a career and than get married (often arranged, but not always). Statistically these are some of the most successful ppl with the highest income and lowest rate of divorce in western countries. The family values and support system are quite enviable as far as I\u2019m concerned too. It\u2019s why so many of them own homes and their own businesses. Anyways your still a kid and will be until you are at least 28 (google Saturn Return).
