The 20s should be about getting a degree, partying with friends, date with hot chicks, have a cool hobby like wall climbing or kung fu. Then to earn money and to travel to places.\n\nYou're are a full fledged adult now. Which means you have all the freedom to do whatever you want until you take responsibility for it (don't commit crimes please).\n\nYou should move out from the family home as soon as you can. It helped on my mental state, becoming somewhat independent.\n\nGood luck and remember, old people regret the things they didn't do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox1d92/how_to_get_rid_of_the_feeling_that_time_is/h7m06l1/"}
