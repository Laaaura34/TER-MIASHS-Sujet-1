The problem is that you don't want to hear that this is all a part of growing up, but that's the truth. You, as the adult, although your parents may have failed you in ways, are responsible for your own personal growth and development. Enroll at community college or fibd a trade. You have to start at the bottom and make your way to the top. Also, the world is unkind. You need thick skin to make it. Nobody is going to make accomodations or exceptions for your fears and anxieties. You are responsible for managing your own mental health as an adult. I suggest investing in mental health or a life coach.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dkfwkb/help_im_terrified_to_get_a_job_im_almost_21_i/f4e8pwv/"}
