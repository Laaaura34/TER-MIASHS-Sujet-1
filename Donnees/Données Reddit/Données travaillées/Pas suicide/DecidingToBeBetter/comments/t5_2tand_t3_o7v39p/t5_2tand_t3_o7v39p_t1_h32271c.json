The way to get into the mindset you want is to take action in doing self care and the mindset of self confidence will follow naturally. Self care will mean your body ends up how it is meant to be anyway and by that point you will wake up one day and realise you love yourself. Awareness of where you want to get is a great step but I've found you cant think your way to all the outcomes and action is necessary first sometimes and just trusting you're doing the right things.\nThat's what happened with me anyway.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o7v39p/disconnecting_the_idea_that_happiness_with/h32271c/"}
