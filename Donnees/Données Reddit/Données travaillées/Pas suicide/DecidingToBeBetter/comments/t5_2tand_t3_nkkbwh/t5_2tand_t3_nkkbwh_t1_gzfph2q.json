Seriously, don't worry about girls man. Girls come and go all the time. Some won't date you, some will, and perhaps one day one will marry you. There's nothing wrong with trying to impress or get close to your crush. But don't bend over backwards to win them over. Don't go out of your way to be overly nice and helpful and don't, oh absolutely *don't* make them your first priority over yourself.\n\nGlad that you realised what you were doing and pulled out of it. Now go find a better girl, there's plenty of fish in the sea!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nkkbwh/today_i_decided_to_stop_simping_over_my_crush/gzfph2q/"}
