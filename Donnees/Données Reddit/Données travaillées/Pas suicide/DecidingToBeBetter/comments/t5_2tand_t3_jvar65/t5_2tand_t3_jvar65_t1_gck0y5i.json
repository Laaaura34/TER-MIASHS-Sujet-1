I think the sooner you deal with these feelings, the better!!  Built up unprocessed emotions will only make the problem worse and *that* much harder to deal with in the future. \n\nTry meditating 10 min a day, listening to podcasts about healing and trauma (Tim Ferris, Petter Attia), go for walks, get back into your school life etc.. A lot of healing starts with taking action and then you start seeing results. Use your parents as motivation and honestly try to change your mindset. At the end of the day, it isn't what happened to you that hurts the most, it's the way you **think** about what happened to you that causes the most pain. \n\nI wish you well!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvar65/i_fucking_hate_myself_please_help_me_be_the/gck0y5i/"}
