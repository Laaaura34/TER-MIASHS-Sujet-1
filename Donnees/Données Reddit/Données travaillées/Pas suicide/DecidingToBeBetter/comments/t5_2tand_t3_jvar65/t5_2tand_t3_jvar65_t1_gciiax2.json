I\u2019ve struggled with depression for a really long time and the one thing that always keeps me going is my family (primarily being my brother who is my best friend). I\u2019m here to talk if you ever feel up for it. I\u2019m not a religious person but I will keep you in my thoughts. Loss is so hard and it takes a long time to heal from something like that- don\u2019t be hard on yourself for not being able to just get over it, it will take time. Just try to focus on your own happiness- it\u2019s okay to take a break from school to focus on your mental health. Reach out to your teachers, they will have so much respect and empathy  for you once you let them know what you\u2019re going through. You are human and others will understand your pain and work with you. Your pain does not make you weak, it makes you human.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvar65/i_fucking_hate_myself_please_help_me_be_the/gciiax2/"}
