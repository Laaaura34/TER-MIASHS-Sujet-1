But truthfully that is only coming from yourself, and thinking like this is adding a bunch on stress and pressure to your life.  You\u2019re grieving and we\u2019re also going through a pandemic it\u2019s ok if you\u2019re not achieving massive goals right now.  Would your sister care more about you achieving things or would she care more about your happiness and well being? Wouldn\u2019t your sister already be proud of you for doing what you could to help your parents get through this difficult time ? \n\nYou\u2019re being so hard on yourself and you\u2019re putting yourself through guilt you don\u2019t need to feel.  I know it\u2019s so unfair that this happened to her, but you should know it is ok for you to live and enjoy your life. I repeat it\u2019s ok for you to live and enjoy your life. It\u2019s also ok for you to take the time you need to grieve and feel whatever emotions come with that. \n\n  Also, I was myself very nihilistic and something that  helped me with loss and depression was learning more about stoicism. It\u2019s not a religion is a philosophy of life and maybe it could help you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvar65/i_fucking_hate_myself_please_help_me_be_the/gcipkpo/"}
