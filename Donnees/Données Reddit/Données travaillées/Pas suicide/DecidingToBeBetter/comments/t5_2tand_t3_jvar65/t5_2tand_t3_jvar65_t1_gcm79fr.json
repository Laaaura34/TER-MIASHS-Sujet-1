If we try to skirt it, bury it or put up a fa\u00e7ade as if everything is okay and we are unaffected, that pain will bleed out into our lives in a multitude of ways. I was raised very religious and in times of true pain, that is what I find myself returning to and as I have aged, it has helped less and less.\n\nWhat I can say that did help was really allowing myself to think and feel about the grief that I felt. How was it affecting me? How is it/has it changed me? Did I gain anything from the loss or did I simply just lose something important to me? Write it all down. It doesn't have to be cohesive, grammatical or pretty. It's for you. It's your catharsis. You can determine to go back and re-read it once, 100 times, or never. You can burn it as soon as you get every, single feeling, thought and ounce of pain out. I'm not going to use any therapy terms like it will give you closure (Although it may); what it will give you is a place to start anew. Then you can determine who are you now and who do you want to be. You can start to build an action plan for your own future and that is helpful in taking the power back for your own life. You can begin to discover yourself again. Get to know your parents again. You all have suffered an intense loss to your lives and to your family structure. Be kind to yourself and move forward at the pace that you are comfortable with, as long as you are moving forward.\n\nTake care of you <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvar65/i_fucking_hate_myself_please_help_me_be_the/gcm79fr/"}
