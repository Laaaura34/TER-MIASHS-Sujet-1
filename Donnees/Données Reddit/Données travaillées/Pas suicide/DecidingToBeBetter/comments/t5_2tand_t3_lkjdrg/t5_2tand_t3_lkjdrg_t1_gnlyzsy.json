Most people are not going to react harshly to another person dropping hints. Don\u2019t go into it thinking terrible things will happen\n\nBesides that, there are little things you can do to see where it goes. For lack of a better term, I think you try to imply a small bit of intimacy (very very small) - touching someone\u2019s arm, wishing them sweet dreams, asking them to text you to make sure they get home okay. I think those hints kick it up just enough of a notch to test the waters without going too far. It will help you feel more comfortable and very likely won\u2019t cause a big reaction if the person isn\u2019t interested.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkjdrg/finally_successfully_asked_someone_out_out_on_a/gnlyzsy/"}
