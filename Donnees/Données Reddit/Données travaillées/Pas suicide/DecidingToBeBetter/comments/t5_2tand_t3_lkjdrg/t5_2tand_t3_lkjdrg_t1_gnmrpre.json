For context of the dating scene I\u2019m in, I\u2019m a ~20 year old girl in college. I\u2019ve never even had a boyfriend before. I am really inexperienced with relationships and I\u2019m scared I don\u2019t know what to do or how to act. If I hang out with this guy once every while (were both super busy with classes and work and packed schedules) and we snapchat and text (even just small talk or selfies, sometimes deeper talk like we both are open about our personal issues a bit) almost every day, could that be us just being friends or something more? I genuinely cannot tell if he\u2019s interested. He\u2019s kind and sweet and so cute and smart but I don\u2019t want to get my hopes up!! Sometimes he\u2019ll respond pretty immediately after I snap and we\u2019ll snap back and forth for several snaps, and other times it\u2019ll take him like a whole day to open my snap (I think it\u2019s because he\u2019s a guy and not on his phone as much as me and he\u2019s busy though). But then sometimes he\u2019ll go out of his way to snap me twice in a row, like before I even respond to his first snap he\u2019ll send a second one a bit later. And he\u2019s just really nice and I don\u2019t want to fuck this up. Any advice would be immensely appreciated!! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkjdrg/finally_successfully_asked_someone_out_out_on_a/gnmrpre/"}
