I will bare it in mind when things are getting a bit much over the next few weeks. I've started a mood tracker in a journal I have today, so that I can have an external view of how I'm doing day by day. \n\nMy husband has been nothing but supportive and has been nagging me about seeing someone for a long time now. I think he's relieved that I'm finally willing to admit I need some help. And everyone I've spoke to so far just today, from the GP to the mental health service and to you kind strangers on Reddit, have all been incredibly kind and understanding. Much different then what the 'what have you got to be depressed about?' upbringing I had lead me to believe it would be like. Thank you and returning love too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ahajia/after_a_huge_break_down_this_i_have_finally_been/eedfobo/"}
