I had a very similar experience with my GP. He took my appointment after they closed and was there with me for two hours while I cried and talked through everything. For a while I saw him once every two weeks. I've been on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds since.\n\nI have seen counsellors, psychiatrists and my doctor, that GP was the most help to me out of all of them. Keep trying professionals until you find the right one for you, maybe talking to your GP will be the best like it was for me. Slowly but surely things get better. Just hold on and keep fighting. I'm proud of you for taking this first step!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ahajia/after_a_huge_break_down_this_i_have_finally_been/eed1bpp/"}
