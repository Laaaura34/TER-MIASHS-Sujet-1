The difference is that you only have access to your own thoughts on this and not what everyone around you is thinking. \n\nWhen I was young, I always thought everyone, especially the adults in my life, were so confident and sure of themselves. As I got older, I kept waiting for this feeling to come to me. Eventually, I realized that no one has anything figured out. Everyone goes through what you're going through. We're all just faking it throughout our lives. It's natural and human.\n\nFinding passion is hard. My suggestion here is to put yourself in new situations and eventually passion will find you. Join a club. Volunteer. Go to an event. Start a conversation with someone at these things. I know these things aren't really possible right now, but keep them in mind for when they are. If you do go to college, it can be a wonderful place for these things.\n\nIf it is possible for you, a therapist that you see regularly can be very helpful. It has been for me.\n\nI hope this helped, and if not, I hope someone else does. Best of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ilwt2a/i_need_advice_on_how_to_respect_myself/g3vdobl/"}
