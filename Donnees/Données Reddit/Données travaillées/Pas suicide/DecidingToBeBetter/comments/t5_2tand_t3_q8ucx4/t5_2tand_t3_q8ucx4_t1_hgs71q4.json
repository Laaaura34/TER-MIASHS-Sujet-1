I was in your position at 25 (almost 28 now). Dropped put of my PhD program and came home. Was jobless for a while and had no confidence at all. After a little professional help and a few short-lived jobs and internships, I'm currently working in a half-decent place that pays well and I'm working on becoming a freelance science/medical editor because I miss science. \n\nYou had a plan. That plan didn't work out. It's not the end of the world. Take a step back, get some help, and keep moving forward. You're absolutely not alone in this and it's NOT too late for you. Not by a long shot. You have your whole life ahead of you and the possibilities are endless. We're all here cheering you on!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgs71q4/"}
