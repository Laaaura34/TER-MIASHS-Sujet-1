Turns out I was suffering from \"Imposter Syndrome\" where I always felt like I was dumb, and it's only a matter of time before everyone else figured it out too.  Anxiety and depression through the roof.  Kept me from doing what I wanted, and my happiness.\n\nI'd recommend seeing a professional, and talk out these feelings that you are experiencing.  The only thing holding you back from doing what you want to do is yourself.  There is no gate keeper.  You're doing that.\n\nGood luck going forward OP!\n\nAlso to answer your question.  No, it's not too late!!! It's never too late.  25 is young!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgrq8r6/"}
