BUT l wanted to comment on the other part of your post. (Forget about your age) your \u201cdream life\u201d sounds a lot like a fantasy of being a scientist philosopher\u2026.is that really what you want to do? Wake up at dawn and drink a pot of coffee. Stay up till 2 am talking to your friends about the finer points of some new philosophy? Sounds to me a lot like the people over in the writing forums (myself included sometimes) who dont want to write a book as much as they want to fantasize about being a famous author. Which are oddly two different things. Don\u2019t fall in love with what you \u201cthink\u201d your life will look like if you get X schooling. \n\nIf you want to have the life you describe, maybe start waking up at 5am everyday. If nothing else you will get more done than the average person, or at least have more time to think about the perfect life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgtc5v3/"}
