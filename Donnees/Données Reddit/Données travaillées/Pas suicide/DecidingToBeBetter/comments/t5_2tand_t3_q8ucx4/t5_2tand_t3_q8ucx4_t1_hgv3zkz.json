I learnt my those two lessons the hard way.\n\nIf u have confidence issues, do baby steps. Overcome that mental barrier and give things a try . It doesn't have to be much, just a little bit everytime, and more every next time. Confidence doesn't come overnight.\n\nAdditionally, dont get too worked up on plans. Don't stress too much on it. Just cuz things didnt go as planned doesnt mean u still dont end up where u wanna be. Sometimes life takes u on strange detours so u can learn what u need to learn, and experience what u need to experience, in order to become the person that u wanna be.\n\nExample: U wanna be a scientist and do research all day long. But what do u wanna research? Have u truly found what it is that u are so passionate about that u wanna spend ur all day everyday researching this? If not, get out there and explore. U'll never know until u really go out there and explore.  \n\n\nLike i said, never say never, and nothing is ever too late.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgv3zkz/"}
