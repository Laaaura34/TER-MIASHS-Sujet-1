I believe that a lot of people go through the same crisis as you are going through and since it's a very intimate crisis and no one can help you out here, you feel that you are the only one going through this. \n\nYes, you'll have to go through this alone, but you are not the only person going through this. \n\nAnd no, it's not too late. Rather, it's early. It's earlier than your 30s or your 40s. Imagine going halfway through your life and them realizing that this is not what you were looking for.
