I\u2019m 25. I have a degree in history, 3/4 of a nursing degree, both of which I\u2019ll never use and two children, a modeling career that is already well behind me. I desperately wanted to go to art school my whole life. My life went so fast in a few years and I\u2019m having a serious crisis, the same one you\u2019re having, I was having a few weeks ago. You and I have actually achieved a lot more than most people our age. But we still feel worried, because I guess we are beginning to face the expectation of adulthood in its genuine sense. I also suffer from the same confidence issues which makes me more anxious about all of this, I\u2019m working on it though.\n\nMy husband is nearly 50. He is a very successful professor and author. When I had this \u201cbreakdown\u201d over the course of those weeks, he kept reminding me that at 25, he had the Scandinavian variant of an associates degree in a completely unrelated field, and was basically sitting at his moms house and smoking cigarettes and reading books all day, partying all night. Then he went and decided to study his actual passion, English. Then he kept going, got his doctorate. He did it all pretty quickly once the ball was rolling, but he probably wouldn\u2019t have done a very good job if he started at 19 like other people around him. He wouldn\u2019t be where he is today. His point is that, 25 is not fucking old, it\u2019s when life is just starting, and there is NOTHING wrong with inventing or finding yourself at any age, but 25 really is not old, but old enough to begin to have a more focused vision. In his perspective, this is a huge advantage. When he told me this I cried with joy realizing this is the reality! I still get anxious or nervous about finally living my passion, if I\u2019m too old, if I\u2019m doing the right thing etc. but then I remember this advice! \n\nI\u2019m going to go to art school now :) \n\nIt\u2019s just NEVER too late and my friend, we are SO YOUNG. We will look back on this and be so happy we made the decision to live authentically so early!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgsrwj9/"}
