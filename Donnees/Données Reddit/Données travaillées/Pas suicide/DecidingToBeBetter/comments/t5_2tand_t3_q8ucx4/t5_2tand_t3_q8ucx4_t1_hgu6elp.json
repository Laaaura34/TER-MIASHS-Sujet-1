It\u2019s easy to find people who have their shit together more than you feel you do if you look around for that. A lot of those people don\u2019t have plans either though. A lot of them just fall into a job, do what their families tell them to do, etc. Very few people have concrete plans for the next 5 years. Even fewer have plans that actually work out. If you enroll in school right now you\u2019ll be 29 when you get your undergrad. I had plenty of people in their 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s in classes with me all throughout undergrad. It\u2019s really not a big deal. I don\u2019t know how so many people got it in their heads that you have to have your entire life figured out when you\u2019re like 23.
