I can relate to every single word and have had the same thoughts many, many times. If it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m a few months older than you and started feeling the way you are when I was 23. I laid the groundwork to get my life changed around by 24. Now at 25, I\u2019m not where I want to be but I\u2019m headed in the right direction, and that\u2019s all I can ask for.\n\nMost people *don\u2019t* have it figured out by 25! A lot of people don\u2019t even have things figured out into they\u2019re well into their 30\u2019s or 40\u2019s, so don\u2019t worry about just figuring out what you want to do at age 25.
