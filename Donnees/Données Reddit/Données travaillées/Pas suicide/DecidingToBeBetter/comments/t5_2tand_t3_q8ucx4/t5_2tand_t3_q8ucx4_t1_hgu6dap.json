I will be 35 soon. Life takes people on different roads. Some had shitty childhood and ended up dead because of drugs. Others had the luck and perseverence to become Kevin Hart or Mike Tyson. There is people 70+ finishing university degrees. Just do what you want to do. Age dont matter. Can you do it? Yes? Do it. Cant? Why not? Can you try? Yes? Do it.\n\nFor some things there is too late. Like I cant be a professional football player or an astronaut now. But there is many other ways I can take. Sometimes we spend too much on what we cant rather than on what we can. Took me a while to figure that one out. :D\n\nGood luck to you! And indeed, its a marathon, not a sprint.
