It is probably because around your late 20s is when all your peers have had a little bit of time to discover themselves and become successful, so it makes one feel insecure when they don't feel like they are measuring up. But I do wish that as a society we didn't put so much glory and emphasis around becoming ultra successful in your 20s. It's ridiculous to think that it's too late to improve your life, especially when you're still in your 20s!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgsik7v/"}
