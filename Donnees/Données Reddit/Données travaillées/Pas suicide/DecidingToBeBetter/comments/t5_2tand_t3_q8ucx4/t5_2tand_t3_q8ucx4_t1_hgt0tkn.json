I studied phys/chem/bio at school loved them, got early entry into a computer science degree but I was worried I wasn't smart enough to even try. So at the last minute I picked a digital media degree as I did have some interest in that as well.\n\nI enjoyed it but still had thoughts of inadequacy, and in my last semester of this 3 year degree I dropped out as my anxiety flared and I started having that existential crisis. For the last 6-7 years I've just been working in retail. Managed to get into a bit of a management role but other than that haven't progressed with anything.\n\nMy anxiety constantly flared and I was depressed often. I am currently 28, and attempting to fight my anxiety to contact the university to see if I can complete that degree I never finished, so at least I can have that degree under my belt. And from what I've heard even if you're looking at a job unrelated to your degree, just having one can help.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgt0tkn/"}
