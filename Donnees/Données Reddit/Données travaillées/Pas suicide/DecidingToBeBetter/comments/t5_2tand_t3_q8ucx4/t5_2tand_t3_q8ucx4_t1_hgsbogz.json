But I understand the struggle. I'll be only 22 soon and I also have the feeling that I'm not where I'm supposed to be and it's tough, even at a young age. But you still have a lot of time. You're in the perfect age to try something new or to switch carriers completely. It's not gonna be the easiest (I mean a completely new field of study, explaining to family and friends, getting used to studying again) but lots of people have done it! It's manageable. I wish you luck and I hope you'll find your place soon.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgsbogz/"}
