They're not looking for the 'get drunk and party' scene and they likely don't have time for more than like one club that really speaks to them, maybe. Almost all will be working. As you say, most older students will attend classes and either spend the rest of the time in the library/dedicated study spaces or go home or to work. Some may not even attend ALL classes, depending on work and their existing grasp of the subject.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgs68xs/"}
