There was the stuck in restaurants phase, then basic office phase, the low-level IT phase, then slightly better IT level phase. I'm 51 and have 3 completed degrees. I don't feel done yet. If life was over at 25, I would have killed myself. Instead, a decent life didn't start for me until about age 36. Now I don't worry about it. There may be people with higher titles than mine, but I like my life right now, and keep adding in new things. Like this weekend I'll be starting my first real woodworking project that doesn't entail some kind of \"slop it together\" for some function. I'm making wood beer steins.  \n\nMy mom didn't start her last career until she was 53. \n\nMy little sister went through a few as well, and is now looking at what will coast her into retirement (I'll probably be working until I can't any more). \n\nThe people who truly \"make it\" in life are adaptable. Those who pick one thing when young and refuse to do anything else but that one thing eventually find themselves fighting for the last few remaining jobs after they are either changed or outsourced. Life and books are pretty similar in that some character development and changes are what make it good.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgt2grb/"}
