You\u2019re not actually absorbing what is being said.  You\u2019re just saying what you feel.  \n\nI did not say you made her.  Neither did she.  But she felt pressured.  She had a history of abuse.  You told her you could support or have a kid and she took that seriously.  No one is saying you\u2019re a bad person, but you\u2019re definitely not growing from this.  She wanted the baby and you didn\u2019t.  You\u2019re not evil, but she regrets her decision and now she has to live with it.  She\u2019ll probably never forgive you, but there\u2019s nothing that can be done about it.\n\nBeing supportive is way more than about money and having a job.  Clearly you weren\u2019t there for her enough emotionally.  You may have been doing your best, but sometimes that isn\u2019t enough.  That\u2019s not a jab at you.  There\u2019s a quote I love from Star Trek that says \u201cIt is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.\u201d  You may have done your best, but it wasn\u2019t enough for her, and that\u2019s ok.  Now you owe it to yourself to grow from both of your mistakes and move forward in your life.  Just don\u2019t contact her and move on with your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n6fxnt/she_wrote_me_8_months_later/gx7gotf/"}
