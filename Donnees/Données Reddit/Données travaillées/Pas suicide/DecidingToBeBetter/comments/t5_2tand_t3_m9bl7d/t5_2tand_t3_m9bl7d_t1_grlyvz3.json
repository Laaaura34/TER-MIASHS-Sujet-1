I think often I was trying to achieve goals to prove I was good enough to someone. \n\nAfter graduating college I started trying to improve myself for myself. However, I still carried over that \"I'm not good enough, I need to keep trying to harder mentality.\"\n\nOne day during a session, my therapist said, \"What, can you not feel two things at once? Why is that so wrong?\" (I really dig his style because he is challenging in what seems to be a very genuine way. ) So basically, give yourself permission to feel both things. Feeling that you are enough does not negate the feeling that you should continue to strive for improvement and vice versa. It won't \"make\" you complacent, in fact it should make you want to work harder to be better because you accepted that you are worthy of better. \n\nTake a minute today to indulge in all the awesome things you already are and have done!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m9bl7d/striving_for_self_improvement_while_feeling_like/grlyvz3/"}
