I think it is a fair boundary to set. Is it normal in your family to talk about eachother's eating habits, bodies, weight gain and weight loss? Of course, you should return the courtesy as well and keep your unhelpful thoughts and feelings about their habits and their bodies to yourself.\n\nYou could say that you know what foods and what amounts make you feel good and healthy, and that they might be trying to be supportive but those types of comments are generally unhelpful and triggering for you. \n\nIt will take time for them to stop commenting, and feeling entitled to talking about your body or your diet.
