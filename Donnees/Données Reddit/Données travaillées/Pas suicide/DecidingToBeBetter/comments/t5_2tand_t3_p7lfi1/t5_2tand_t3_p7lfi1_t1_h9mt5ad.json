I'm apprehensive about finding a good therapist. I have had 2 experiences with therapy and they didn't go well but that was a long time ago... I should try again.\n\nI am not really feeling guilty about hooking up in France (maybe I should and I'm a bitch). I just felt ashamed I was so blind to his pain before. He was trying to pull away from me while I was getting more and more comfortable with him and actually being exclusive. He doesn't expect me to be \"exclusive\" and faithful to him. Just honest about where I am and not lie to him. He said I could do whatever I wanted while I'm away but he doesn't want to know about it. So I will not tell him about my hookups unless he asks about them. That's kind of the arrangement we came to before we went on vacation. I guess when he finds he can't take this, he'll break up with me if not sooner. Or maybe I should do it right away and be done with it and stay alone. That's where my comfort zone is anyway.\n\nAs for masturbation, as a female, it only makes me want it even more. masturbation takes a long time for me and it just builds my drive up higher, it doesn't give me the \"release\" effect... quite the opposite..", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7lfi1/27f_struggling_to_learn_how_to_function_on_the/h9mt5ad/"}
