So take everything with a grain of salt. I'm just an internet stranger giving my opinion and hopefully reasonable advice.) \n\nI don't know a lot about how females experience \"post nut clarity\" but it can help you maybe if you masturbate before dates or heck maybe even before getting on tinder.\n\nI cannot advice on whether or not to tell your steady military guy about your hook ups in France but if you do feel guilty about it you probably should tell him and maybe discuss an (semi) open relationship. He doesn't seem the type to be on board with that though.\n\nI assume that the infatuation will probably fade before you go back to next Summer. If not maybe try deleting Tinder off of your phone. Sometimes I can always just spend a lot of time on apps like tinder just because I'm bored, this may sound really stupid but retirement homes always have a lot of bored old people and they always appreciate someone new younger to play games wit, tell their stories of which they have a lot of or listen to yours! \n\nObligatory therapy comment here\nTry talking it out RL for a few sessions to a therapist they will be able to help you out a little bit or at least reduce your anxiety about the situation or at the very least you'll be able to get your words out to a real person because sometimes social media can feel like talking to a wall, at least for me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7lfi1/27f_struggling_to_learn_how_to_function_on_the/h9l5lhk/"}
