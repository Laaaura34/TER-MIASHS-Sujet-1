Some people don't care about monogamy but for those who do it is a big deal, so if you made it clear that that was your expectation, then yes, what he did was quite simply wrong. And it was still wrong even if you perhaps did not bear it like a perfect martyr.\n\nOnce a cheater, always a cheater. Move on, OP.  There are guys out there who respect monogamy. It is matters to you, go find yourself one.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxxjue7/"}
