When I heard that in a breakup, usually the dumpee has the advantage because they launch themselves into self-improvement, whereas the dumper tends to feel justified in their decision so do nothing to self-reflect\u2014I see now this is true.\n\nYour second paragraph is gold. Absolutely what I was feeling, but thought maybe I\u2019m quite selfish to think about him in this way.\n\nTo be fair to him, he really did put a lot if effort into \u201crighting his wrong\u201d, and that gave me a weird sense of power. I enjoyed the imbalance as it was to my advantage. Sk I do acknowledge I became toxic and he was right to cut it.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t understand his role in the downfall at all. I feel like I\u2019m taking *all* the blame.\n\nAnyway, you\u2019re right, we\u2019ll likely it get back together due to this.
