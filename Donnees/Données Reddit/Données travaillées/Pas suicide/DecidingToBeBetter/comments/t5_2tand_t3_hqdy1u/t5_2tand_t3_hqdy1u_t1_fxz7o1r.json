That's very kind of you to say. I typically go straight to the soul, which makes me generally unlikeable (if I was wiser and humbler, I'd better tailor my approach to each person's capacity for hearing truth - though that's less applicable in a place like this), so you should pat yourself on the back rather than me for being able to be touched by this. \n\nBut, if you think I'm insightful... then you should read more, preferably away from the hive-mind of Reddit :p The history of philosophy, mythology and spirituality has so much more in every way. I can give recommendations if you give me a clue.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxz7o1r/"}
