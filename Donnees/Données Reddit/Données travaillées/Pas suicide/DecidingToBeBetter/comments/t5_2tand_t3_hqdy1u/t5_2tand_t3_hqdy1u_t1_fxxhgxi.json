Strenuous demands on your time but no sense of respect for it either? Hypersensitivity to criticism? Infidelity? Even if this person had a past with you and changed or whatever, your relationship with him is over. You do not owe him a second chance, nor do you have to be nice about it.\n\nTo me it seems disrespectful to yourself to hang around someone dragging you down so hard. \n\nRun for the hills.
