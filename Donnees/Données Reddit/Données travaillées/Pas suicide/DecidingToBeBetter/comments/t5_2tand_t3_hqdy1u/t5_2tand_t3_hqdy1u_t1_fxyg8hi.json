Or at least husband material???\n\nThis guy isn't it. OBVIOUSLY!! \n\nNobody likes to be told what to do, or else. And my advise to ALL WOMEN is don't try and change a Man after you got him. \"He's so great, except for this or that\"  A Man is who he is. Definitely don't marry him if you want to change him. \nMy suggestion is... your young, there are plenty of fish in the sea. Keep your standards high and have fun. \nPlease drop all the self criticism, it doesn't matter!!!\nI have had my share of relationships and when I was ready to settle down, I found the right guy 27 yrs ago. Is he perfect? NO. Am I? NO..... but we try to make each day nice for each other. \n\nThat's how you move forward.....", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxyg8hi/"}
