This unfortunately is how NPD people operate and manipulate you into being what they want which is narcissistic supply. \n\n\nI would do research into Narcissistic Personality Disorder and see how your boyfriend\u2019s behaviors line up with the description.\n\n\nI would also read the book,\u201dWhy does he do that?\u201d by Lundy Bancroft. This was my book to help me break free from my NPD ex and realize that I deserve better as do you.  \n\n\nNo one needs people like this in their life. \n\n\nPM me if you need any additional advice. \n\n\nBest of luck to you and many blessings on your path.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxxundl/"}
