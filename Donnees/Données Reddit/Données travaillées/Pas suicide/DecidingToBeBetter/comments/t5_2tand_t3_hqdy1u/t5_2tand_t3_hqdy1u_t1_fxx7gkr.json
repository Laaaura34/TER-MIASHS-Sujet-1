He acts disrespectfully, both directly and through invalidating your feelings. And he\u2019s acting selfishly, taking what he wants and acting how he wants with no regard for your feelings, then discrediting those feelings when you express them.\n\nHis behavior is selfish and disrespectful; and, instead of truly working on it, he\u2019s tired of the pressure and is cutting you down instead. He\u2019s probably not ready for a real relationship, one with give-and-take and cooperation. \n\nYou said y\u2019all were broken up now, so I wouldn\u2019t put too much stock in his opinions of you. They\u2019re a reaction to expecting more from him, and they\u2019re an attempt to hurt you. \n\nMaybe he was right to a certain degree, maybe in the end you WERE nagging too much. But it was you trying to find an equal partner and a little respect for yourself, and his behavior might not have brought out the best in you. I\u2019d just move on and find someone less wrapped up in themselves, someone who does bring out the best in you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxx7gkr/"}
