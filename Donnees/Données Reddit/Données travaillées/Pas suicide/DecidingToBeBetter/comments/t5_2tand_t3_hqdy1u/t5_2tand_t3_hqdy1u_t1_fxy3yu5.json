So as specific as it seems to you, i think these issues are more common than most thing.  Additionally, from my experience almost everyone (especially on the internet) seems to dissuade and almost punish the person that goes back to a non-loyal partner and generally most people believe that people cannot change.\n\nI used to be one of those believers, in a very strong sense.  But once this situation occured in my life, i realized that people actually can change but they have to WANT it.  all of it, not just some of it.  And i also realized i had issues myself.  I still go to therapy to work on myself (and my depression) but also to work on my communication skills and weaknesses in relationships.   He actually goes to therapy too, and we're still together.  It's been crazy, and easily the most difficult relationship in my entire life.  But so far it's worth it.  However, like i said, in order to change, the person themselves has to want it.  I didn't used to think i needed it, but i realized i had issues and decided to be better.  I think a similar thought happened in his brain.  We're not doing it for each other, but for ourselves.\n\nIt does sound like in your situation he was only changing for you, not truly, genuinely for him.  I suppose that's my only comment towards your situation.  I totally analyse things at this level, so i get it.  Keep working on you, it's a lifelong challenge. #respect", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxy3yu5/"}
