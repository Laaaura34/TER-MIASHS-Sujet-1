Same as mine. It\u2019s nothing to do with you, just so you know. He has major self-esteem issues and the number of people who give him validation is what fuels him, bot the frequency. You could be telling him he\u2019s the king of the jungle every second, but you\u2019ll still be just \u201cone\u201d girl, in comparison to the fleet of women he could be getting these comments from.\n\nYou\u2019re right in that it ultimately would have ended the same. \n\nWell it really sounds like you need to let it go, sister. I know the feeling of holding on til the very last drop (I do that with my tubes of toothpaste lol), but you\u2019re accepting crumbs in the meantime. It seems like you\u2019re going into the \u201cmartyr\u201d mentality of \u201cI am sacrificing my wellbeing for the good of the relationship\u201d, when it seems like all you\u2019re doing it letting yourself get beaten down. And the more worn down you are, the less likely you\u2019ll be to leave. He probably knows that too.\n\nPlease take care of yourself first, and do what you need to do for *you*. There is no reward for being a martyr, but there is happiness in cherishing yourself!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxxlchz/"}
