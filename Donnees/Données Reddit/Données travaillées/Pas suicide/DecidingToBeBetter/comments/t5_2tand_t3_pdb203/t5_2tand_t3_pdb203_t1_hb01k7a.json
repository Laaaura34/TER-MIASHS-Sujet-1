Yeah they do have pensions.\n\nI also went to a really top school so I \"feel like\" I should be out there trying. Lots of people I know work at start ups and such putting their brains to the work. But clearly there's a reason why I'm in this job-- I guess it fits me in being secure/stable good work balance, but I want to try again sometimes. Maybe it's just a dream. I almost 'know for certain' I won't stay in this position more than a few years, maybe I'll stay in gov't.\n\nPeople have told me: there are people who want to work here, and there are people who want to work at Google, amazon, etc. Those people work overtime and there's a lot of pressure. And to be honest, I don't know which is which. \n\nI guess generally I like the stable, I don't like working more, etc, but there are times I do a lot.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdb203/start_looking_for_another_job/hb01k7a/"}
