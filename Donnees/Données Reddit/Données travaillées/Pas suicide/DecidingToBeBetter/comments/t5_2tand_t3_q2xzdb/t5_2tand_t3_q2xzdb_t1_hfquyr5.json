I found myself having the same problem, just spiralling and feeling unable to maintain a calorie deficit.\n\nI think tracking is really helpful as a start, even if you can't maintain a strict diet right now. Over time, I've found that it has helped me reduce the number of calories that I'm over budget by - so even on weeks where I've probably gained weight, I'm at least gaining it a little less slowly. And I'm under budget more often than I was before I started tracking. I find a lot of people will tell you to eat at an insane deficit like 1200 calories a day (particularly if you're female) but even eating a little less can help you get into the right mindset.\n\nI'm still working on it but I think I'm on the right track.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2xzdb/how_to_i_stop_myself_from_spiraling_into_obesity/hfquyr5/"}
