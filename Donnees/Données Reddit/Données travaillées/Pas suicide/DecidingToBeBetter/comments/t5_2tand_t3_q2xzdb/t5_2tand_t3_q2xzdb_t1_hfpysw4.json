I'm not going to do that for you over the internet. So first of all don't make assumptions about my education.\n\nSecond of all, your one study is really cute. There are hundreds studies out there that show that the covid vaccine is dangerous etc. But guess what? The vaccine works and is not dangerous.\n\nThere's a reason we have health agencies that make guidelines, otherwise every other joe shmoe out there can find a study to \"prove\" whatever they want, especially by misinterpreting scientific articles. \n\nObesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, covid death, malignancy, and a million other things. Please. Stop. Spreading misinformation to make OP feel ok about mistreating his body when they are asking for help stopping it. You're telling him it's ok for what? Because it makes you feel better? It's not healthy and it never will be healthy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2xzdb/how_to_i_stop_myself_from_spiraling_into_obesity/hfpysw4/"}
