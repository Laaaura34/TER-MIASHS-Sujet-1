He doesn\u2019t care about you, so why should you? Block him off everything, delete every trace of him, turn your attention away from it, and put all of your energy into becoming the best version of yourself. \n\nSports, travel, blogs, networking events, school, work, hobbies, entrepreneurship, the gym \u2014 the list goes on for what you can focus your energy towards. You may read this list and think that it\u2019s clich\u00e9 or whatever \u2014 but there is so much more dimension to it when you actually do these things than read them in theory.\n\nYou can\u2019t control others\u2019 actions. You make a desperate fool of yourself for asking a non-partner not to sleep with someone else. Trust me, I\u2019ve been there and it was an ugly time.\n\nAsk yourself this: why am I giving a damn about ONE person? Over 7 billion people on this Earth, life ahead of you, so many opportunities and great people around \u2014 and I\u2019m upset over one person I\u2019m not even with!?\n\nYou\u2019ll be blown away when you realize how foolish you are for caring about this one unimportant person, once you get out, meet greater people, and do great things.\n\nLastly, \n\u2022 Don\u2019t ever invest all of your emotions into one person, especially quickly\n\u2022 Find something that gives you confidence\n\nThe decision to move on starts with YOU. All you have to do is decide what you\u2019ll do to move on, and take action.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d5efrv/i_will_not_cry_over_him_again/f0li2ze/"}
