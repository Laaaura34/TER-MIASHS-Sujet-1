I started going to a boxing gym and now I take boxing classes 2-3 times/week. Find something you really click with (pilates, yoga, swim aerobics, zumba, whatever), try it out once (they usually offer the first class for free) and then it becomes MUCH easier and MUCH more fun. plus, now that I\u2019m a regular in the class I have begun making friends with people and it becomes like a fun group workout! \n\nHope this helps:)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fcg03o/how_do_i_find_the_motivation_to_workout/fjc67fd/"}
