Be that in friendships, romantic relationships, or creative work. I don't even know what it feels like for me to be that to someone else. That's what I'm failing at.

There's nothing more I can do with my life without succeeding in subjectivity in some way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/madmt0/my_entire_life_ive_hated_that_so_much_is/grstrdx/"}
