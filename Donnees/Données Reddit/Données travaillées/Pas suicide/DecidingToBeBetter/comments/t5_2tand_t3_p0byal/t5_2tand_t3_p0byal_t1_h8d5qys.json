I don\u2019t just sit around i try an see what i can do but never find anything. So i end up going hammocking and reading a book but i associate that with being a loser because i\u2019m by myself :( Ever since i was a kid the thought of being by myself always seemed so sad so i forced relationships and got very emotional in them. that emotion turns into a needy feeling to be funny, when you try to be funny you never are it seems.
