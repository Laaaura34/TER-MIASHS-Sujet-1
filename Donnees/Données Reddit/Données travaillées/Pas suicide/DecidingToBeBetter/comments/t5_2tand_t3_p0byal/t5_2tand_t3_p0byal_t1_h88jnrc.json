I see a lot of myself in your post and promise, you are going to be ok.  I recommend talking to someone who may even want you to consider medicine (which is totally ok!!!) to help you cope/find a calmer place. It\u2019s an awesome world out there and you have so much left so explore and experience. You\u2019ll find your groove and group of friends/a partner and it will all feel easy.
