I hammock and read a book every day after work. Just moved to a new city and have no friends here. You should read a book called Becoming Supernatural if you\u2019re already into reading. I got depressed recently and some of the concepts in that book really turned around my perception of things. He literally talks about how the things you tell yourself become your reality.\n\nI also really recommend getting into lifting. It\u2019s kind of intimidating in the beginning but once you get into the habit it\u2019s awesome. Like I can have a shit day, but if I get a good work out I leave the gym feeling like I just absolutely crushed my day. You get to start doing research and learning about it so you get a whole lifestyle hobby and identity out of it. And right now you\u2019re depressed, but if you get into it and enjoy the process every day, in 5 years you\u2019ll look at yourself in the mirror and remember where you were today and have hard physical evidence of your growth. Idk, I was a nerd in high school and fitness became a huge source of pride that gave me a lot more social confidence. It\u2019s not easy, but it is 100% worth it. There\u2019s a reason there\u2019s so much hype around it", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0byal/i_dont_see_myself_ever_being_happy/h8dc8g9/"}
