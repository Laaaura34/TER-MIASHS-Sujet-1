What about havinf the paranoia of always thinking people are taking things, and losing things, and not being able to understand what people are saying because my brain is lacking behind, i mean i read your post 5 times and still have to go back to remember what you said. I also have thoughts i want to share or want to respond to people and realize i have no idea what i\u2019m talking about, an that initial thought makes it hard to make good points and put two and two together, for example. I was at the store w girlfriend, read a sign saying \u201cno cash\u201d i saw her pull out cash as she didn\u2019t read the sign. I didn\u2019t even say anything because i didn\u2019t realize it, i was so on edge and felt retarded. It makes it even harder to give advice as i have to use all my brain power. Thank you for your reply, i asked my parents if i ever got tested for adhd when all my teachers believed i had it and they both said they just thought the teachers were full of shit so nothing happened.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0byal/i_dont_see_myself_ever_being_happy/h8dtyh4/"}
