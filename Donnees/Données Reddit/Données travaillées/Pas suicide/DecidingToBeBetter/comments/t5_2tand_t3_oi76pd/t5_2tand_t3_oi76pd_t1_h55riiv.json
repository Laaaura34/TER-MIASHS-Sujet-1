The humble scales, or ballet exercises, that they have done for a lifetime will always show them new things.  So in a way, the masters are always beginners.\n\nHope that makes sense, and I hope I didn't sound like a hardass in my comment.   If I've learned anything in life, it's that there are no shortcuts to true achievement.\n\nBest of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oi76pd/having_trouble_consistently_learning_different/h55riiv/"}
