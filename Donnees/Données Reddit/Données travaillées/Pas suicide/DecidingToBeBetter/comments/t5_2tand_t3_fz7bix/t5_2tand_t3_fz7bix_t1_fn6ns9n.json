I'm 3 years off of everything myself. Had a horrible heroin and cocaine addiction for 7 years (from 20 to 27). Even getting convicted of armed robbery didnt stop me, and to be honest I dont know what eventually kicked in but I slowly began realizing I wanted a better life. I was sick and tired of being sick and tired, as they say in NA. Having a counselor, MMT and a very supportive family gave me the foundation to stay clean. Getting clean was spark in my brain of my past self trying to break through all the bullshit. To anyone who is trying to kick, you need to really WANT it. No excuses or \"tomorrows\". You may not be here for tomorrow.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fz7bix/half_a_decade_clean_from_drugs/fn6ns9n/"}
