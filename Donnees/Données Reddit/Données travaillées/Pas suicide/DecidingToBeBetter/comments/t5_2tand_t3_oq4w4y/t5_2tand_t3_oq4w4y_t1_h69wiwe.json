Yes i workout regulary.\n\nI could pick the place yes, well depends, im all for compromises, if she really hates the place, no worries we can go somewhere else.\n\nAlso it depends, if she needs me to stay, ill do it, but if not and im going with my friends, then ill go.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oq4w4y/am_i_the_problem_in_my_relationshios_or_is_it/h69wiwe/"}
