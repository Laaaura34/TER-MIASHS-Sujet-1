I\u2019m the same way, very loving and giving in relationships. You have just so happened to meet emotionally unavailable people as have I. Learn to see the signs early on so you don\u2019t end up wasting your time and energy, not everyone deserves it. There are people out there who want a partner just like you, believe me. Wait for that right person, it\u2019s worth it. \n\nAnd I understand the frustration with people who are in long term relationships and are terrible to their partners. I see it too and it drives me crazy and makes me wonder why. But just remember, those are toxic, codependent, and unstable relationships and you don\u2019t want to be in something like that. Loving, healthy and stable relationships are the goal.\n\nYou\u2019re young too, it\u2019s better to learn this lesson now rather than later. I\u2019m older than you and only just now realizing my self-worth. It\u2019s all a learning experience and you\u2019re on the right track", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oq4w4y/am_i_the_problem_in_my_relationshios_or_is_it/h6a4aka/"}
