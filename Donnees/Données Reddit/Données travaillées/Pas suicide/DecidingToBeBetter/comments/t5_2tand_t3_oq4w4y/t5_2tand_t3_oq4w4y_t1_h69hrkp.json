You don\u2019t have bad luck. Ending any relationship (friends, lovers, etc) is a difficult process of growing up and maturity.\nBeing vulnerable is not a weakness. It\u2019s a sign of strength, self knowledge and bold decisions. Men should be more open about relationship issues and deep feelings (mental health and STD too, but that\u2019s another subject).\n\nIt happens. Shit happens. You both lose because you\u2019re worthy too.\n\nTry to focus on yourself: go to the gym of do good home workout, study hard, read more books, improve your creativity and art sense...\n\nA lot of people are living decades of unhappy marriages. Your 4 months were your 4 months. Only you and your partner knows. And that\u2019s the magic: who knows what the future expects to you? You are only 22. So so young...\n\nCommunication is a key. Even the non-communication tells us a lot of things.\nHonest opinion? Stay in good terms with you. She has trouble with herself. You can politely talk and respect her decisions. Don\u2019t get stucked in. Allow yourself to feel the sadness and whatever... but move on with your life investing your time and energy in your own life by now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oq4w4y/am_i_the_problem_in_my_relationshios_or_is_it/h69hrkp/"}
