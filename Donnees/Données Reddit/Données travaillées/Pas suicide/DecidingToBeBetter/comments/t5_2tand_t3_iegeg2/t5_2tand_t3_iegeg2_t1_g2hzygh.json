It\u2019s hard not to take it personally. But this person was just constantly reminded of really traumatic things I was there for/helped her through and she just couldn\u2019t fully recover without entirely cutting ties. \n\nSometimes you need to shut the door before you can move on to the next room. I feel a lot of peace knowing she\u2019s doing well enough that she wanted to shut that door. It sucks. A lot. She was a really good friend. But I\u2019m happy to sort of \u201cadmire from afar\u201d and see her so much happier than she used to be. I think that\u2019s what true friends do. They let you chase your happiness whether it means they get to come along or not.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iegeg2/a_friend_broke_up_with_me_and_asked_for_no/g2hzygh/"}
