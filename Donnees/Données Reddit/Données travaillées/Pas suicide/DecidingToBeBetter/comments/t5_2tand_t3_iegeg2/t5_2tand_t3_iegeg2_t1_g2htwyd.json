In the dream we were reverted back into little kids, even though we hadn't been friends since childhood, and we were playing on a playground together. At some point we got to a tucked away part of the playground, and carved our names next to each other. I never got any closure with this friend in real life and their sudden abandonment really gutted me, but the act of us carving our names together felt like a nice final testament to what we once had. Like, even though we were apart now, it would always remain as proof that were once together. I'm glad our dreams can sometimes help us get the closure we'd never get in real life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iegeg2/a_friend_broke_up_with_me_and_asked_for_no/g2htwyd/"}
