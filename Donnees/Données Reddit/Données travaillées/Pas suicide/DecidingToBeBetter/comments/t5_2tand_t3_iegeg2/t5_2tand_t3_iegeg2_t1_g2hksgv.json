If she feels in some way that not messaging back a group of friends and actually continuing to build on a friendship with people cause yall are all adults and busy, then move on too. It sounds like you're having those same emotions too and she beat you to the punch. My statement to you would be, leave that group to(not as dramatically as her) and move on. If you feel like a group message has that much power over you then you definitely need to make a change it just isnt worth your mental health...Have a happy life.
