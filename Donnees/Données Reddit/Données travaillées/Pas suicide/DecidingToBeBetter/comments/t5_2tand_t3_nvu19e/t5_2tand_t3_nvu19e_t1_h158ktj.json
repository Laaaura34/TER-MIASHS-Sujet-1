Some ppl clean, others pick up a hobby. Repetitive things can be meditative, like cleaning some things or knitting. Plenty of hobbies that can help. Others learn meditation. Others just stay super busy (a coping mechanism but leads to burnout in many). \n\nSome ppl challenge themselves and learn something new. Dance (ballet is fairly rigid and you have to focus so benefit of both a challenge and cannot sit in your thoughts when trying to do all this new at once, its great). Others learn a language, even if only to watch shows or read in that language. \n\nSome get curious and find something new and obscure to them to learn on a surface level. Pinterest can be a great resource for a new hobby or interest you are just exploring. It could be alternative universe or fanfics of things you already like just delving deeper. Theres crafts, and ideas. These can be much more surface exposures in learning as often you\u2019ll gather thoughts and ideas there, more than physically learning like dance or language (although you can learn about those too on Pinterest). \n\nAlso, humor and comedy are good. Reruns of old shows, or watching or listening to comedy shows that you laugh with can help uplift the mood. Singing can do that too. Turn the music up some and sing away for a few songs. Both can release feel good hormones.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nvu19e/support_tips_anything/h158ktj/"}
