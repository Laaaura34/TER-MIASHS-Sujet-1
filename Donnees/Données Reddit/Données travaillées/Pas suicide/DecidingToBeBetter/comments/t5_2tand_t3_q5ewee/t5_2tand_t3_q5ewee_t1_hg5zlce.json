That's basically co-dependence in a nutshell. \n\nLoving yourself can mean a lot of different things. To start with, I think it means feeling how you regardless of how others feel. So let's say you do an amazing 80s side ponytail and are excited to go out and rock it. But someone else comes along and laughs at you and calls you a hot mess.

Loving yourself means doing the things that delight you regardless of what others think.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg5zlce/"}
