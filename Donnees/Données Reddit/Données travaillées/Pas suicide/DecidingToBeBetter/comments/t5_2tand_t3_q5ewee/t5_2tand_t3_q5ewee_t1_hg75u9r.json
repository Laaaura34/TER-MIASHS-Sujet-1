The way you say you love others, live for others, do that for yourself aswell. Be aware that you are as capable and as amazing as the people around you, living for other people is great, but also live for yourself, do the things you love. Theres nothing wrong with also sharing your achievements with people close to you, in fact its a great way to connect sometimes. You'd realize that self love is there when you look at yourself in the mirror and you're happy with who you are and where you are, you don't wanna die and you start valuing your life, looking after your health and yourself. And I just wanna mention that giving people unconditional love is also nice, loving them without expecting anything back, its way more fun to love that way. Honestly I don't know if my advice is good or not, but I just wanted to somehow try to be a help. Goodluck finding for your answers OP!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg75u9r/"}
