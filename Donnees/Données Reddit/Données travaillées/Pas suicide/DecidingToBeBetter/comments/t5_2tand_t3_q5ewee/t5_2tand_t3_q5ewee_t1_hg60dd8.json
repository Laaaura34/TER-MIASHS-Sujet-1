Everyone has very different experiences in life and arent always as giving as it sounds like op may be. Don\u2019t assume others will give you the same love, devotion, friendship, or treatment in general because we each express ourselves in different ways. Loving yourself makes you less dependent on \u201crecieving\u201d the love you expect in return which may never come or may come in different forms.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg60dd8/"}
