I\u2019d set small goals for myself and make sure I achieve them, and the more accountable I am to myself and the more I grow confident that I can achieve the things I want, my overall confidence and self-love grows.\n\nFor example, people work out, get a better body and grow more confident with a totally new attitude but it\u2019s more than just skin-deep, it\u2019s the confidence that comes from knowing you gave your all to achieving this difficult goal that you had to change your lifestyle and yourself for.\n\nAlso try not to talk excessively about your insecurities on your partner. I\u2019ve learned a hard lesson firsthand that they can start off thinking you\u2019re the top of the world but If you keep talking down on yourself, they\u2019re gonna grow to think that as well.\n\nBlock and don\u2019t ever take back that ex and don\u2019t feel the need to be nice or keep him in your life. He wants you to respect yourself more, then show that you respect yourself more than keeping someone like that in your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg700f3/"}
