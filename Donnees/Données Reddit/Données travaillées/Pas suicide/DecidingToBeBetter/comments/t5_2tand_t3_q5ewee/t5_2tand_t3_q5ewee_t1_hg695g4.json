I try to do the next most loving thing I can for myself. Including things that aren\u2019t purely pleasurable. Sometimes the next most loving thing is working out, even if I don\u2019t feel like it because it\u2019s a commitment to my self and my health. Sometimes it\u2019s taking a nap because I can tell it\u2019s what I need. Sometimes it\u2019s ice cream and sometimes it\u2019s salad. I think this approach works better for me because when you really love someone you want not only to be sweet to them but also nurture their growth.  As far as life being lived for others? Being compassionate and generous are wonderful qualities but aren\u2019t as meaningful when done in a transactional way, as a deal to get the love you need. Also, when you are dependent on others to get love then you have a big chance of coming up empty through no fault of your own. I struggle a lot with both of these things and these are thoughts that are helpful to me. I am so happy to have had this opportunity to remind myself that I\u2019m going to be ok if I take care of myself despite how sad I feel right now. I hope that you find some of it helpful as well. Sending lots of love.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg695g4/"}
