This statement kind of sounds like you don't think that you are inherently worthy of love and respect unless you do something to prove that you deserve love.\n\nThis, OP. \n\nIt's about learning to love and validate yourself. When you learn to do that, you will gain confidence as you are happy and content in yourself. \n\nSome things that helped me in my self-love journey was first off just learning to love my \"me-time.\" I would spend time to myself just enjoying my company whether that was taking myself out to lunch, or on a lone adventure. I did affirmations every morning to build my confidence. I practiced more gratitude on a day to day basis. The book \"The Magic\" was a good one to get me started on that-it has exercises you do every day. I learned how to set boundaries with people so I wasn't always bending over backwards for others but also acknowledging and honoring my own needs. Developing a routine to \"show up\" for yourself each day is important...whether it's 15 min or 1 hour. I took time out each day to meditate or do a mindfulness activity. Get outside and active. It will increase endorphins to be in nature and get your body moving, but also good for your mental health. Lastly, it's easy to hold ourselves to high standards and be our own worst critic. No judgemental comments, shaming or negative self-love talk. Be kind to yourself, you are worthy \u2728", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg73meg/"}
