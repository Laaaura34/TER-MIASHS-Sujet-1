You\u2019re here to do great things. Even if that\u2019s just living. Everything about you is unique, and there will never be anyone like you. You are a collection of experiences, thoughts, feelings, genetic code. And you get free will. You get to choose who you want to be and what you want to do and how you want to act. That\u2019s incredible. And think about pups. They don\u2019t think about loving themselves, they think about loving everything around them. I think sometimes us humans get so caught up in being humans. It\u2019s your turn to experience this beautiful world, and the first step to a long life is taking care of yourself -> loving yourself. Don\u2019t forget to live. You get to choose how to make an impact, but that\u2019s just a bonus. Go out there and make an imprint on the world by being you. Embrace everything about you, and around you. Have fun. This is your one chance. You are so valuable.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg7ru45/"}
