It's funny, because I'm someone who \"loves myself\", as weird as that sounds lol.\n\nBut now that you asked clearly HOW, I.. have no idea what to say, actually!\n\nI don't know if this will help, but I guess I can explain how I ended up loving myself?\n\nI'm not going to tell you my whole life story, but basically, it's through my life experience, especially through family. You see, even though my family loves me, they have never truly respected me. I'm the youngest, so for my brothers and parents, my opinions are lesser. For my parents, no matter what I do, it's never good enough - I'm always going to be their baby boy. I choose my friends wisely, so I'm better off in that area, but I still encounter people in my life, that even though they mean well and are nice people, I sometimes see that they don't really give importance to me, my thoughts and feelings.\n\nSo... I guess, in a way, I found out that, no matter how people like or even love you, the person who can BEST love or like you is yourself.\n\nI'm sorry if I presented that in a \"negative light\", I don't even feel it that way. It's just that, it's really how I saw things and kinda triggered in me that I shouldn't be too hard on myself and I should be 100% my biggest fan, through the best and the worst of times - because frankly, nobody else will be a better believer in me, than me.\n\nAgain, that did sound egotistical, but it's really not - if you think about it profoundly, and not just take my words at face value as I type them, ahaha.\n\nI hope you find what you're looking for.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg7gaqw/"}
