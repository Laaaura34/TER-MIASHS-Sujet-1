Knowing the reason why you want to quit is going to keep you motivated not to install the apps back or recover your accounts. The reasons may vary from reduced productivity to negative feelings induced by social media, so I suggest you make why you want to quit very very clear and one day you will be ready to give it all up. And make sure to replace the habit of scrolling through social media with something else like reading productive articles or books, journaling etc. That's what I did and got rid of everything except for Reddit which I sometimes check (only some communites that interest me in my custom feed).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p967xa/theres_one_more_vice_to_get_rid_of_reddit/h9vy87j/"}
