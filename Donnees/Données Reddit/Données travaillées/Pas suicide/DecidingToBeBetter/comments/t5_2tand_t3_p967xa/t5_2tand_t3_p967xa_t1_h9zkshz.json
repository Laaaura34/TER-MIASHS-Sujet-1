Removed the app icon\n\nFacebook is still on my phone and I can launch it from the App Library, but with these two changes, all visual cues to launch it are gone.\n\nA month later I realized I hadn\u2019t launched it once, or even thought about it. It proved to me that I never \u201cchose\u201d to launch Facebook.
