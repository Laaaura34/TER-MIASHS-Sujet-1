I didn't need to ease myself out of them because I wasn't really \"addicted\" to them the way I am addicted to reddit. \n\nI allowed myself to browse on desktop (I hardly ever use my desktop PC) so it cut my usage down 99.9% but I also still had my training wheels on in case I felt like I needed to see something on FB. \n\nQuitting social media was 10x easier than I expected it would have been. I expected this dramatic quit period where I would have cravings and urges and shit the way you see on Netflix documentaries about it. It was stupid easy. \n\nUnfortunately I rerouted all my freed up time I saved by not using social media and redirected it to reddit. \ud83d\ude43 My general mental health is better though, esp being away from FB and Instagram. \n\nMaybe I'll be surprised again with how easy it is to quit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p967xa/theres_one_more_vice_to_get_rid_of_reddit/h9vkes1/"}
