I also feel like I missed out on so much, especially because I was riddled with low self-esteem in college. I always think \u201cman if only I had the confidence I have now back then\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m reading your description and you seem like a pretty cool person who has a great job (wish I had your salary), good looking (so many people want to look like you), and various unique hobbies (you can play instruments, amazing). There are plenty of people who wish they could be like you.\n\nI think it all comes to going within and developing healthy self-esteem. I know it\u2019s such a pain hearing this but u til they invent a time machine, we can\u2019t keep going back in the past. I missed out on relationships, sex, partying, etc but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t still do that now. The idea that our life only matters in our 20s is BS. Don\u2019t let anyone make you feel like 30 is basically death", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8kns9/missed_out_on_my_20s_need_help_on_where_to/h9sfp0y/"}
