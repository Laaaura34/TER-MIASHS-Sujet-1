I know what I need to do but I also know that 1. I'm older and 2. my window of time is shorter. Therefore, I don't have 10-15 years to cruise into who I am like some other people have had. I have a much, much shorter time window. I know I'm going to be meeting and dating people who have more (life) experience than I do and I need some sort of competitive advantage to close that gap.\n\nGranted, it's not like I've done nothing - I've taken drugs, I've partied, I've done all the typical stuff in college - but my 20s were nothing to really write home about. It's one thing to be out on your own on campus as a broke college student. Completely different bag to be out on your own as a young adult your making money.\n\nSo basically, I was thinking about what the best way would be to stuff 10-15 years of (dating) experience in a period of 3-5 years.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8kns9/missed_out_on_my_20s_need_help_on_where_to/h9y1zjc/"}
