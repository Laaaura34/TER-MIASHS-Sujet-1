So there\u2019s always the opposite side to look at. I could have saved myself years of regret by not meeting the people I did in my teens/twenties.\n\nYou\u2019re not running out of time. You have so much time. \n\nIf you want to go dating why don\u2019t you put yourself out there and ask someone on a date that you like? Maybe to do something like a hike and coffee? In my twenties/early thirties I would have loved someone to be so interesting and proactive to ask that instead of the usual drinks in a bar.\n\nSounds like with savings you could start saving for a house. Lots of people don\u2019t get their first place until their late thirties (me included).\n\nAnd hopefully you have budgets and things in place to make sure you\u2019ll not slip back financially.\n\nI wish you luck finding someone decent (if you want a relationship). Make sure you don\u2019t rush in though, the first person who comes along might not be \u201cthe one\u201d and watch out that they treat you decently and don\u2019t take you for granted. You\u2019ve worked hard to get where you are today, just don\u2019t focus on \u201cmistakes\u201d - you\u2019ve been through a lot.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8kns9/missed_out_on_my_20s_need_help_on_where_to/h9ries5/"}
