I recently went through a break up. A case of forbidden love kind of thing. Which made it worse. I think with me opening up to someone and making a real connection is amazing and wonderful but bares major risk. You give it your all. You want them to succeed as well as yourself and become almost selfless. Its risky on the part is not guaranteed to be for eternity but you hope so. So when the bubble busts. Initially its shocking. You are distraught all kind of wild things come to mind but eventually the pain surpasses. And you realise no matter how or what happened. You were grateful for experience and you're better of because of it. I personally believe that transformation in thought and feeling after a break up is the hardest part. Something you've just achieved so congratulations", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m5hjth/10_weeks_after_breakup_and_i_am_only_getting/gr00ouu/"}
