I like space in general.  I like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars.  I like playing guitar and listening to albums on vinyl (I got a collection of about 40 records).\n\nI will admit, a bit after I posted this I kept surfing this subreddit and saw something on meditation.  I tried it out, and it really worked.  I went from feeling like shit to realizing this whole thing was something I couldn't control and I shouldn't dwell on it.  I think I went from running around in circles in my head to stopping, and letting it fade from my mind.  It was a great experience.\n\nI still want to keep the topic open for discussion, though.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2cnbse/what_do_you_guys_do_to_cheer_yourself_up/cjh9e66/"}
