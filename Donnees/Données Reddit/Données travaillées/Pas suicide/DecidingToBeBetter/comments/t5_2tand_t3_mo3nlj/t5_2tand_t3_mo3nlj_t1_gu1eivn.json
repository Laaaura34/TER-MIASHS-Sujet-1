A lot of people pleasers (myself included) struggle with saying \u201cno\u201d because \u201cyes\u201d comes out of ours mouths before we even have time to process the request.

It\u2019s an almost physical discomfort at a thought of possible confrontation and the instant gratification at being praised by someone. \nThe whole self-love seems obvious once you work through the anxiety and underlying trauma. I often struggle distinguishing between my actual needs and the desire to alleviate the anxiety.\nThis comment turned into a bit of a rant.
