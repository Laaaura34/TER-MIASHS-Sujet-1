The Holistic Psychologist on Instagram has a lot of really helpful information on it that helped me get out of this habit. You can take her advice and practice it until it feels natural. \n\nLike practice saying \"sorry, but I don't have time to help you with that right now\" or \"sorry, but I won't be able to help with that\" \n\nPractice *not* comforting someone or worrying about them when they want time alone. If a friend needs to vent urgently, tell them \"I'm sorry, that really sucks and I would love to hear about it but I'm busy right now\" instead of dropping your own responsibilities to help them. \n\nKeep yourself in your seat at gatherings when it's time to get up and clean, because no one else it. Stop giving thoughtful gifts to people who don't return the gesture. Stop listening to people who don't listen to you. \n\nIdk if you actually do these things btw, they are just common examples of what to do.
