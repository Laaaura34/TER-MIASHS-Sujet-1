Of course not!  You'd stand up to the world if you saw them starting to overload themselves to the point of harm.  You'd encourage them to take care of themselves and set their priorities and boundaries.\n\nSo the task before you is to learn to think of yourself in 3rd person and take care of yourself the same way you'd do for your friend.  \n\nNot an easy road, but a necessary one.  It feels wrong.  Surely it's better to put everyone else first is what we tell ourselves.  We tell ourselves we're strong enough to handle it, or others are more important, etc.  But like you've seen - that thinking only ends up burning us out.\n\nSo just like you'd say \"Hey man, can't make it tomorrow, already told X I'd do a favor.\" - you just tell your friends \"Hey man, sorry, can't make it tomorrow, already committed to someone else.\"  No need to tell them the \"someone else\" is yourself.  That's not being a dick.  That's being respectful.  Respectful to your own needs.  Respectful to them because you're taking care of yourself so you CAN be there for them other times.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nqw59z/how_do_i_remind_people_im_human_without_being_a/h0d36t7/"}
