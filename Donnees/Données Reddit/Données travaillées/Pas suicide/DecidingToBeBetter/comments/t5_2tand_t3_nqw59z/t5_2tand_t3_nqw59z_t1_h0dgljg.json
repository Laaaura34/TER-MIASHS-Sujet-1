You're already the path to a more conscious sense of what you want.\n\nI really feel you here. I have a ton of CPTSD around a needy parent who always minimized my needs in comparison to theirs. I've done a lot of work in this area. I still find it hard to say \"no\" politely... more on that later.\n\nTo help yourself, I suggest asking for time before saying \"yes\" or \"no\" to anything. Start with something small. \"Do you want to grab coffee on Friday?\" \"Could I check my calendar and let you know tomorrow?\" We who jump to everyone's needs never give ourselves the time to decide. Maybe we really do want the coffee, or maybe we are sure we won't have time. But we tend to short circuit and answer instantly.\n\nAnother strategy is to become more conscious of what wanting or not wanting feels like. Go to a store and walk around the produce department. Observe the fruits and vegetables. Which do you want? Which do you not want? Which would you never, ever eat? Sounds simple but it starts rewiring your pathways and, again, teaches your body to take the space it needs.\n\nFinally, remember that people like us are prejudging ourselves in these situations. What you or I see as \"lashing out\" or \"being selfish\" is our judgment of what others are thinking. Are these judgments true? Are they 100% really true? What if the opposite was true? What if you or I express ourselves, and that other person instead responds, \"Oh good, I was worried you weren't happy and now I know!\"\n\nBest of luck on the journey!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nqw59z/how_do_i_remind_people_im_human_without_being_a/h0dgljg/"}
