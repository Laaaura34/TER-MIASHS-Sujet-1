Schedule your time realistically, make time for sleep and rest, and assume people will tolerate you not being available all the time, because they have too. You don\u2019t expect them to be available all the time do you? Like unless there is some info I am missing here, it sounds like the issue isn\u2019t everyone else expecting too much of you but rather you offering more than you have to offer. No one is going to assume you don\u2019t have time for something if you are telling them you do, they are humans not mind readers. Instead of putting the responsibility on others to \u201crealize you are human,\u201d you need to start being your own advocate and stop offering 20 slices of pizza when you only have 10 to give away. It\u2019s not fair on anyone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nqw59z/how_do_i_remind_people_im_human_without_being_a/h0ectvn/"}
