I gradually reduced my social media presence on Instagram and Facebook, over the last two years, until I eventually stopped posting on them all together. Removed all my private information and made my accounts private but left them up. \n\nI love it. I don\u2019t think twice about posting what I\u2019m doing ever or looking at what other people are doing. Honestly all anyone is doing it those sites is judging each other and trying to one up the other. It\u2019s not worth the mental gymnastics!!\n\nIt was easier than I expected and the results have been so positive for my mental health and day to day. \nSounds stupid but it\u2019s true \n\nHats off to you for taking the leap! \n\nStay hydrated and mind your business.
