If you haven't, I recommended checking the \"Couch to 5K\"  program for running training. It is really helpful when running for the first time. I had even made songs for each week by editing slow/fast songs for walking/running schedule. Seeing your progress is really motivating. Good luck with your progress, don't forget to make it fun!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pf43ly/get_myself_in_shape_once_and_for_all/hb20mb7/"}
