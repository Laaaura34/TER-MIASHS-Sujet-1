I didn\u2019t start going every single day, I didn\u2019t push myself beyond belief, all I did was show up. And that\u2019s the most important thing: show up. Even if you absolutely do NOT want to go and can think of a million excuses why, just show up. Even if it\u2019s just for 10 minutes on a treadmill. That\u2019s what I always tell myself on days where it\u2019s hard, I tell myself \u201cok, I\u2019ll go for 10 minutes and if I still feel this way, at least I will have done something.\u201d Normally after those 10 minutes I will have enough energy to at least complete a 30-45 minute workout. \n\n\nIt\u2019s not about pushing your limits every day, it\u2019s not about how much you can do, it\u2019s just about showing up for yourself! Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pf43ly/get_myself_in_shape_once_and_for_all/hb2dlgz/"}
