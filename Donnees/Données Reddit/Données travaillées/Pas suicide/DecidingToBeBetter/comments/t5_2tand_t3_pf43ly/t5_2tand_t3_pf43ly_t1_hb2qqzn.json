In no particular order.\n\n* /r/thexeffect.  \n* Build the *habit*, be wary of just pursuing the goal.   some folks work different ways though, and you'll need to use the semantics that work for you. \n* small goals are smart goals.  Use a series of small achieved goals to *build the foundation* for more complex goals.   i.e. I'm hiking 3 miles minimum every day to work as training for a large thru-hiking trip.   on the surface, taht is 'small goals to build complex goals', but even within that there are goals i have for endurance, speed, weight loss.   \n* I'll cycle back to /r/thexeffect, because that was huge.  I was a hard core x-effecter for about 5 years. and.... goddamn man, that really helped save my hide in many ways.  Doing small things diligently, reliably, over a seemingly unimaginable length of time, really helped clear the way for living in a ... different way.\n\nAnyhow.  that's what i've got for now.   Good luck.   get it!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pf43ly/get_myself_in_shape_once_and_for_all/hb2qqzn/"}
