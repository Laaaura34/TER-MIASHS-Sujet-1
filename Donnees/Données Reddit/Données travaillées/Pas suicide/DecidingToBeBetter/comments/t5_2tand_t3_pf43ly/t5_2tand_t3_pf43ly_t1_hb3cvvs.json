I hope to see an update!! \n\nI recently made the choice to start working out again too, I\u2019ve lost 15lbs in 3 months! and I\u2019ve created some amazing morning habits that have greatly impacted my days. \n\nI wish you all the luck in completing your goals!! It feels like the days are going so slow sometimes and you may not notice all the changes immediately but I promise if you stick with it 3 months will have gone by so fast and you\u2019ll be so happy you didn\u2019t give up on yourself! You\u2019re worth rooting for and working hard for!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pf43ly/get_myself_in_shape_once_and_for_all/hb3cvvs/"}
