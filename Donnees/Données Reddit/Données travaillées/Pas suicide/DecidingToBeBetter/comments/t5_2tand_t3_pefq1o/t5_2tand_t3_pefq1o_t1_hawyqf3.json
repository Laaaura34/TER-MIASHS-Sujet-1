It's actually good that so many things excite you in life and you pick up different hobbies! I would suggest that you have a separate section - a room/ a cupboard/ closet etc for your hobbies and divide space with organizers and label them. You can start by first discovering/ creating such space and then moving onto one project at a time to not overwhelm yourself. For example - you could start with the study table - make it an activity and enjoy it with family maybe? Create beautiful labels, have fun breaks etc. And slowly one place at a time, move excess stuff into the space that you have created. This will not only give you a sense of what all there is but also what all you don't need. Outward space should ideally be minimalistic, so as to make cleaning/ sweeping an easy task and not overwhelming if there are too many small items to be individually cleaned. Also, personally I have realised filling the space around me with plants not only calms me but also limits my impulse to shove more things in the \"gaps\". There are a lot of cleaning and organizing channels on YouTube with great content, I personally like the ones where professionals help organize clutter - it makes me feel peaceful. Be kind to yourself, you've got this :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pefq1o/how_to_be_more_organized_and_tidy/hawyqf3/"}
