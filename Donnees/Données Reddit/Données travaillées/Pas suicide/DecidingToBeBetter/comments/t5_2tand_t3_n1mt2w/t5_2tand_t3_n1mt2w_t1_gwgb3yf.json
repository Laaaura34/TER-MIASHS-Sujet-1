Your metabolism will shift. \n\nGod, diet is and always has been the hardest thing for me to change (I'm sure I'm not alone). I've made several attempts in my life to do better in this department, but nothing seems to stick.

It's hard as hell because as a lifelong gamer, my brain is wired to want action 24/7. I'm starting small, by forcing myself to go sit outside for 10 minutes everyday without any external stimulation. Ironically, I used to read *a lot* in high school, but reclaiming my attention span is an ongoing effort nowadays.\n\nThanks for you insight.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n1mt2w/which_aspects_of_physical_selfcare_should_an/gwgb3yf/"}
