The best way I\u2019ve found to begin is by interrupting your regular activities for self examination time. You\u2019d ask yourself what kind of vibe you\u2019re putting out, if you\u2019ve practiced gratitude at any point that day, and if you\u2019ve put into mental words your hope for something good in the future. Perhaps you have a clearer picture of the kind of person you want to be. If you can capture the key descriptors of that in three words, set an alarm on your phone where those three words show up, and that will be the method of interruption and key to positive habit generation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dygyro/i_am_a_chronic_complainer_and_it_affects_me_at/f81iluk/"}
