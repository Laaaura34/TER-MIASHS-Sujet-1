I do it, too.  The truth is, when someone asks me  how I am, my answer is usually \u201cgood\u201d whether I am or not. I have chronic pain syndrome (including headaches everyday); am I supposed to answer accordingly? For me, answering \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cfine\u201d helps me feel better. If I answered truthfully, it would bring people down and why would I want to do that?     I have a friend at work whose feet both turn inward and at times it\u2019s difficult for him  to walk. He doesn\u2019t complain, and his motto is \u201cbe positive every day\u201d .                                  Sometimes people automatically ask \u201chi, how are you?\u201d and before you can answer or ask how they are, they get right into what they need (I\u2019m referring to my job answering a busy switchboard). Those people don\u2019t really care; it\u2019s just an automatic response. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s good or bad-it is what it is.
