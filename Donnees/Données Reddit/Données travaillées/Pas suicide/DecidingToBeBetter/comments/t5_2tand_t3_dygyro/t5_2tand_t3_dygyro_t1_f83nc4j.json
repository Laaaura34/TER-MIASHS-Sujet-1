Thank you! I know I complain because it\u2019s like a love language at my work - people connect through complaints. And I\u2019ve gotten addicted to it. Though over the past four or five months I\u2019ve detached from those people as friends and feel almost addicted to it, even in general elsewhere because so many are like these people.  \n\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t always this way. I feel like trying to read three interesting facts or jokes a day might be a good segue for me. And if I\u2019m stuck with those people, use that as a way out, as I suspect not everyone wants to connect this way, and they might like the lifeline out.\n\nthank you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dygyro/i_am_a_chronic_complainer_and_it_affects_me_at/f83nc4j/"}
