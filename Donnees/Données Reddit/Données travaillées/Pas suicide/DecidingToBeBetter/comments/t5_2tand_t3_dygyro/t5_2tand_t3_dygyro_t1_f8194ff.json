She said it was hot and steamy weather and everyone was sitting around and complaining, the whole cast was miserable.  Then she came across Dolly Parton, who was also in the cast, she was not only not complaining but was down right happy, perky and singing not even showing any discomfort .  Julia asked her how she could look so fresh when everyone else was miserable  and she said I have waited my whole life to be a movie star why would I waste it complaining, I am happy!   For some reason that story always stuck with me,   it is always a choice, how you feel and and act", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dygyro/i_am_a_chronic_complainer_and_it_affects_me_at/f8194ff/"}
