I grew up in a \"complaining-as-communication\" household and it took a while to break off old habits but holy fuck, I was *so* much happier when I wasn't bringing myself down every time I opened my mouth.\n\nAnd I discovered two great things once I'd really cut down on the complaining. The first was that other people started to want me around more, and were more willing to spend time with me, but the second was that I actually kind of liked myself. When I wasn't being negative all the time, it left space for me to be funny and be kind. The difference was huge and it definitely changed my life for the better. I'm so glad you're on the road to a more positive relationship with the world.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dygyro/i_am_a_chronic_complainer_and_it_affects_me_at/f816vru/"}
