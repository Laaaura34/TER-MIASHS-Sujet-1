Given, the way things are run here are questionable and sometimes we have to do our work twice because of various reasons which can be aggravating. However, Ive also tried to be a lot more mindful in regards to playing into the complaints. Whether it be diverting attention, not even responding, or suggesting a \"look on the bright side\" approach. Its tough to break out of those bad habits and its for sure not an overnight thing, but the first step is realizing these bad habits. Good on you man, keep fighting the good fight!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dygyro/i_am_a_chronic_complainer_and_it_affects_me_at/f82j9xz/"}
