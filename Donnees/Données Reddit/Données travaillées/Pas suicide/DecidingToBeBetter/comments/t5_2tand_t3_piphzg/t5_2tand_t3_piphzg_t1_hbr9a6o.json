Yes. It sounds so childish to say that but it\u2019s true. Lol. And another thing that helps me is to have a good character and be nice to people because you never know, the interaction they have with you could make them feel good when they were feeling low of themselves.  It can brighten up their day. I hope I make sense. I\u2019m bad at explaining.  One other thing that may help would be to put yourself in their shoes. Would you like if someone talked behind your back? :( maybe not.  And one way to not look others with judgement is to know that we humans aren\u2019t perfect. We have a lot of flaws. Goodluck with everything\ud83d\udc9d take care!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/piphzg/how_to_become_more_kind/hbr9a6o/"}
