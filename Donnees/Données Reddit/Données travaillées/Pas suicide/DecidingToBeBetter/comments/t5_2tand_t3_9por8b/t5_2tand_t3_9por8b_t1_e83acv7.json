I was a cashier at a supermarket, trying to make ends meet. Right afterwards, I felt really fucking mad but instead of reacting the way I wanted to, I took a step back and realized I need to do better with the next job.\n\nI was there for 3 months, I made a lot of friends there, I might go back and ask for another position (who knows) but I feel like the answer will be a no.\n\nSince I\u2019m not sure about that, right after I left the store I started my application process again for other places in my area. I\u2019m right back at it and I really want to do it right this time. I feel what you mean man, maybe this is just the kick in the ass we needed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9por8b/i_just_got_fired_and_its_going_to_be_the_best/e83acv7/"}
