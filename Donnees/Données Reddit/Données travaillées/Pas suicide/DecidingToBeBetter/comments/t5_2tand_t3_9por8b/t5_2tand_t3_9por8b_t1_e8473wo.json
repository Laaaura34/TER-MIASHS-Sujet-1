I had thrown up the \"fuck it\" flag after I requested a day off to take my newborn to her doctors appointment. They started giving me grief about it and asked why my wife wasn't taking the appointment. At that point they realized my last fuck was given and let me go shortly thereafter. The following month I made more money freelancing (graphic design and video production) than I was making at the job.\n\nIt ended up working out pretty good in the end, my previous boss was working on something new and had an open position that fit my skill-set and so I came back and am pretty happy being back to where I was before.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9por8b/i_just_got_fired_and_its_going_to_be_the_best/e8473wo/"}
