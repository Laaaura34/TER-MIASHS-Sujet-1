I was told I would get that after my suspension, instead I come to work and my boss calls me in to his office to let me go. \n\nThere\u2019s more to it, like this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been lied to by my boss, or how I was told that the company would work with me if being a cashier didn\u2019t work out. The firing also occurred when they started building newer self checkout machines which could also have something to do with it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9por8b/i_just_got_fired_and_its_going_to_be_the_best/e84bhwj/"}
