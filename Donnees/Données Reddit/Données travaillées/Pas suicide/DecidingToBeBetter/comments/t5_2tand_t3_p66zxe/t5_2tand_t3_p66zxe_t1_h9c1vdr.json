You're brave as shit and you're a survivor.\n\nI know exactly what you're talking about when your brain \"aborts\". I experience it as an anxiety spike and then my brain shifts my attention in self-defence. I've been working on that by doing the standard deep breathing exercises when I'm having trouble, and also verbalizing what I am setting out to do. For some reason, speaking the words out loud helps me with this a lot. Also, r/adhd has a lot of great tips for living with executive functioning.\n\nI also have chronic clinical depression due to Bipolar Disorder, and yep, it blows. I've found that I haven't been able to live alone without deteriorating, so I've made peace with that. Living with someone else encourages a routine, which helps with daily functioning. \n\nI know it doesn't feel like it, but things will get better. Remember that depression impairs our ability to plan and look into the future, so you're not seeing everything for what it is. Everything that you have is treatable, and you have it in you to defeat it, shitty healthcare system or not. \n\nWe're all here cheering for you.
