If you can\u2019t do it for you, do it for us. Shower. Drink water. Call your psychiatrist or counselor. Tell him/her that you need help, that you are stuck. Then make a list of what you need to do to feel better. Start checking things off that list. Try helping other people - you will soon realize many people are worse off than you are. And keep us posted on how things are going - people who are depressed need to be held accountable because their brains lie to them about how awful they are or how little they deserve. No shame, no guilt, today is the day you stop being the person you describe in this post. I love you. You need to love yourself too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9bp000/"}
