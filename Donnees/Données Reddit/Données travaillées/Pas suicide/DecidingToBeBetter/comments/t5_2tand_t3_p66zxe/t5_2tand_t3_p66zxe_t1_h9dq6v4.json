The body is a memory organ, just like the brain is, however, it communicates differently. The brain communicates through language and thoughts, the body through feelings and emotions. \n\nI hear the trauma you experienced in your past. Your body is likely reminded of those traumatic experiences. Something is triggering this anxiety. The body is likely reminded of a period when things went wrong. It is anticipating a bad outcome and it overreacts. It is trying to keep you small and and not in action as it is trying to avoid having you fail or get hurt. You are impacted by an overreactive fight, flight or freeze response.\n\nThe things is that the anxiety is as paralyzing as you being chased by a real bear.  The body cannot distinguish the difference between real fear and imagined fear.  The best thing you can do is unpack it, consciously discover the fears your body is experiencing. If there is a real threat, take action. Likely it is imagined threat. Have compassion for yourself, especially your young self who made these decisions when you were experiencing the trauma.\n\nThank you for being honest and for sharing yourself. That is a very courageous act. Do you see how many people you already helped with this? Keep on your journey until you are fully at the bottom of it. I promise you there is a bottom!  When you discover that you will be free and done!\n\nMuch love to you.
