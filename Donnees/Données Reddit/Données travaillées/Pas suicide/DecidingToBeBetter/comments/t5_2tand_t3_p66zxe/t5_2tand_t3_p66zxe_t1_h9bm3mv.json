It sounds like a lot of your life has sucked so far, but it's a cognitive fallacy to think that just because something has always been one way, it will always be that way.  It's a way of taking control of the uncontrollable- if you believe it will always be this bad, then you can take action.  If you don't know whether it will get better or not- well- the ambiguity is intolerable, so our brains force us into a decision (suicide,etc.) to relieve the pressure.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>You wrote a fantastic, articulate post. You are working.  Your brain and body are working.  You need help, and it is out there.
