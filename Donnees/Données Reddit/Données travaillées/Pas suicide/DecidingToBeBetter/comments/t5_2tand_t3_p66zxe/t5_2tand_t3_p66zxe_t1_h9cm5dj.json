Finally another comment that isn\u2019t just \u201cdude it\u2019s not that hard to have a shower and snap out of it\u201d!! I have severe ADHD that went undiagnosed and untreated until last year at age 21, and similar comorbidities to OP, and was in an eerily similar position to OP in this post until I received the correct treatment, in my case stimulant medication (Elvanse/Vyvanse), which although not an ultimate fix also treats the symptoms of a lot of my other comorbidities besides ADHD. And it was definitely a life changing experience realising I wasn\u2019t broken and there was something that could improve my symptoms, I\u2019m by no means cured but now have found the motivation to do the rest of the work I need to sort my issues out. \n\nThe only difficulty is in the UK, where I also am from, it is extremely difficult to get an adult ADHD diagnosis & treatment through the NHS, the waiting lists are endless and it\u2019s really hard not to lose hope.\n\nOP: I mentioned this in my main comment, but there is an online private psychiatric service that can provide diagnosis and treatment for free if agreed to by your GP, it\u2019s a lot to explain but message me/reply for info if u want! It\u2019s how I received my adult ADHD diagnosis & treatment at 21.\n\n& also check out r/ADHD, some of the posts may really ring true.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9cm5dj/"}
