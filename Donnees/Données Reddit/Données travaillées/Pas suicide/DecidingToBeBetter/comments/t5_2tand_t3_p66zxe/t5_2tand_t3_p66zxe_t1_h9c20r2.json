Maybe use soap, maybe don't. Rub your skin with just the water perhaps. Take however long it takes until you get out. If this turns out to be an all night or all day task, so be it. Being clean or just feeling clean has a dramatic effect on your overall mood. \n\nIf this is too much, then just wash your hands. Try splashing water on your face. Even rinsing off my feet makes me feel better sometimes. I hope this helps a little bit. I sometimes go too long without showering but after I make myself get it done, I feel at least a little better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9c20r2/"}
