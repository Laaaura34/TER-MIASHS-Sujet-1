So here it is:\n\n[MDMA therapy](https://old.reddit.com/r/mdmatherapy/) has helped many people with CPTSD. I've actually met someone who had CPTSD and healed themselves with this modality. I'm doing this type of therapy, and I've done it [with] a guide, which didn't really work out but there was an obvious impact during the sessions that can't be denied of its potential to heal. I'll be doing it again but this time it will be alone and it will be the first time of doing it [without] a guide. I've read from people on the MDMAtherapy sub of healing themselves via doing it solo and I believe I have a much greater chance of healing myself by doing the solo method as well. And since I know MDMA can be acquired in the UK, though maybe not through normal means, this can be the alternative you have been looking for to resolve your mental health issues. I believe this can help us both.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/haiveby/"}
