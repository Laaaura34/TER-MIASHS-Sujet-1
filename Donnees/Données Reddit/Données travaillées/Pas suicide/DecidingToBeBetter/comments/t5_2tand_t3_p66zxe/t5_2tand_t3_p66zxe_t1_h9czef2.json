Just an observation of my own experiences. \n\nI struggle with most of the same things that you do. Personally, I don't have health insurance, so I can't get tested or treated for anything. But I've found a couple methods that help my symptoms. I can learn to intentionally feel symptoms, and use them against each other. I can disassociate myself out of an anxiety attack, for example. \n\nTo escape from disassociating, it helps to just suddenly think \"I'm going to go do x thing\" and then you do, without a moments hesitation. Has to be sudden and spontaneous. And once you start doing something, and planning to do something, don't stop until you've accomplished what you need to get done. \n\nEven if you can't get diagnosed, even if you can't get treatment, there's still ways to work around the cards you've been dealt.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9czef2/"}
