I can relate to a lot of your issues of abuse and even lacking the will to do anything. I am slowly improving with meditation, proper sleep, proper diet, exercise, and also daily work.\n\nThere\u2019s a book called How to Do the Work that\u2019s also been a great help for me. I know you mentioned you\u2019re struggling to read, but when you\u2019re ready check it out. Try keeping one promise to your self a day and build from there. Maybe it\u2019s drinking one glass of water. Keep that up and slowly build.\n\nI hope you figure this out, you\u2019re still young and all you can do is take it one day at a time. Good luck and you\u2019ve got this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9c79lt/"}
