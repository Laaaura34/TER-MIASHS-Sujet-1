I was severely depressed and my GP prescribed antidepressants. However, she did a routine blood panel to check if I could take the meds - the blood panel showed my sugar levels were over 480 and my HBA1C was 12 (normal is <6) . Additionally I was vit. D and B12 deficient too. \n\nHigh Blood Sugar does have an impact on your mental health. So there is a very good chance that part of your mental issues are due to something physical. \n\nPS: Get HBA1C checked since it gives an indication of how high/low your sugar levels were over a period of time instead of just a single day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9c4f1c/"}
