Time is all we have, at any age, at any stage in life. \n\nUse it. Don't fear it.\n\nA lot of people put a crazy amount of faith in \"fake it 'till you make it.\"\n\nIf you have to fake your way through life, are you really living the life you want?\n\nBeing honest with yourself isn't just about what you can or can't do.\n\nIt's about retrospecting what you have tried, and what you haven't.\n\nAccepting that there is a beautiful person you can strive to be, while simultaneously acknowledging there is a shitty person you *can* become.\n\nAnd finally... knowing that you can ALWAYS change who you are, at ANY TIME, for the better or for the worse. But ***you*** are the only one who can define these characteristics. And only ***you*** can bring upon this change.\n\nI would absolutely love to know what it is you are wanting to try.\n\nBut you shouldn't tell me. You shouldn't tell anyone.\n\nYou should just do it.\n\nAnd once you do, then you can show it off.\n\nDon't get stuck waiting for anyone's validation.\n\nDo it because you really want to.\n\nDo it because you feel it in your gut.\n\nBecause it's the only thing that makes sense to you.\n\nOnce you do, I would love to hear about it :]\n\nThank you for your kind words, and for taking the time to read. I wish you the best on becoming your truest self! Much love!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9d9nqk/"}
