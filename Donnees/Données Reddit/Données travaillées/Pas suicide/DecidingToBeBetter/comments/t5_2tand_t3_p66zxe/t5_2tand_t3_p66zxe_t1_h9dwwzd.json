When I had troubles and when others had troubles sport always helped everyone. It makes you physically exhausted and creates a pleasant feeling when you're done exercising. Just bike around the town or jog when you feel like it etc. After a while it will develop into a habit, and when you have a permanent habit a stable point in your life, in this case sport , then it's a lot easier to move forward. I hope the best for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9dwwzd/"}
