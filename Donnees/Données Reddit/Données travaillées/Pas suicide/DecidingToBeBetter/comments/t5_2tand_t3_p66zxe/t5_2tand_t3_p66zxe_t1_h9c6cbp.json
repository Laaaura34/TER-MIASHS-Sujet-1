While it's not the entirety, it is why I feel even more pressure. I'm already behind myself, dumber and more inept than I was 2 years ago. But I'm way behind other people. I've never had any sense of self (intrinsic) value and always experienced that the only way to be liked or cared about was to be successful and achieve. I've never been capable of feeling value for just being me, or being liked for just being me. So when I say I'm a failure, that also entails I'll never be liked, have the life I want, a good and happy life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9c6cbp/"}
