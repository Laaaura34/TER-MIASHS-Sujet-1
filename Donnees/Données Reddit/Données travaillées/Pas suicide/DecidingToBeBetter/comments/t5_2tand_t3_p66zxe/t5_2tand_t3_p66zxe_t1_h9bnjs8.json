I went through significant amount of family trauma ever since this pandemic broke out so I was kinda trapped in a victim mentality, getting panic attacks everytime I see people being happy and working hard for their goals while i was cursed with this fcked life that i have got. I got diagnosed with ADHD and it made me even worse. One of my close friends, put it blunt and real, told me to stop throwing a pity party and accept what has happened in the past and move on. OP if you are reading this, just know, youre not alone. Seek out what unfair advantages that you have in your life and cash them out. You got access to good health care,education and medication, something that people could only dream about in my country. I am not saying this to make you feel guilty about yourself, but you have not got it the worst. As long as you breath, you got time to improve! \n\nHaving said all that, find out the little things that you enjoy in your life and keep them near and dear. Stripping you of all materialistic things, you have meaning, give love to others to love yourself. It could be anything, find a hobby that you genuinely like and throw yourself in it. You will come out of this slump. Remember to start slow. If you think you can do 100 pushups, do 5 every morning till it gets stuck in your routine, good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9bnjs8/"}
