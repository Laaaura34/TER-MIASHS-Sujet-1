I'm glad you have achieved this level of self-awareness. Not a lot of people have it, a lot of people die without it, and a lot of people die because of not having it. I mean it. I've seen it.\n\nI understand being unable to achieve what you set out to accomplish can frustrate the living fuck out of anybody, but try to also be fair to yourself and recognize that you at least put in the effort.\n\nThere will never be a day in your life where you accomplish everything you want.\n\nYou will always feel like you could've pushed \"just a bit farther.\" And that's good. There is no shame or arrogance in always wanting to improve.\n\nBut take the time to look at the trail you've left, and feel proud of how far you've gotten.\n\nMoving your body, however... there's no caveats to that. It's always positive. \n\nIf you're down, it'll pick you right up.\n\nIf you're feeling great, it'll elevate that elation.\n\nAnd like you said, \"Just move, it leads to another movement\".\n\nThat's absolutely true! That's life! One journey right after the other! \n\nKeep aiming higher every day, man. But remember to be proud of where and who you are right now! Cheers! Much love!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/ha8ra2x/"}
