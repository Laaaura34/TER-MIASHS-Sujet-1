I feel I'm starting my life over at 28 I used put myself down for being behind other people my age. \nCompared to doing it after being wrongfully convicted and spending that amount of time in jail and they are excited to begin their new lives, which won't be plain sailing yet they know that and want everything life brings them to or brings to them. \nThinking of it that way makes it feel like I've got a faaar better restating point so I should be making the most of it and always be grateful for the place I'm in even if it seems bleak. There are people out there (yes issues differ) that show how woth hardwork you can reclaim your life. Ibagree this advice should be shared more.\nI no longer compare my self to anyone. I'm not going to be embarrassed about being an \"older\" student, so what if some people my age have jobs, houses, kids, great on them. They didn't live my past decade though  its no excuse but too much time in psych wards etc didn't always help. I still take meds abd have calls with a cpn don't get me wrong mental health is so important but it doesn't have to be a life sentence.
