You try to do the things you know you like but your brain screams no and it just makes you feel worse. You are supposed to do something and you watch as the clock ticks by and you run out of time. It's terrible. I don't know if there's any real way to out of it, but I find the severity to wax and wane.\n\nTwo things that have helped me are: 1. Figure out who are the people you naturally feel a desire to lean on and talk to them about how you want to be able to turn to them on bad days. It takes time to learn the difference in between turning to someone for support and turning to someone to fix your problems (which they can't and shouldn't try to do). 2. Your pain can be used as a way to make you more sensitive to the pain other people are already feeling, and showing them you understand and that they can be their real self with you can help them in ways that makes you feel less terrible about your own struggles.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9cbl84/"}
