I think there are some really valuable ideas here, and I'm going to put those actionable steps into action. I'm very much an \"internal locus of control\" style person, so when I have an issue, I want to take action. But most articles about confidence only restate the states of mind, not giving much more advice than \"think/feel differently,\" which really isn't easy when you have no actions to give you reason to think or feel differently. \n\nYour \"Important Note\" section also hit close to home. I've been struggling with accepting that some friends whom I've stressed over trying to help simply aren't willing to put in any effort. It hurts and feels like a shortcoming of my own that I can't help them, but I can't keep draining myself in hopes that they'll start moving. I can't keep giving and giving when I'm not getting anything back. Even though that \"something back\" would be seeing them better off.\n\nThanks for the thorough write-up. I can tell you really thought about this topic.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/onf5qk/an_indepth_practical_guide_to_confidence_what_to/h5sbppg/"}
