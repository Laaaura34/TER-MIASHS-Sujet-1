For instance, the manager of local McDonalds will have situational confidence while at work because of his position in the environment. However, put the same guy in a Silicon Valley tech meet-up and he\u2019ll have zero status, thus zero confidence. \n\nBaseline confidence is something you get after successfully dealing with a certain situation in the past. If you\u2019ve been training jiu jitsu for 15 years you\u2019ll likely be confident when some dude is trying to appear tough at a bar. This can also be generalised. If you\u2019re used to being but in new situations and you usually come up on top, you\u2019ll carry a confidence that tells you that you\u2019ll probably be able to deal with the unknown in the future as well", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/onf5qk/an_indepth_practical_guide_to_confidence_what_to/h5uzyl3/"}
