Confidence really is a fickle thing that can come and go if not paid attention to. One thing I\u2019d like to add for a simple small win everyday is to simply have a morning routine. A consistent morning routine has helped tremendously in me getting the ball rolling each day. Start the beginning of the day with a series of small wins; such as immediately making your bed, brushing your teeth, showering, yoga, exercise, meditation, etc. A series of small wins beginning your day can really go a long way over time, and can compound into even more confidence to tackle on and achieve bigger wins.
