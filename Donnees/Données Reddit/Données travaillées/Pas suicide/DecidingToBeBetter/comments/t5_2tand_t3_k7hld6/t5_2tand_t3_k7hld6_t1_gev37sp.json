Today is my 6 months free from drugs and alcohol and my entire life has changed. I love hearing of others successes! I\u2019m actually at peace most of the time, but for the days that aren\u2019t perfect I have my support network. It definitely gets better. I only have to keep doing what I\u2019m doing because I\u2019ve found it takes habits to break habits.\nOne of the many new habits I\u2019ve incorporated into my life (besides working a program, yoga, and meditation) is reading posts like this \ud83d\udc40and having gratitude for your inspiration to keep going. I can\u2019t wait see what my one year will look like! See you at 18 months.
