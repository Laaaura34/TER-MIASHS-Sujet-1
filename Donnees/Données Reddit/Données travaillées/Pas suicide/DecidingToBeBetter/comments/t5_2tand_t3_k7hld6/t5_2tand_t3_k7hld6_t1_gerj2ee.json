One year? No small feat. Celebrate yourself and be proud of where you are. Those raw inner feelings are part of life for all of us. You chose to accept them and face them, and that is progress.\n\nI hope you have solid support around you. If you don't, turn to Reddit! You'll find it. I mean, look at this comment thread. \n\nIn fact, every year I donate to a cause during Christmas. Send me a message and I'll donate to a sobriety cause of your choice.\n\nYou're doing great.
