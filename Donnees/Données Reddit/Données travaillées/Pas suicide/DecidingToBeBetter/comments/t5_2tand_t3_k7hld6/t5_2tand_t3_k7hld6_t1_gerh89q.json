I thankfully grew up with a weak stomach so drinking alcohol always meant spending the rest of the night at church praying to the porcelain god for mercy. (I've had to tell people I had an allergy to alcohol to get them to stop shoving drinks in my face because, \"I don't like to drink\" sometimes wasn't good enough.)\n\nI hope you're as proud as you should be for a solid year of sobriety!
