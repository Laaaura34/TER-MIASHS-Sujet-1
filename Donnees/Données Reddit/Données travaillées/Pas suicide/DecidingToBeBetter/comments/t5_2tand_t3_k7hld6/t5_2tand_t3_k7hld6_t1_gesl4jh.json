You're always welcome in the rooms. I've been a friend of Bill for five years, and I gotta say, learning new ways to cope that didn't end with a bender have changed my life for good. I wouldn't have my tenacity in a terrible job market, my devoted relationship, my friends and community, none of it if I hadn't stayed sober all this time.\n\nYou can come join us in r/stopdrinking whenever you feel ready. Online meetings are always open at intherooms dot com too\n\nLots of love! IWNDWYT", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k7hld6/one_year_sober_today/gesl4jh/"}
