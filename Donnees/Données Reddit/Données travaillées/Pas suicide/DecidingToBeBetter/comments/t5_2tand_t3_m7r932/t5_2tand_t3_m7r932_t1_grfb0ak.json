I dropped people who wouldn't respect them, and many left on their own once the favor bank closed. I now have one friend. He is amazing, but I need more connections to function. I have to keep limiting myself because I don't naturally have limits, which is decidedly unhealthy. I miss being able to just follow my impulses. I need to not feel nostalgic for poor decisions. \n\nI try not to call them boundaries myself. Mostly because I can still hear my mother mocking me for asking for them. I call them \"Rules of Engagement\". I have a lot of rules, and I don't break them even if it feels like a survival issue, though I do have an entirely different set of rules for situations like that, if it meets certain pre-defined criteria.\n\nBoundaries are hard. I always feel the need to sacrifice myself for the greater good. If you figure out how to make it work, could you let me know? My method is lonely and exhausting, I am always looking for a better way. Good luck on your journey, from one traveller to another.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7r932/how_to_set_boundaries/grfb0ak/"}
