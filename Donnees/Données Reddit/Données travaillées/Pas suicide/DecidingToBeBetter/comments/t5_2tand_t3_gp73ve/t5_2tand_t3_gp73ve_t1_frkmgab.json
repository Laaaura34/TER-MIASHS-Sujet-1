Good on you for recognizing that and consciously keeping up these kindnesses.\n\nWhen I was married (long ago), I told my (now ex-)husband the one thing I wanted for my birthday was I wanted to be the girl who got called to the receptionist in the lobby to come pick up the flowers that were delivered to me at work that everyone else in the office wished they were getting. His response was that flowers were a waste of money because they would just be dead in a couple of days. Ultimately, he found the cheapest bunch he could possibly have delivered and sent those to me at work. Not because he couldn't afford them, but because he didn't think it was worth it. Which sounded an awful lot to me like he didn't think \\*I\\* was worth it.\n\nI will tell you something. Every year since then, I have gotten flowers on my birthday, the exact flowers I want\u2014some variety of bicolor roses\u2014even if I have to get them myself some years, because I am worthy of being happy on my birthday.\n\nI am so glad that you recognize that you are also worthy of kindness and self-care!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gp73ve/ive_decided_to_be_kind_to_myself_after_a_breakup/frkmgab/"}
