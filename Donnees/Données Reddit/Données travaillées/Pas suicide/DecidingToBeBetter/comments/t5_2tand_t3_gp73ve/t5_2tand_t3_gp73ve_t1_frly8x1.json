Do I just want to say thank you? Do I want to give him closure for something that was left unsaid? Do I want him to comfort me? Do I want him to tell me he wants me back? If the answer is self serving, then I tell myself that hitting him up would reopen wounds on both sides and further complicate things. \nSo maybe it would be worth waiting a little longer if it\u2019s still raw? Keep your hands and mind busy if you can. I hope this helps and I really hope you feel better soon!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gp73ve/ive_decided_to_be_kind_to_myself_after_a_breakup/frly8x1/"}
