And honestly? I\u2019ve been in therapy for a few months working on my negative self talk. I have an inner critic that is SO LOUD and thinks in absolutes. \u201cEverything bad is my fault. I\u2019m dumb. I\u2019m a failure. I don\u2019t deserve anything good. I will never be happy.\u201d There\u2019s another voice that sometimes says \u201cIt\u2019s ok to make mistakes. It\u2019s not (completely) your fault. You\u2019re doing your best. You can handle standing up for yourself. You are smart and nice and deserving of love.\u201d But it\u2019s soft and quiet and usually can\u2019t be heard over the inner critic. In therapy, we\u2019ve been working on giving the compassionate voice a platform to be heard. \n\nSo I\u2019ve been working on stopping my inner critic in it\u2019s tracks. If it\u2019s being needlessly cruel and dramatic, I correct it and let the compassionate voice remind me that I have the option to be nice to myself. I would never say any of those things to a friend, how can I say that to myself? Alternatively, my therapist suggested *doing* something nice every time I catch myself being mean, which I guess is where the idea from this post came from! \n\nIt\u2019s really hard but I\u2019m hoping that one day, the inner critic isn\u2019t the one calling the shots. Anyway, sorry for the wall of text haha I hope this helps :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gp73ve/ive_decided_to_be_kind_to_myself_after_a_breakup/frm0mfg/"}
