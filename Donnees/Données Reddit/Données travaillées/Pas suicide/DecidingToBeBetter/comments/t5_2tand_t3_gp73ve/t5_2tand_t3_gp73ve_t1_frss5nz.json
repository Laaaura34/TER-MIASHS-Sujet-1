If she claims nothing has changed then it sounds like she wasn't honest with herself when the initial discussion took place and she's backtracking now that you're in a established relationship.\n\nWhether it was intended to or not, she built your relationship on a foundation of false pretenses. That's a bad place to be.\n\nIt could also be that she can't or won't identify where the turning point in her views occurred. I recommend finding out the cause of the shift.\n\nFinding the turning point and working through it is easier (less hard anyway) than changing the foundation of a relationship and an individual.\n\nIf you give in when you're not ready to change something fundamental to you and your relationship then you'll be miserable. You would get dragged into a life you don't want and ultimately you, your relationship, and your potential child would suffer because of it.\n\nIt's a lot to think about.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gp73ve/ive_decided_to_be_kind_to_myself_after_a_breakup/frss5nz/"}
