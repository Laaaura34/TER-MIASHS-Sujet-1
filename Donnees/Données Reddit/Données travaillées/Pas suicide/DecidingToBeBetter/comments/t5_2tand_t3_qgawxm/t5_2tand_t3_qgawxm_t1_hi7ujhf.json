Is there a type? \n\nHave you considered maybe you're pushing out of your league? From your description you sound like a 4-5 \n/10. If you're out there batting for 8-9s you probably ain't gonna get any. \n\nBut you seem to be on the right track for improvement. Getting your body is shape is definitely a +2. Your height and skin colour is unchangeable so no point worrying about that. Leave that. \n\nInstead focus on the things you can change? Like being funny. Women like that. Just focus on what you can (but also want to) change about yourself. And keep interacting with women. You'll find someone eventually. \n\nAlso aim for someone sufficiently within OR below your league. Plenty of women out there. \n\nFinally, online dating is a tough & superficial game. It's not meant for everyone. Some people have better chances trying to date offline.
