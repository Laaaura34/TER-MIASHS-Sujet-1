But you don\u2019t need a woman to be complete.\n\ni think you ARE like other guys your age, because i have this thought all the fuckin time lmao and i\u2019m 22. and this seems to be a common theme in this dating world. i\u2019m working it out myself but i\u2019m trying to do a couple of things:\n\n1. Hit the gym, because looks matter. Unfortunately. If you\u2019re 5\u20196 and fat, you can be 5\u20196 and shredded. I find myself often lamenting things i cannot change, but it\u2019s just a better use of your time to focus on things you can change.\n\n2. Seeing a therapist, and getting to the point where i can stop focusing on past trauma and move on to my future goals.\n\n3. Keeping a job and making money. Not for a woman, but for yourself. You have to have a career or a stable income to be able to support yourself, not to mention another person. Also, don\u2019t spend large amounts money on women that don\u2019t make YOU feel special. \n\n4. This is the big one. Let go of your past resentment. This is difficult, especially when it comes to dating and rejection, because it always stings personally. Sometimes i want to be like \u201cdamn all these girls who rejected me are bitches\u201d but then i realize that is just my ego talking, and these girls made the decision they wanted to. Just like when i reject women, It\u2019s not because im evil, it\u2019s because i don\u2019t want to fuck them. Same kinda vibe. Rejection stings a lot tho so i get it.\n\n\nHonestly i feel you dude. I\u2019m tired as shit. Friendships and relationships are hard, but they\u2019re easier when you are taking care of yourself. And you\u2019ll have some bad days but that\u2019s okay because we all take steps backwards and are imperfect.\n\nHope this advice helps. It\u2019s probably a lot of obvious stuff but it\u2019s obvious stuff that takes work to achieve. The past might have sucked but that doesn\u2019t mean the future has to.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi5j3n3/"}
