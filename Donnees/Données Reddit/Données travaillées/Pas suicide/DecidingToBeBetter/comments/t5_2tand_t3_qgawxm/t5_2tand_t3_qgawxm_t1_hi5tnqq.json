Every relationship in my late teens/early 20s was accompanied by an insane amount of angst over balancing starting my life and being committed to another person. I 100% love where my life is now, but there were definitely opportunities I passed on for the sake of a relationship that honestly was not worth the trade. You\u2019re not wrong that dating is exhausting.\n\nThose things you want to do? Do that. I spent the back half of my 20s mostly single and I do not regret focusing on my career and having fun on my own. I took a couple awesome trips solo (you can travel through europe for a pretty reasonable price staying in hostels, using grocery stores over restaurants, and taking public transport tbh), and with friends. \n\nSure, meeting people can be a bit more difficult as you get older, but it\u2019s not too bad so long as you actively make time. Ive befriended a few of my neighbors over time by virtue of just chatting a bit when I\u2019d see them around the neighborhood. A couple friends that ive had for 7+ years now are people I met at work. Its really not so bad!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi5tnqq/"}
