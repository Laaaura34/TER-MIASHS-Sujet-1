The vast majority of women are shorter than you. Most woman just want someone taller than them (facts). Being brown is also absolutely fine. I specifically know a few good looking white girls who are crazy for brown guys. \nBeing overweight isn\u2019t that great for your health or peoples opinions but the cool thing about that is it\u2019s easily changed. And you DO NOT have to be ripped. Just not overweight.\n\nAs others have said, being a generous person and respecting others can go a long way. Im 29 and a shorter male and when I was your age and younger it felt like everything was so superficial because it is\u2026.. as you get older and people get older what really matters is confidence and kindness. \nDating and friends now at 29 is infinitely easier for me than when I was younger. Less worrying about what others thing and more confidence and trust in myself. \n\nLook at it this way, people stay single forever and live great happy lives!! Why is this? They are comfortable with themselves and don\u2019t care about others opinions on the things they can\u2019t control. All love to you. \n\nAlso, side note, if you can afford it, go to therapy.
