I was 21 when I had my first girlfriend,  I'm 26 now and only had 3 relationships,  but it's ok.  First thing is to actively practice self love and realize who you are and how high your worth really is. I want you to wake up every day and talk to yourself like you would a child version of you.  Would you call an 11 year old a loser? No because you are a better person than that, so why say it about yourself.  If possible I would seek therapy and maybe even a psychiatrist.  I know that I've had crippling anxiety, and recently learned ADD, which didn't help my interactions with people and my own emotional development. I'm on meds now which help with both and I can't believe how much better I feel. You have so many years ahead of you and  defining yourself by the relationships around you , relationships that WILL change over time, will do nothing beneficial.  I know I started feeling out of place with my friend group back in highschool but I never really left them until I was 22. After that I started enjoying my time alone while making friends that I could connect better with. As for chasing relationships, I don't either. I want to put myself in a place where I'm truly happy with myself first BUT if someone comes along for my journey I'm happy to share it with them. Just know that you're not alone and there's millions going through the same thing.  Again, please practice active self love, it's a lot harder than I thought it would be but it will make a huge difference \u2764", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi4zicy/"}
