Life is hard as hell as is. If you give your whole identity a label like that, you will walk around constantly feeling defeated.\n\nIf you don\u2019t already have one, make a small goal. Look yourself in the mirror, and say some positive affirmations like: \u201cI am capable.\u201d \u201cI am dedicated\u201d \u201cI refuse failure\u201d\n\nFocus on your own energy. Create yourself in such a way that you almost forget about being in a relationship. When you are thriving and happy on your own, you will attract people. Not only that, you should probably have much higher self esteem. You won\u2019t care if people are attracted to you or not lol", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi6xvw6/"}
