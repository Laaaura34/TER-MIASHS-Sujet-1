Isn't constantly being mindful about your anxiety or intrusive thoughts re-affirming your constant pain?  In my experience I've come to notice that I have to shift my mentality all the time if I want to \"face\" my anxiety and that requires a lot of painful constant effort, it's like trying to avoid a flooding by constantly covering the cracks from where the water is leaking with your bare hands. At some point, your hands will get tired and will no longer be able to cover the leak for an immeasurable amount of time. The same happens with coping mechanism and switching mentalities. When you can't face it and when you can't resist the pain, anxiety wins.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi8vllv/"}
