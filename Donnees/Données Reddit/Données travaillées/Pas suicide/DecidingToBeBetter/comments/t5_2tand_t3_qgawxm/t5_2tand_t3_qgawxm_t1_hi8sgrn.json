This is what I mean about stepping outside maladaptive thinking.\n\nIgnoring anxiety and depression isn't a prerequisite to healing. Healing requires you acknowledge and face those things, same as acknowledging the physical pain of a wound. None of us who are working to get better are effortlessly free of the pain, uncertainty, or shame.\n\nLike I said, I've read through this and I've seen you apply more effort toward pointing out how every solution offered won't work. That's the mentality you have to battle. Black and white thinking isn't going to help, it's a tactic for avoidance.\n\nOne on one therapy might not be beneficial, especially if you're not in a place where you feel ready to face these aspects of yourself. Group therapy might be better. Think outside the box.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi8sgrn/"}
