I think working on yourself, like working out, going to class, reading, & learning are all things you should be focusing your time on. When you grow your own interests and passions, and actively do what you love, you\u2019re going to start loving and appreciating yourself more. Self love and care is above all the most important thing.\n\nComing from personal experience, I didn\u2019t begin to attract the people I wanted until I gained my own confidence. People started to be attracted to the fact that I had passions and love for myself. Confidence radiates and attracts great people!!!\n\nDon\u2019t rush on the relationship front. It takes time, and I truly believe that if you continue to put out good energy into the world, the world is going to give it right back to you.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, keep doing things for you.  Keep working towards becoming your most authentic self. People will notice & your person will come. \n\nGood luck, friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi776le/"}
