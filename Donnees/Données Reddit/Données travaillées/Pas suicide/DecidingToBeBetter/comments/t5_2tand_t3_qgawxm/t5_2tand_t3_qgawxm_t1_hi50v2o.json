It can be small, even \"I am pretty nice to ppl\" or \"yeah I'm still trying\" or \"Hey I got outta bed today when i REALLY didn't want to\" and just find something every day to compliment yourself with. Honestly if I could I'd reach over and give you such a big hug because you remind me so much of myself when I was younger.  I always felt like my friends were just a better version of me and why do I even exist. I know comments from random strangers aren't the best but if you get nothing else from these comments from ppl then please seek a professional if you can. You have so much more to you than you realize, even if you don't believe me, a stranger. And if you still have trouble then please post in r/selflove because I KNOW the community there will be more than welcoming to you", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi50v2o/"}
