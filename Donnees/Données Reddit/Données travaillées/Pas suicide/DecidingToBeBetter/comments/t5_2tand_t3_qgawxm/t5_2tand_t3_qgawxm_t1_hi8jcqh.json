I'd suggest working on this specifically, when you're talking to a therapist. A therapist cannot summon a social life for you, however, working with a therapist on maladaptive emotional attachment and healthier coping mechanisms could be very beneficial.\n\nThe main thing is: you're not broken, nothing needs to be fixed about you. Approaching your mental health like it's something you need changed or \"fixed\" is counterproductive and puts far too much meaning and pressure on small situations because you're terrified you'll mess up and that will reaffirm your negative beliefs cycle.\n\nStep outside those beliefs, even if it's just saying to yourself \"I'm trying to step outside this belief that everyone will leave me.\" Allow yourself the notion that you haven't seen or experienced all that there is, and so it cannot be just hopeless.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi8jcqh/"}
