Only difference between us is I'm a whitey. I'm so incredibly tired of chasing and most the people I end up chasing aren't worth their weight in salt... no wait... they're pretty salty actually. I'm so fed up with society's expectations. I'm just minding my own business and pushing forward until school is done and over with and I can start focusing on what I want to do instead of what I need to do. First and foremost, I hope to get a therapist, but that doesn't seem too likely given the circumstances. Either way, live for yourself and stop expecting anyone else to do their share of the work cause in reality, society is fake as fuck and the only reason 99% of people DON'T commit suicide is because of fear of the unknown and survival instincts. Literally everything is a pissing contest anymore and I fucking hate it. How am I suppose to be light hearted and sympathetic when every single system in motion encourages toxic competition. It's all so mind boggling.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi63gye/"}
