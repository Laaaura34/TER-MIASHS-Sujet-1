Even when you go to a doctor for a broken bone or an ailment, there is a process of healing before we can call it \"fixed\". If you have a broken leg and only call it progress when you can use it without limitation, you will never heal and simply grieve a mangled leg.\n\nYou're not going to a therapist to get fixed, you're going to learn about how you cope with situations and what methods you'd like to adopt to help yourself get through things. There's no cure, every person you wish you were more like has to be mindful each day and  has learned healthy coping mechanisms. \n\nThey learned those healthy coping mechanisms either in childhood or as adults, and you have the same opportunity as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi8oqje/"}
