Finding someone rarely happens in a good way when you're 'looking'. It can happen, but often ends up being shallow or rushed. What you say you want to be doing is almost ideal and there is no need to worry about that time being wasted... most people look back and regret the opposite... doing things to make yourself healthy and happy are things you can't really get back later in life. Time spent at bars and parties can be made up for later. \n\nOn the other hand, if it is depression, you won't be able to fix that just by fixing the external problems in your life. The world is filled with people with every positive attribute you can think of, dozens of friends, money, etc who want to end it all because they are fighting severe depression. If the things you enjoy don't make any difference in your level of 'sad', find a professional to talk to, and do those things you want to do and keep going.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi5ltjz/"}
