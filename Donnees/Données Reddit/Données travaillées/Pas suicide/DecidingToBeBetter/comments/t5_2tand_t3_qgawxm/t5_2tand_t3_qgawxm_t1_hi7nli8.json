This is the advice I would give to myself if I could go back in time 10 years. Eventually you\u2019ll (hopefully) come to learn that even though life has a lot of suffering, it\u2019s still really fucking cool. There\u2019s so much novel stuff to do and try and discover and learn about. And\u2026. it\u2019s all you\u2019ve got, so might as well see it through, give it the ol\u2019 college try!\n\nSure it seems like you need the things other people (put on the appearance that they) have: a loving girlfriend, a fulfilling career, money, whatever the fuck. It doesn\u2019t matter. You could have all or none of those things and I bet you\u2019d still wind up feeling the same way again, eventually. Are those people you compare yourself to content with themselves, with their existence on this earth and their place within it? It\u2019s not a quality you can flaunt like you would a hot date, yet it\u2019s worth so much more than that. \n\nI hope you learn to love yourself and all of life\u2019s possibilities! I wager, while you\u2019re busy self-loving, all those things you covet will gently float right into your lap, too :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi7nli8/"}
