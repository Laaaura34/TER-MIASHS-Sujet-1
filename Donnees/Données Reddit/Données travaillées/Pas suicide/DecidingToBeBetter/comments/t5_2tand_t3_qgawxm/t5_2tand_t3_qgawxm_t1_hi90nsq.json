Facing your issues is going to take effort. You're going to get tired. This is reality and isn't going to change. What do you want from us, actual solutions or affirmation that it's hopeless and you're allowed to stop trying?\n\nRemember, this is YOUR life. You're talking to someone with CPTSD, neglected and abused as a child who then grew up and selected abusive relationships because it's what I recognized. Every day I have to wake up and collect myself because mornings give me massive anxiety and that's only the start of it.\n\n It's just life, I refuse to give up on myself, so some days I fuck up and end up crying in the bathroom. I have a good cry, wipe my nose, write in my journal, and go back to educating myself on how to care for myself as I get through this.\n\nI can no longer point to all the negatives in my life as confirmation of my negative beliefs because I'm learning just how much power and influence I have over the way I CHOOSE to see my life. I had abusive parents, I couldn't control that, but I CHOSE my abusive partners in adulthood and I CHOSE maladaptive ways of living (avoidance, rage, substance abuse, promiscuity, you name it, I tried it).\n\nIt takes effort and it is hard and it is every day. No one is denying that. It's important to understand facing your anxieties and pain is NOT the same as ruminating on them and justifying them, which is what I'm seeing here in your responses.\n\nAt the end of the day this is your journey. I wish you the best on that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi90nsq/"}
