I think it's weird to think the gym is good despite most people not benefitting from it, then turn around and call therapy shitty for the same reason (I feel like both the gym and therapy are generally positive).\n\nIf you look closely you can spot a lot of parallels.\n\n...\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nA good portion of people with a gym membership dont go. \n\nAnother good portion that do go don't stay committed long enough to see any improvement.\n\nMany don't use the equipment properly and follow the right path needed for their situation. \n\nGyms aren't necessary, neither are the equipment, but gyms still provide you with easier access to the tools you would need. \n\nMany people go to gyms thinking it's what will cut the weight, or that they'll thicken up pretty quickly. \n\nThrow \"therapy\" in there and you'll start to see the similarities. Like the gym therapy isn't magic, but it can be. \n\n\n\n...\n\nTo respond to your point:\n\nThere are facilities that charge based on income (sliding fees). I get it free through medicaid. My roommate gets it free through her job. You can get other free options from students getting practice (go to local colleges) and some other gentle souls.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi7h47g/"}
