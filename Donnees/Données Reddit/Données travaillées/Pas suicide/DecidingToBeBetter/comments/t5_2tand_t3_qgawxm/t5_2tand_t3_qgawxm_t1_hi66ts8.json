It isn't what it is cracked up to be in our age range. People don't know what they want, they aren't ready to commit, and if they are we're all so emotionally immature that it usually falls apart due to fixable communication issues. \n\nAll of that to say - a relationship wont make you any happier. It won't. Losing weight, reading books, etc to get a girl won't make you happy, it won't make you feel any sense of achievement, and the insecurities you have right now will no doubt rear up during the relationship.\n\nHere is the advice I can give you - wake up every day for you. Learn to love spending time with yourself. I love my alone time. I love hanging out with just my own thoughts, my interests. I am the most interesting person I know, you should try to see yourself the same way. You're a unique individual and you are enough for yourself and anyone else who comes along. When you're working out those 6 days a week, try to reframe your thoughts to \"I am glad I am building my strength and my health.\" Reading books, finding hobbies, working, etc, it all has to be done for you first because at the end of the day you will be the one consistent pillar providing for yourself in your adult life. Relationships will come and go, I promise they will. And you can ensure they have a higher chance of succeeding by taking care of yourself and your needs first.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi66ts8/"}
