You would probably do great with therapy. Let the only dating you do in the near future be for a good therapist. Maybe get on some antidepressants.\n\nThere are many ways to still find love and find friends, but if you are crippled by social exhaustion and self-doubt you will end up bitter and defeated. Please don't worry so much and just look at the things that can be changed right now. Mental health, physical health, and career can be built on. There is no blueprint for life or window of time that you need to make close friends or date.\n\nP.S. I married a beautiful, geeky, socially awkward brown guy and he is the love of my friggin' life. I was his first girlfriend and he was 24. Being brown is not a negative don't let those fuckers ever tell you otherwise, brown people are some of the most brilliant and best-looking in the world.
