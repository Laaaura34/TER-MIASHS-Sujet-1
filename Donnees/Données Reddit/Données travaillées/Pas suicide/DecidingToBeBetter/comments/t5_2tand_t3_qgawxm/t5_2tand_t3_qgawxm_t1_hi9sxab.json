Or are you all shedding people who have nothing in common with you and the lives you're building.\nOften we subconsciously make better decisions than we would consciously when we are young. In hind sight we realize many things we hated at the time were just growth.\nThe brain is very elastic and will strengthen those pathways you use the most. If you are always having depressed or stressed thoughts for legitimate reasons, before long the brain will revisit these thoughts and modes when the stimulus is long gone.\n\nThe brain is always adapting to an environment that should be simpler than it is.
