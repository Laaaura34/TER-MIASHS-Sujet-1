I\u2019m 22M also. I\u2019ve been through the same deal as you. The best I can tell you, is to focus on becoming the best you that you possibly can before even worrying about anyone else. Workout, read and learn. LEARN. I only just realized the value of learning bro. Not academically, but in life. I\u2019m happier than I ever been and shit I still don\u2019t have any damn friends lmaoo just a lovely girlfriend and a fucking cat. I\u2019ve lost 20lbs. Working myself to an extra 30. I read everyday (it\u2019ll take your mind off shit, especially if it\u2019s a new skill you\u2019re trying to learn) and I limit myself from external shit. Again, just become the best you that you can. I have much more words for you but I\u2019m tired of typing lol. If you need anything else just hit me. I\u2019ll be happy to talk to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi8jp6s/"}
