Everything will be alright <3 22 is NOT old. Don't judge yourself so hard. Focus on building a healthy self-esteem and to be happy about your life decisions. Try to be the man you want to be for yourself, before trying to be the man you think you should be for a woman and everyone else.\n\nI know it's hard when you feel the pressure of society on you in your 20's. You feel like now is the time to build your adult life if you dont want to end up being a looser. Don't let society decide what is good for you and put you down. You are good enough! Keep up the good work and try to enjoy your 20's - when you get to be 33 like me you will miss those times!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi84v01/"}
