I promise myself I'll get a 30 minute walk in at lunch, after which I get in 30 minutes of a HIIT session. I use to plan out these really complex routines (on top of my boxing and spin classes) but now I find it so much easier to just go to YouTube and find someone whose workout channel works for me.
