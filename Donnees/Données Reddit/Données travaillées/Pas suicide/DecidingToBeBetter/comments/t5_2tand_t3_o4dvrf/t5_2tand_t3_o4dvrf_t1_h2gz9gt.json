Not every girl is willing to give up their body to plastic, but that\u2019s a whole different topic. \n\nSo basically you\u2019re saying that when you get bored your brain just automatically goes to porn as a time passer? Of course having other hobbies and things to do would minimise the time spent on porn websites, like stated above. So I see it\u2019s a bad decision made that turned into a habit that eventually became a life distraction in which you had to re-evaluate time and decisions but eventually got out of. \n\nDoes your opinions change of people who are addicted to it after you have got over that habit?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4dvrf/deleted_my_200gb_porn_folder_leftunfollowed/h2gz9gt/"}
