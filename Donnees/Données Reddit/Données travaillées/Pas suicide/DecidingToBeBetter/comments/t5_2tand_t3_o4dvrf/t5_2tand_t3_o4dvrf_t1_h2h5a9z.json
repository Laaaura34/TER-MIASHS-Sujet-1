So a big section of what you're seeing is a human being being abused. \n\nWhile some of the acts might meet the legal definition of consent, they do no meet the human definition of consent. Most people don't like to get strangled, slapped, disrespected and degraded on the regular. A lot of the women have current or previous history of trauma and abuse which makes their \"consent\" a moot point.\n\nWhen you start seeing everyday women as sexualized objects, the process of dehumanizing them has begun. Dehumanizing women is what allows violent disgusting acts to be committed. No one goes from respecting women to physical/sexual abuse in 1 day. It's so subtle that even the person doing it doesn't realize that it is capital letters abuse because porn has normalized abuse and sold it to us.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4dvrf/deleted_my_200gb_porn_folder_leftunfollowed/h2h5a9z/"}
