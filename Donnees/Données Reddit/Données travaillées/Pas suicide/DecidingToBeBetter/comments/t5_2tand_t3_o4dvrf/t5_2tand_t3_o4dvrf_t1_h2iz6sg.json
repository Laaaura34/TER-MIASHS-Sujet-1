I never new those stigma existed; especially for fellow members of the LGBT. I would of thought they would be the first ones to say that your sexual preferences don't dictate what kind of person you are.\n\nI did know about the threesome one, my partner talked about finding a BI girl as she wanted to experiment, we only ever been with each other so I think it plays on her mind a bit. I never really thought about it but yeah its seems  petty insenstive now but i guess rightly or wrongly; a BI person can make  a lot of fantasys so some people true. Apologises for playing my role in that one though\n\nSeems like you still manged to have a good outlook despite all that nonsense, I'll keep my fingers crossed for you :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4dvrf/deleted_my_200gb_porn_folder_leftunfollowed/h2iz6sg/"}
