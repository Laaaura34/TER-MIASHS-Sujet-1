I'll get bored, go to reddit, see porn; get bored then flick to instagram and see my social group, which corrupted that platform. its quite a dangerous dynamic which I dont think I truely respected the effects till now.\n\nThats the big one for me, I'm normally quite a social guys, I have  somewhat large social group of mixed genders but since COVID apart from my partner I've had very limited \"interaction\" with women apart from porn, I think my view of women has been effected by it and hope I can sort it out when I get to socialise again.\n\nIn terms of file size, too be honest wasn't too bad; mostly was games that can get into the 50gb+ file size. Only had a few other media types saved. It was more of the princable of getting it out of my routine.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4dvrf/deleted_my_200gb_porn_folder_leftunfollowed/h2gwtfn/"}
