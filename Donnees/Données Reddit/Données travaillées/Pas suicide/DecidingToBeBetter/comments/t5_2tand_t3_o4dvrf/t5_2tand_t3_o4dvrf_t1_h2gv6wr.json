I learnt that is the signal which starts the bad habit, usually beeing bored. I'm trying something that seems to work, its about reverting toxic things  things into good ones \n\nI use my chaturbate account that I used to fap with to stream myself doing pomodoros, reading, coding, writing, whatever productive thing you need to do in the PC and you used to struggle due urges.\n\nThing is that having a little audience, even if the majority are probably bots, puts some kind of pressure on me. I dont even think in anything that isnt my task. Can you imagine that? In a website full of ads and pictures of nude women. \n\nIt's crazy, yesterday I hit x3 50min pomodoros of work + 30 min of reading, easily.\n\nToday tried to work without any spectators and stayed focused for 10min, rest of the day improductive. Gotta work in making easier the good habit so I stay consistent", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4dvrf/deleted_my_200gb_porn_folder_leftunfollowed/h2gv6wr/"}
