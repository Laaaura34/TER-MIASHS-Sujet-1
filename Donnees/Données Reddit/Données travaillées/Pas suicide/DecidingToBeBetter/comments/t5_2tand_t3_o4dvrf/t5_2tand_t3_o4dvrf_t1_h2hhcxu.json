It's not enough to quit a habit, you need something else to fill that time. And you need something else to fill the need that porn filled. And, surprisingly, it may not be sex per se, but that you are using it to fill some other empty part of your life.\n\nYou may want to consider joining sex addicts anonymous and / or getting a therapist.\n\nTen years ago, I had a very active social life, mostly involving social dancing and doing creative projects with people. I still watched porn from time to time, but not as much.\n\nThen I moved overseas to teach English and was placed in a small, very rural town. I had no friends nearby. My closest friend was an hour away by car. My porn habits came back hard because I had no social venues. I also started using cam sites and spent more money than I care to admit to on the sites.\n\nI returned to the US just as COVID started - so that, along with other stressors - created a lot of problems for me. I was in a new area taking care of my parents. I had no friends, no job. My porn habits and my eating habits got all f'd up.\n\nI'm still struggling with it all. And I hope that I can find some social circles - but the social scenes in this area leave a lot to be desired.\n\nBut good on you for the progress you made!
