Plenty of bi folk love that we can enrich committed partnerships with ethical polyamory.  It\u2019s the creeps who get all googly-eyed and fetishise us that are a bit of a problem.  I\u2019ve also had straight female friends who \u201cused\u201d it to get attention; \u201chey, can you kiss me in front of him because I want him to notice me?\u201d - yes, that\u2019s really happened.\n\nTruthfully though LGBT+ folk are just humans after all and so plenty come with misconceptions about others within the group.
