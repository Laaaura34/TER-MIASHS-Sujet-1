You're deserving of acceptance. You're deserving of appreciation. You have worth, and a lot of it. I understand that all you've ever been told is the opposite of what I just said, so it's going to be hard to accept that you are lovable. This story hit hard, because I feel the same way you do. I've always been the black sheep of my family- I'm not religious, I'm also seen as \"rebellious\", I'm gay etc. Point being, you deserve love, always. You deserve healing from these traumas.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbdjgl/the_first_time_a_family_member_asked_me_how_i/gfgjva5/"}
