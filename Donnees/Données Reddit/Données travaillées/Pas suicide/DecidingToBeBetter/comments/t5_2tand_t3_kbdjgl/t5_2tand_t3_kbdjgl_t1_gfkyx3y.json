I\u2019ve become my grandma\u2019s therapist, she always wants my advice, opinion ... and it has gotten better but there are still some open wounds somewhere inside me. It\u2019s not that I wanna dwell in pain, but there\u2019s sadness that didn\u2019t have any space to be let out when I was a child. So I guess it came back cause I need to re-live it in order to move on.\n\nBut thank you. I hope I reach a point when I\u2019ll feel sorry for her someday. thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbdjgl/the_first_time_a_family_member_asked_me_how_i/gfkyx3y/"}
