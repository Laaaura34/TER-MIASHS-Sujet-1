Damnit, I couldn't even read through all your wack ass comments before my eyes got drippy and i tried to stop it, didnt work, now my damn face is wet.  U suck!  *Be aware, in my universe it's opposite day*\n\nBut for real, i can't thank you guys enough for all that positivity you sent my way, i guess i just wasn't expecting and it really means a whole hell of a lot to me...dammit there my eyes go again, gotta end this post lol.
