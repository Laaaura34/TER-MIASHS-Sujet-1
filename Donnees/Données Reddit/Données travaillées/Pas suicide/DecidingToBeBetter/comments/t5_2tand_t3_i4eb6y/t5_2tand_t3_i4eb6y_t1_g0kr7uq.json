I've found that \"stopping\" myself when i'm reacting and trying to reflect on WHY i react like this in these kinds of situations. It's really hard and feels kinda painful, because it usually ends up with me realizing i'm scared of something. (repetition of the past or that someone will think something of me). But it does help me atleast. it just takes a lot of effort on my part. I also need to work on my selfesteem, wich i found is so much harder now that i'm 29 than when i was 20.. (i used to have great self-esteem and feel invincible, but the last year or so has really fucked me up)  \nhope that you'll get trough this and that some of my realisations may help you along the way .", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i4eb6y/how_can_i_learn_to_be_a_healthier_partner_in/g0kr7uq/"}
