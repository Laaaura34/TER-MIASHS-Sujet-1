Luckily, 100kg is also still at a level where you won't have excess skin flopping around later, so that's great!\n\nLosing weight doesn't have to be so hard I believe. It's about changing your diet in a way where your food has more volume with less calories. I highly recommend looking into Greg Doucette's cookbook and since you're young and poor, I'd highly recommend checking out the infamous \"library genesis\" (google it.) so you may stumble upon said book for 0\u20ac.\n\nWith that, I'm pretty sure you can reduce the pain of hunger, still eat quite a lot and reduce your weight gradually anyways. I'd also replace ANY kind of soda with the diet alternatives if that's something you're struggling with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStarting a sport would obviously be another great thing, but honestly, it's totally NOT needed to reduce your weight! That being said, you should weigh your options, find out which sport you enjoy doing, maybe try some things out and find something you can stick with. The key to building that great habit (which everyone should have!) is to start small and increment from there. For example a small calisthenics routine for 15 minutes 3x a week. Or swimming. Or playing ball. You name it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope I was of some help and I'm pretty sure you've got this if you really want it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lorkz1/i_am_just_starting_to_be_obese_at_16/go7wco3/"}
