I made a rule to talk to 3 new people everyday. Just one word was fine and anybody world do; people I passed on the sidewalk, cashiers- literally anybody.\n\nI remember coming home and crying and having panic attacks on my apartment after smiling and saying hello to someone I didn't know on the sidewalk.\n\nNow, I teach ESL and basically all I do is have conversations with strangers. Some of my students I've told that story to can't believe it. \n\nIf I could do it- you can too!\n\nI'm proud of you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ehe472/i_did_small_talk_with_the_cashier_today/fcj9xpf/"}
