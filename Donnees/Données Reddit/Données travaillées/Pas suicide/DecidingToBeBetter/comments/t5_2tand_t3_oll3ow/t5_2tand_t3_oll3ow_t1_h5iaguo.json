You have to accept that you did those things, and that it is okay. Because you wouldn't be who you are today if you didn't make mistakes and learn from them. Accepting yourself for who you are now and being okay with your past is probably the first step I had to take to healing myself. If you think about those things, or even if they come up, just tell yourself, yeah it was stupid but at least I learned to be a better person. My dad knew I was suffering one time, I didn't even tell him what it was about but he seemed to realize recognize my pain. He told me you can't hold that stuff inside because it will only drive you crazy. You have to let it go to move on and as long as you could take something from it and learn a lesson then it is okay to start letting it go. I think of that every time I look back at a cringe worthy moment, and slowly but surely they don't bother me anymore. Some of the worst things I rarely think about, and even as they are coming to me now as I am writing this, they don't have a hold on my emotions anymore. Let it go. They are meant to make you feel that inside to teach you, that's why we have that mechanism. If you didn't feel that you wouldn't have a soul. So let them do their job and move on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oll3ow/i_regret_my_past_and_it_kills_me/h5iaguo/"}
