Though I think I understand the pain you're feeling. It is not like you're now changed so all those pictures of your past will disappear- at least not with the technology we have... If I'm in your position, I would worry, too.\n\nIt'll be a paradox to manage.  I don't know your situation, but I really hope that you will find a way where you can humbly manage to deal with the negative consequences of this, while being able to rebuild your dignity around/on this as time goes.\n\nI hope you have a supportive environment around you... By the way if you change cities or countries, the higher possibility that these pictures won't matter anymore and you can have a fresh start.\n\nGood luck girl.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oll3ow/i_regret_my_past_and_it_kills_me/h5he255/"}
