Bad people are always judgemental and opinionated. They always see the bug in others to lift them up. You can be the best but others will always find something negative to tell about you.\n\nAnother great story goes back to the prostitute who's been forgiven by Jesus. There was plenty of men who pretended to be more than an adulter women but Jesus proved they worth not more than her. If you changed you should learn to be a bit igornat too. Ignorant of what you did! You don't need to focus on things from the past if you managed to cut off. Even God doesn't require from you to live in anxiety for wrongdoings which you now regret so why are you doing that to yoruself ?\n\nLast not least, have a healthy life.
