Every negative thing that has happened in your life has been a lesson and has shaped you into the person you are. It takes time to change your perspective, enjoy the process. Read books about other people\u2019s struggles. We either learn from our own or through other peoples. Love yourself everyday and don\u2019t forget to forgive yourself. I love reading self help books, they\u2019ve changed my perspective greatly. You don\u2019t need to be in a bad place to read self help books.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oll3ow/i_regret_my_past_and_it_kills_me/h5gqv2l/"}
