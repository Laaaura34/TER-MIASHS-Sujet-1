I think a lot of people have these regrets and sins hanging over them. \n\nIt's really important to feel some shame and regret, and recognize that you wish you'd acted differently, but then you do have to forgive yourself. That's why we're always told \"no one is perfect.\" \n\nIf it's not harmful to the person your wronged, try to apologize to them. If they're super cool and mature they'll be glad for reconciliation. If they aren't so calm and blow up at you, just back off and leave them alone. If it would hurt them for you to approach them and remind them of it in the first place, or if they're dangerous toxic people, move on without contacting them. \n\nYou know how you hear about people getting verbally abused? That's kind of what you're doing to yourself if you keep these things hanging over your head and telling yourself that you suck, you're awful. Imagine talking to yourself like a little kid that you care about--a little bro or sister. \n\nIf your little brother or sister screwed up massively, would you tell them they're a piece of crap and don't deserve to move on? No. You speak gently to them and explain how what they did was wrong. You help them fix their mistake, if you can. And then you help them let it go and leave it in the past. \n\nWe all make mistakes, sometimes big ones. Don't try to say you didn't, but it's ok. It will be ok. You can move on and be a good person. You have your whole life ahead of you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oll3ow/i_regret_my_past_and_it_kills_me/h5gbmt2/"}
