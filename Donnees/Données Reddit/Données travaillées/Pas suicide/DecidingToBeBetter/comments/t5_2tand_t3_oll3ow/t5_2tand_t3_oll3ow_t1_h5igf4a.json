Every one of them have been great. A full course would be awesome if I had the time.\n\nSo far it's a lot of little things I do when I am feeling anxious or my trauma is triggered that help me stay in the mental space I want to be.\n\nI would start with just one technique that fits an issue you have. Just use that for a few weeks before deciding how much you need.\n\nThere's a difference between theory and practice, and I wonder if a whole class might be better if you were trying to help others than if you wanted to benefit from it yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oll3ow/i_regret_my_past_and_it_kills_me/h5igf4a/"}
