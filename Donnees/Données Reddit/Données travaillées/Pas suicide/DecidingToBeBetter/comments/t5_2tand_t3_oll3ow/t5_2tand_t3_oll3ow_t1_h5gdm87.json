But this can't erase the past, you don't have that magic, no one does. \n\nYou can  hide from it, and you can try to pretend it didn't happen - but that is just lying. Lying to others, and lying to yourself. You may be a better person now. But a better person doesn't lie, especially not to themselves.\n\nConfronting the past is hard. Accepting your mistakes is hard. Forgiving yourself is hard. But it's necessary. Once you do that, these things you fear won't scare you so much anymore, they won't hold power over you like they do now. You do have some magic in you, you may not be able to erase the past, but you can reconcile with it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oll3ow/i_regret_my_past_and_it_kills_me/h5gdm87/"}
