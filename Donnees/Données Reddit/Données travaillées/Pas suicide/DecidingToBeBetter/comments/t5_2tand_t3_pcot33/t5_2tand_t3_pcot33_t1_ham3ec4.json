Plus I wouldn't want to have a baby if I couldn't completely give my child all of my attention for healthy development. However, I'm afraid if I wait that I won't be desirable anymore. My ex was into red pill community and used to make me watch countless videos of them warning men not to date women over 30 so I still have that fear in me. I know it's illogical because plenty of men date women in their 30s but it's still there that once I reach 30 I won't be desired anymore or that I've 'failed' as a woman to not have had a family by then.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcot33/5_years_ago_i_regretted_not_following_my_dream/ham3ec4/"}
