Amazing progress!  I actually have a piece of helpful advice: Let your school and professors know immediately that youre interested in staying for a PhD.\n\nThe reason is that they may start you on the PhD path early, which could provide funding, saving you tens of thousands of dollars, and time.  Generally speaking, PhDs are not only free, but they will pay you a monthly stipend and there are no prerequisites.    For me, after 10 years out of school, i got accepted to a PhD, skipping my masters, and changing fields from business to engineering (at a very prestigious university) despite never taking any engineering classes or even fundamental courses like physics. The key is that you have to convince them that you are both motivated and fully capable.\n\nRegardless, good luck on your masters program ans pursuing the dream! We're happy for you!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcot33/5_years_ago_i_regretted_not_following_my_dream/hao7ha9/"}
