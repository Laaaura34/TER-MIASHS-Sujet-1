I got rid of alcohol and smoke but got my own shameful addictions: porn, games and social media. They are my place to hide.\n\nOk, you talking about heroin, I always considered it a hard hard drug so in my mind using it puts you in a way worst state than I am in.\n\nBut same time all you do now is way better than I managed.
