Life has been dull for a while now. A toxic relationship hasn\u2019t helped my mental health either. I begin slipping back into depression. I recently got back on meds and am reaching out to ppl in my support group more frequently. I\u2019ve been taking long walks in the woods to clear my head. Early on in recovery life was so wonderful. I\u2019m just trying to hang on and find my peace again. Much love", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9ooz7/i_am_a_recovering_heroin_addict_and_i_have/g1hupe1/"}
