I know for me, I was so fucking thrilled to just finally see the light at the end of the tunnel, to finally not be so alone, and to finally know that I don't have to keep living that way. So naturally, I was pretty high on that alone. But then life starts to happen, we realize we are just people like anyone else and some of us just need to put in a little more work to feel at peace. And that's ok. I am thankful to be an addict/alcoholic and making a list of all the things I am grateful for is always a great way to bring some positivity into my life.\n\nYou're doing great friend.
