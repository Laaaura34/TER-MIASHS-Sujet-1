I've found it so true that when I'm in a kind, warm, compassionate place, the world seems more full of the same - the brain's confirmation bias is an incredible thing and can be used for good!\n\nYour post got me reflecting and I notice that every time I make myself go to that kind place, even when I'm feeling down, it feels like an opening up - like I'm taking a bit of armour off - like I'm saying 'Hi world - I'm a little hurt/vulnerable/stressed/whatever right now, but I still have room for all of you here, too.' And that's the kind of human I want to be :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gc4min/the_power_of_being_kind/fp9avqm/"}
