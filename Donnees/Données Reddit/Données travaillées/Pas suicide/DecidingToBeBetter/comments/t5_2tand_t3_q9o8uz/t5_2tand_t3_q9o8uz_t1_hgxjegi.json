You're going to be sad, happy, disappointed, excited, heart broken, nervous, confident, insecure, and feel all the other emotions at one point or another during your life. \n\nYou only achieve \"happiness\" when you go through life not chasing a single emotion, but accepting whatever the current emotion is and sit with it non-judgementally. Like meeting an old friend in a quiet cafe. You can just sit there without feeling the need to change anything.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9o8uz/how_do_you_even_learn_to_love_yourself_or_like/hgxjegi/"}
