Then replace the image of them with one of yourself. \n\nThen you switch perspectives to your clone and be the recipient of those loving words and warmth. I'll see if I can find a link to my notes where I wrote it in detail.\n\nBecause I think those positive affirmations such as \"I love myself\" are missing an entire half of the equation. You need to feel those words as both the sender and recipient for it to truly have an effect. \n\nAnother exercise was simply to jot down any insecure thought I had, and tell myself the opposite, and really focus on believing it too. You have to feel it for it to work. I had dozens of insecurities accumulated and each session I would just go down the list, making sure to feel each affirmation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9o8uz/how_do_you_even_learn_to_love_yourself_or_like/hhxp2ki/"}
