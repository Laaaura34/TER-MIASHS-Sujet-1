To be okay with who I am and with who I was that got me to this point. It was all a learning experience. It has to be okay from this point, if not you will never grow. So just the fact you want to grow you should know that you are okay and you can let that go. From being okay we will start to build on a solid foundation. We will stop talking negative to our self all the time because relax, it's okay. Learn from your past but don't dwell on it. If we can take something from it, we don't have to be ashamed when we think about it. Get up in the mornings and tell yourself that it is okay to be you today. Then work on who you want to become. Slowly, you will learn to truly be okay and eventually love yourself. Good luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9o8uz/how_do_you_even_learn_to_love_yourself_or_like/hgyuxol/"}
