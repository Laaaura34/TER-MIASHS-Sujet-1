I was pretty closed off through about age 30 and had resolved no one was every going to get to me. Doing personal development work and having people that were going to be there no matter what really helped. I resolved to practice and it took a while (and it still shows up) and there was a moment where that \"armor\" fell. It was terrifying and liberating at the same time. \n\nIn short, keep practicing and be graceful with yourself. It sounds like you have some great friends who are supporting you, use them. And finally, don't let it dominate your thoughts. Your thoughts aren't there to help you be vulnerable, they are there to keep you safe. So let them go and keep practicing sharing with others. I promise, you're learning exactly the way most of us do. You're doing great.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q6n4xq/being_more_open_and_vulnerable/hgie0ok/"}
