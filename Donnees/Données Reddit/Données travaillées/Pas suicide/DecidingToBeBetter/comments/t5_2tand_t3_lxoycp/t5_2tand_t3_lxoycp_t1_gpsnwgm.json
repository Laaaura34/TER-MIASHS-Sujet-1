It can be very helpful to have direct and honest truth. One podcast style show I enjoyed last year was Midnight Gospel, I was having trouble appreciating my day to day life, and it was a huge help.

Thank you again for the recommendation!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lxoycp/unfck_your_brain_podcast_is_actually_helping_my/gpsnwgm/"}
