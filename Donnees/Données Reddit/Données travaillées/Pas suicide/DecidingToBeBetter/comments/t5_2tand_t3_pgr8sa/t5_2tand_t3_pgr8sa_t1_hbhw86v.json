I never went to therapy even though I should, because I didn\u2019t want to tell anyone what I was going through. The people I did at the time didn\u2019t understand, and I realized it just made me feel worse. Just made me think I didn\u2019t have anyone. I was suicidal for a moment, but never could bring myself to do it. Thinking back on that time is painful and has next to no color in those memories. Everyday felt like a cycle.\n\nWhat helped me was being more aware of my surroundings. I enjoy journaling/ writing stories quite a bit, and I would constantly write how I feel. Either my thoughts and feelings, or incorporate how I feel through my characters. Granted, many of my characters are quite depressing, but they had their good moments, as I do too. \n\nWriting helped me think about the situation as a whole, and question how I thought I felt. Why am I sad? Is it because I have no friends? \n\nI never really came up with solutions, but I would think about how I ended up here. I have no friends because I\u2019m busy doing my hobbies or spending time with my family- and I focus on this because this is what I treasure most, instead of attempting to make friends and failing at it. Doesn\u2019t mean I sometimes long for it though. \n\nAnd when I can\u2019t think of anything, I\u2019d just sit there with some good music and be sad. I\u2019d watch the trees blow in the wind, feel the cool air and how the wind rustle against everything. Watch how the sunlight in the fall look thick and heavy as it tumbles through the trees, and how summer is almost buttery. \n\nI started gardening- and I was absolutely fascinated over the whole life cycle of it. A little tomato seed can produce 100\u2019s of tomatoes for you, produce more seeds, and yet also provide nutrition for the ground. Once I had snapped a tomato plant in half with just the stem and planted it anyway. I thought it would die but it grew another plant! But sometimes plants don\u2019t make it and it\u2019s disheartening, but I can always grow another.\n\nAnd as stupid as it sounds, even the immune system in our bodies is quite fascinating. It fights so hard to protect us from pathogens or bad bacteria! If the liver decides you ate too much sugar and too much of it is running around your blood, it turns it into something called glycogen to store it. (Not a scientist, just studied on it) I may not be the skinniest or prettiest person ever, but my body works so damn hard to be alive and I\u2019m thankful for it. \n\nI also would try not to watch the news and watch something happy instead or read good news. I\u2019d eat something good, and pick some flowers. Play Christmas music in the summer, or blast Chicken Noodle Soup (a song from Jhope) while leaving all my windows open so my hair is flapping around in the wind. Watch a spider build its web at night, and watch it take it apart when the sun rises. \n\nIn the end, to answer your question, I started small. I talked to myself in why things occur and why I feel this way. I started noticing the small, but beautiful things in life and built up on it. Now I\u2019m very thankful I\u2019m here to experience and see what life is going to bring at me, whether I\u2019m ready or not. Again life is cruel, but it also has some beauty to it; it\u2019s bittersweet. There\u2019s no such thing as happy endings.\n\nI\u2019ve been told advice before to overcome depression and anxiety, but it really is difficult to listen to. There are days I feel like I\u2019ve fallen back into the rabbit hole, but I try my best to remember all the good times I\u2019ve had in life and how far I\u2019ve come. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how much of this actually makes sense or helps, but I hope you find something you need to hear in this. There\u2019s going to be ups and downs in life, as everyone says. It\u2019s ok to be sad. But think it through, and focus on the little things in life that makes you happy.\n\nEdit: gotta also start thinking optimistic. Makes a huge difference. I\u2019d give you a deeepppp hug in person if I could! I\u2019d also show you all my plants and make you smell my plumerias.
