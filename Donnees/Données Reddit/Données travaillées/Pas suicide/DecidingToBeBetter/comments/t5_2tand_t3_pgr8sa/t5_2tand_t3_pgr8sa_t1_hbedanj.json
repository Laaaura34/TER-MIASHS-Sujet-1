Focusing on getting better will help get that zest back in your life. It doesn\u2019t get easier, but it might just be worth dealing with. I\u2019m not in a head space to help others right now, but focusing on getting better mentally is a lot of work. I know you\u2019re doing it, so this is a reminder to be kind to yourself and that it\u2019s okay to not want to live! I didn\u2019t for a long time, but that is not a permanent state.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgr8sa/what_to_do_if_you_dont_want_to_live/hbedanj/"}
