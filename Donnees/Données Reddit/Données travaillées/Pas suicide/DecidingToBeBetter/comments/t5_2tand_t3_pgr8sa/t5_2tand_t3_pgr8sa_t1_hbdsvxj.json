I understand what you're feeling rn because I had depression the last 2 years and although I'm better now,I still think life is overrated but I have no plan to end my life soon so what I did is...\n1. Got therapy for my depression so I can think a little clearly\n2. Start solving one problem at a time and appreciate small successes\n3. don't have progress? It's okay no one is rushing\n4. Go on vacation,or do something enjoyable (watch fun movies,read books)\n5. Do/change something drastic like applying intern or change jobs or move out\n6. Slowly accept that it is our mind that shape our view on life. Life itsef is neutral,our experience living in it is crappy but we can see it as good,surfable but not great. And no,don't ruminate on the past,I definitely don't want to rewind my life", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgr8sa/what_to_do_if_you_dont_want_to_live/hbdsvxj/"}
