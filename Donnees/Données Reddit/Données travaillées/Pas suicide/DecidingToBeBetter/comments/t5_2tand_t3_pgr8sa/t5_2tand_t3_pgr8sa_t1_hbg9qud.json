It's not so much you want to die as you don't want to live a life without purpose. Maybe you feel lost. My therapist has me working on personal, physical, mental, financial, social goals. 1 month goals, 1 year goals, 5 year goals.

I could be dead wrong and this may not be your issue at all, but I hope it helps anyways.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgr8sa/what_to_do_if_you_dont_want_to_live/hbg9qud/"}
