I read C.J.Jung, William James, Nietzsche, Marcus Aurelius, Plato, Twain, Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau and Stanton Davis Kirkham. Many I read in my youth, but now they actually resonated within me. I learned little bits and pieces from everyone of them and reconstructed my very being. I stumbled upon new teachers like Alan Watts, Ram Dass, Don Miguel Ruiz and Dr. David Hawkins. I learned the tools necessary for letting go and loving myself unconditionally. Taoism and Zen Buddhism drew me into nondualistic thinking and taught me how to meditate and be mindful throughout my day. It all came together like a stew that simmered on low heat for a really long time, adding different ingredients in at the appropriate times. The flavors built, melded and formed a rich body that was greater than any single ingredient could possibly be. \n\nThese days I know what ingredients make My stew of life hearty and whole, my recipe is unique to me, but the process, I'm sure is universal. So don't disappear or give up hope, if you don't find a cookbook or recipe that fits your life, write your own. Mess up, make mistakes, but don't feel bad about them. You can't bake a cake without breaking a few eggs, right...?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgr8sa/what_to_do_if_you_dont_want_to_live/hbep2jg/"}
