Nowadays, thanks to PC bullshit and Hollywood Blaxploitation, black people are represented just as badly as they were in the 70's.\n\nIt's easier for me personally to look at people as equal citizens. We have equal rights by law even if we have to remind others of that. I don't give a damn what colour you are as long as you treat me and others with the same respect.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1h5dky/watch_a_teacher_make_her_3rdgrade_kids_hate_each/carm8wp/"}
