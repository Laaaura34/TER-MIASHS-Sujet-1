These privileges included eating seconds at lunch, segregation on the playground, better treatment in class, and longer recess. She gives brown-eyed kids the advantage over blue-eye kids the next day so all kid experience the highs and the lows. What she noticed was that whichever group was on top would do better on activities and tease the other group (a few kids got into fights and started name-calling).Then, she explains the importance of equal treatment and how that affects us as brothers and sisters. They promised they would treat everyone equally.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1h5dky/watch_a_teacher_make_her_3rdgrade_kids_hate_each/car870s/"}
