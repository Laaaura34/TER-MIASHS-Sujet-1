Truly, thank you for sharing this. Reading about how you took time to celebrate yourself made me smile so big, and also made me think, \"Hey, maybe I need to put more of that energy in my life.\" Especially with the biking and the difference small, focused changes + believing in your own ability can make, that was really refreshing and uplifting to read.\n\nSo thank you again for sharing, and I hope your next week continues to go as well as this first one!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p3ykeg/honestly_just_a_fantastic_week/h8v6hdk/"}
