(As simple as napping, watering my garden or flossing my teeth) 2) did you brush your teeth? (It\u2019s one of my struggles) 3) did you go outside? (I hide on depression days) 4)did I eat food that shows love to my body? (In quality and quantity- I\u2019m a binger) 5) how was I productive today? \n\nIt takes 5 minutes and is sometimes still a struggle to do, but I\u2019ve noticed that my brain pings \u201cthat was good! That was nice of you!\u201d now over simple things that I would have rolled my eyes at before. Congratulating myself on brushing my teeth feels weird, but I tend to write \u201cyes!! :D\u201d by it proudly, which is just another nice thing that I did. Best of luck and sending positivity to you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p3ykeg/honestly_just_a_fantastic_week/h8vza3l/"}
