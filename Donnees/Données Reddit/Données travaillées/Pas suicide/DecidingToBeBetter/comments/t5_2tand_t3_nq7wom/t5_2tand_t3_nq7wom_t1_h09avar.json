As someone who went from spending a year in bed to working out everyday.....I know how difficult it is. I am so fucking proud of you. I hope for mental peace for you in the future. Continue the exercise, continue to treat yourself with kindness, and give as much attention to your mental health as physical health. You are amazing, you are doing so fucking well my dude. Depression and PTSD are demons that can way you down so much....everyday you get out of bed is a total fucking win....I hope you truly realize how genuinely strong you are \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nq7wom/i_have_ptsd_and_depression_and_i_set_a_goal_back/h09avar/"}
