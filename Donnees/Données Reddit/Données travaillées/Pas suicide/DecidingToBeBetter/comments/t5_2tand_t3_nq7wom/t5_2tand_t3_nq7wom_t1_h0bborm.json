I think it\u2019s darn admirable when people take the first step to change things.. exercise is really a lifesaver for my mental health too. The trouble is forcing myself to stay consistent. There are times I go stretches without exercise and when I start again I feel SO MUCH better when the endorphins kick in and all. It\u2019s like I wonder why didn\u2019t I get off my ass and do it earlier. \n\nYou sound amazingly strong. Small steps over a long time make a huge difference. Stories like yours really motivate me too. Thank you for sharing!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nq7wom/i_have_ptsd_and_depression_and_i_set_a_goal_back/h0bborm/"}
