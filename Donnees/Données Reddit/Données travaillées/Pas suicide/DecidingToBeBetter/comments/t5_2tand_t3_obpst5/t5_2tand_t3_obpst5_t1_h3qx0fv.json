It sounds like you are going to be able to recognize tough times and prepare for the next time something might sneak up on you.  My own personal signal from Heaven that I'm hitting a rough spot are terrible drivers.  I didn't realize it until a friend of mine, listening to me complain about all the &#%$# on the road asked me what was bothering me.  He said the same drivers are out there all the time.  Me noticing them and being bothered by them is my own personal signal that something is not right in my world.  Much better than the crash and burn I used to do on a regular basis.  Best of luck.  Listen to encouraging words and you might start journaling.  That helped me a lot.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obpst5/finally_made_mental_health_my_1_goal_and_reached/h3qx0fv/"}
