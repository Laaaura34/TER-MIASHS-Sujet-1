I\u2019ve moved out and moved back in and I am pretty independent at home (get my own groceries, meal plan for myself etc) and I am pretty self sufficient. My older sibling on the other hand never moved out and is pretty stunted and spoiled by my mom. She cooks all of his meals, and if she doesn\u2019t he orders take out or makes something microwave. He doesn\u2019t clean his own room, doesn\u2019t clean any of the common areas. Doesn\u2019t even change his own sheets. It\u2019s not okay to be pushing 30, living at home with your parents doing everything for you. It\u2019s pathetic and sad unless you are disabled or something. \n\nAlso the dynamic between you and your parents. As long as they are not infantilizing you or treating you like an extension of themselves then of course! But If you feel yourself being held back, treated the same way you were as a teenager, lack of privacy etc it\u2019s ok and normal to feel itchy to move out. \n\nNow if you pull your own weight and you have an adult relationship with your parents, that is great and by all means take advantage. If that\u2019s the case you are pretty lucky.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/leufcw/normalize_living_with_your_parents/gml91lg/"}
