I'm currently in university, which is free here, so that's a huge help. Also, free health care! Besides that, the government pays a kind of child support, and as my parents split up my dad had to pay child support as well. So I was able to pretty much live off of that until 18 and still get decent funds. I also live in a fairly cheap but still decent place. And I'd say I'm generally good at not spending a lot of money.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/leufcw/normalize_living_with_your_parents/gmk8tar/"}
