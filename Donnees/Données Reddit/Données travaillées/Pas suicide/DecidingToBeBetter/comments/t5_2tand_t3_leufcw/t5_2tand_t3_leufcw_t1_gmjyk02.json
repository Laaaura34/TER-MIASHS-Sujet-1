My dad lost his job and was out of work for nearly two years (it sucks being in your upper 50\u2019s and trying to find work in the tech-world). They stayed with us for about 16 months. \n\nIt was hard sometimes, but overall a net gain. The time our daughters had with them is priceless. Now they live about 10 miles down the road, and my SIL and her two boys are staying with us for a while.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/leufcw/normalize_living_with_your_parents/gmjyk02/"}
