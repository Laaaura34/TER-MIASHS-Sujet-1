Lol. But seriously, what youre doing seems like insanity...and no wonder youre depressed hun. You need to find the strength and resolve yourself to strive for more. Stop worrying about some asshat who isnt going to return your affection. Been there, done that. I get it though. But make him your best friend and move on. There are so many other people out there, even for introverts. You are worth so much more, you are stronger than you give yourself credit for. Its okay to be selfish right now. Spoil yourself rotten and dont feel bad that you dont do well in crowds. There are a lot of people who get along just fine without trying to swim in the same stream with the rest of the status quo. Maybe you are destined to be different and rise above but you havent yet because you havent detached yourself from the perceived notion of \"normal.\" Also, maybe busy yourself with other things...get a hobby, adopt a pet, volunteer...and for crying out loud, reestablish your self worth...no one can love you until you learn how to love yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gijyvm/how_can_i_be_motivated_to_change_even_when_things/fqfvi26/"}
