You are a beginning lawyer, so just be comfortable being a beginner lawyer. Everyone was there once and knows where you are, so it\u2019s better not to try to over impress as that can come off badly. I now interview and place lawyers in new jobs and I can sniff out bs a mile away. That\u2019s not impressive, and it will make me leery of your honesty. BUT don\u2019t go in the opposite direction and make excuses for being a beginner either. Just be comfortable with where you are in your profession and work forward to learning your craft. It\u2019s definitely awkward at the beginning as we don\u2019t yet \u201cfeel\u201d like a lawyer, but you\u2019ll grow into it. Hope this is helpful. Just get out there and meet people, and perhaps use \u201cI\u2019m a new lawyer and looking to meet more people\u201d as a way of introducing yourself. Perfectly acceptable (and impressive by showing incentive.) ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a6cp7a/need_a_word_from_the_wise_from_any_lawyers_or_not/ebvfxon/"}
