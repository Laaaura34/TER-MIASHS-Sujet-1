You have to ask yourself when dealing with people--and I have learned to be ruthless with this concept. \"Is someone enhancing your life or not?\" If they are not, and this includes bloodline, you drop them or at least keep them on the far outer rings of your circle. I had friends of 20 plus years that I let go. Because I realized I had nothing in common with them. They had become chaotic and toxic--or maybe the better truth is I was once toxic and chaotic and evolved. And this has nothing to do with money--it is about progression. People who are toxic and chaotic and apathetic you have to lose if you want to fulfill and advance your life. For Jim Rohn once said--you are the sum of the five people you spend the most time with.
