I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get to spend it with your friend. I can understand. My best friend of 14 years and I had a disagreement which was probably only a misunderstanding and now we don\u2019t talk at all. He got into a relationship and things with our friendship just changed. It really hurts. He didn\u2019t hit me up on my recent bday either. So your post is really insightful for me. Thank you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4acpi/i_got_past_negativity_toward_my_best_friend_with/h8ygkpu/"}
