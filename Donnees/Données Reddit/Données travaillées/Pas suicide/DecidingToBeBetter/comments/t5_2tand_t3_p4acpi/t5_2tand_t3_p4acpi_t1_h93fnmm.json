That kinda sucks.\n\nHowever, I've had parents who've forgotten my birthday, so I've never expected a friend to remember mine. If someone remembers it is a bonus I feel thankful about.\n\nIt might be a signal to expand your friend group. Find people who care about these things. \n\nI believe in making birthdays special. I go all out in making my partner feel awesome. He used to not think much about birthdays and now, a few years later, he thinks they are fun too.\n\nCreate experiences for others and your world will become happier.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4acpi/i_got_past_negativity_toward_my_best_friend_with/h93fnmm/"}
