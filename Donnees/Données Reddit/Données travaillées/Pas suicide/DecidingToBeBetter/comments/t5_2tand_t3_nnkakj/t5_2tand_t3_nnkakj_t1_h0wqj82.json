Stay blessed and wishing you a great and positive life.\n\nI can attest to this in an inverse way. I don't know why but ever since I was little I saw myself as being a complete failure, someone who would never succeed at anything, that death would be better than living etc. These concepts were so embedded in my head that they felt natural. I got into uni and flunked out because I \"knew\" I was too dumb, could never get a girl because I \"knew\" I was unattractive, never had any meaningful career because I \"knew\" it doesn't happen to guys like me. Now, at 28, I look at my life and I realise how *right* all my thoughts were and how they slowly, insidiously became reality. It's scary and utterly saddening to think that, had I thought the opposite. Really believed in what beautiful things I could have, my life would be magical.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nnkakj/life_lessons_from_the_black_sheep_of_society/h0wqj82/"}
