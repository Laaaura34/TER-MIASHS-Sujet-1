This past year has really been a turning point for me and I can honestly say that I love myself and am not only happy with my life but no longer feel like a \u201cfailure\u201d.  It is so so true that we can\u2019t ever give up on changing ourselves and trying to feel better and be better- if you had asked me five years ago I never would have believed that I could get to where I am now.
