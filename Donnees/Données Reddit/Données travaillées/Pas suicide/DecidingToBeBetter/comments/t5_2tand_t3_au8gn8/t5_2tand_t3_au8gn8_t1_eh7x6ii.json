I like cognitive behavioral therapy and she taught me acceptance and commitment therapy. Those two are the ones I\u2019ve gotten the most out of over the last 15 years. I went to psychologytoday website and looked for local therapists and went through their bios, looking for the types of therapy they\u2019re about.  It\u2019s all preference but look into CBT and ACT. See if you like the basis behind them. If so, try and find someone who practices those. Coming from personal experience with sabotaging, well, life, I\u2019d said CBT and ACT is a good place to start.
