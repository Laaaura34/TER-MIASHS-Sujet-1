Like muscles everywhere. This will take a few years of solid work but chicks will dig that body type. In the mean time, work on a career that pays well so you can gain some wealth and invest. Donald Trump is ugly as shit but money+personality= model women. This leads me to the third leg, personality. Learn to be humble, appreciate life, and live in the moment. Get good at story telling, do an improv class so you can learn to be funny on the spot. The last one is the most important because having money and a great body will get you superficial and fake women that may be attractive on the outside, but a great personality will ensure that you find someone beautiful on the inside too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ksrdx/how_do_i_accept_the_fact_that_i_am_ugly_looking/cv04y8q/"}
