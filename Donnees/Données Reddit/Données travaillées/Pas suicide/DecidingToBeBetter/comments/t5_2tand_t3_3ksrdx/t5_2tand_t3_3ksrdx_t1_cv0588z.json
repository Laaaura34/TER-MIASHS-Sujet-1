I dont know the value of attractiveness myself but I have been told and sometimes ive agreed that I have dated girls that were \"out of my league\".. The reason for this is the amount of confidence I carry around. For some reason it has enabled me to get girls that I wouldnt in a million years think I would get otherwise. But confidence is just one key to this complex puzzle. If you really have this obsession and can't do.\n anything about it money is going to help tremendously. Wealth = security which brings attractive women around like ants to sugar. Its not a bad goal to have but I promise you will soon learn that physical attractiveness will give u as much happiness as a good meal (a great but very limited time). If you need to learn this way, it will suck, but you will still be better off since having wealth is only beneficial. Hope I helped :)  \nEdit: Make sure you gain this wealth my doing something you love, this will ease your feelings of artificial inadequacy. We all want beautiful women but its our definition of beautiful that evolves with time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ksrdx/how_do_i_accept_the_fact_that_i_am_ugly_looking/cv0588z/"}
