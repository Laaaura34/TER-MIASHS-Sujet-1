Try researching a guy named Neil Strauss and check out his transformation.  I will caution you to stay away from pick-up though.\n\nI have found that the most important relationship I'll ever have is the one with myself.  When you invest in yourself physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, it radiates naturally and people will be drawn to you.  I believe this is because most people don't know how to love themselves.  Also, when you develop a genuine unconditional love for yourself, it won't matter to you what anyone thinks.\n\nLastly, I would never try to become wealthy just to get a more attractive woman.  I want them to like me for me.  It's not fulfilling at all to have to wonder if a woman will stick around if the funds run out.  I hope any of this helped, good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ksrdx/how_do_i_accept_the_fact_that_i_am_ugly_looking/cv073xs/"}
