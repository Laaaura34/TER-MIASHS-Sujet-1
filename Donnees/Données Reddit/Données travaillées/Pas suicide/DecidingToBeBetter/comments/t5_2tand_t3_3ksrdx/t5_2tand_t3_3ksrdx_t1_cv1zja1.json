Your english is excellent. Get a job using those skills, because you are going to need money for my suggestions. Do you have nice teeth? Are they white and straight? Get whitening and get braces. Save up your money for a nose job if you really think it's a problem. Get contacts instead of glasses.  Shave the mustache. Don't try to grow a beard if all you have is scraggle, clean shave every day.  Take a shower every day and use deoderant. Brush your teeth and brush your tongue after every meal. Never use cologne to cover up your body odor, take a shower instead. Wear reasonably fashionable clothing, there's a whole male fashion advice subreddit. Get to reading it. Buy some of those things you put in your shoes to secretly give you an inch of height. \nPersonality: Work on having lots of friends and be a good friend to people. Have lots of interests. Treat the ladies with respect. You are now at an attractive level 6, so landing a lady who is a 7 is no longer out of your league. However women aren't just there as your walking fleshlights, so please be kind and generous person, they are people too. Work on being a beautiful, happy person as well. People are drawn to friendly, happy people.\nAs an aside....  I am not familiar with your culture, isn't arranged marriage the norm?  Perhaps work to change the culture so that the ratios of girl babies that are born equal boys. The whole sex selective abortion thing is beyond fucked up, and leaves you with a giant sausage fest later on.
