I am scared to live alone in case I off myself but at the same time feel nothing but misery here. \n\nI like to read, to be alone, to enjoy nature, to share experiences with knowledgeable people, to learn from those wiser than me. \n\nYet I feel like a piece of shit the whole time, I don't know if I am addicted to negativity or just need to change my surroundings. \n\nAlso find it hard keeping friends and a social circle, childhood trust issue shit probably.
