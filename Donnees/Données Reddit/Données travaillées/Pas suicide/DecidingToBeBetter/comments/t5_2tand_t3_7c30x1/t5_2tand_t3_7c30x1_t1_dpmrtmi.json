I am not suggesting you have a problem with a substance, but a large part of my addiction came with no motivation, goals or at times a will to live. I get where you\u2019re at, so stuff that fear away and decide to be better.  It won\u2019t happen over night so set baby step goals to get started something that gives you a charge when completed, those baby steps grow into larger steps and so on.\n\nI am writing this just as my roommate I met in treatment just got out of bed. He doesn\u2019t really do anything but wait tables a few days a week and stay up all night and sleep all day, his new escape now that drugs are gone is video games and sleeping. I fear he might get tired of that and go back to the needle, time will tell I suppose.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7c30x1/i_dont_know_if_i_want_to_be_better_or_just_dont/dpmrtmi/"}
