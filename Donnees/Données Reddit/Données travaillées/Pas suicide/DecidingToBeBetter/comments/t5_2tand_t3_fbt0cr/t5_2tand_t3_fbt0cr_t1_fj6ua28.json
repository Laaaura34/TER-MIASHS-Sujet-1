I\u2019ve recently started using the Oak app because there isn\u2019t any sub fees and I wanted to see what benefits I could get from them before I switched to calm or headspace.\n\nIn terms of therapy I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m dead against it for the foreseeable future.  I did start seeing one a few years back for this and it was so-so. Then my dad passed away and the next session when I told the therapist her response was \u201cwell that least your other problems aren\u2019t so big anymore right!\u201d At that point I had so many emotions running through my head I just left her office and ignored any future communication from her. \n\nI ran through the event with our work based grievance counsellor and she agreed that was out of order, but it left me negative about how serious my social issues are taken by professionals", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj6ua28/"}
