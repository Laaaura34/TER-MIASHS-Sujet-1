The one where he uses the pro & con list to negotiate the price of the hall for his talk and the explanation of the letter from the shipping (?) company to the customer about late day deliveries, that was pretty decent how to sell to get what you want. \n\nOne of the bits that springs to mind I found hard to implement was the good listener bit where it talks about people being more interested in talking about themselves, so you let them talk and guide them to carry on talking, I think he uses an example about horticulture in that chapter? \n\nWhen I tried to be a good listener I felt I came across as insincere because I couldn\u2019t come up with decent prompts to keep people talking and convey I was interested with it. I\u2019d get so far and fall flat. \n\nIRL example being I talked with a guy I met at a friends bbq who worked for a company who produced textiles for heavy duty use like those used in survival equipment and safety PPE. I found it genuinely interesting and expressed this but as the conversation went on i failed to find words and ended up just going with \u201coh okay\u201d or \u201cmhmm\u201d and nodding. \n\nBy the end I\u2019d come out of it okay but felt I\u2019d ended up seeming bored or maybe like usual I was just kicking my own butt for no reason", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj704d4/"}
