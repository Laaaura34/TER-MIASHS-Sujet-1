These are all things I learned from those channels:\n\n1. Correcting my posture. shoulders back, chin straight ahead. I was at a business meeting with two colleagues who are 4 inches taller than me and buff from the gym, yet one of the clients mentioned that my body language dominated those two. Sit back, open your arms up, speak slowly and loudly.\n\n2. Do you remember the person who said \"good morning\" to you on the street three weeks ago? No? They don't remember you either, so build up confidence by greeting people on the street. Always make eye contact beforehand, and smile when you say it. It makes them feel good, everyone wins.\n\n3. I don't remember most of my smalltalk conversations with strangers. Chat them up. Waiting in front of someone in line? Say hi. On the bus? Say hi. Nothing will happen if i make a fool of myself, we'll both move on with our things.\n\n4. People are more concerned about their lives than yours. They straight up don't care if you happened to be awkward or shy. They'll move on in their lives immediately. They have bills to pay and things to do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj6hnsz/"}
