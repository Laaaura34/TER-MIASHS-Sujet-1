Love the writing style, it\u2019s more engaging and dare I say entertaining then stuff I\u2019ve tried before. Like the case study\u2019s he gives about his time in the FBI to support using them. \n\nHave only gone over the mirroring chapter a couple times, wanted to fully understand it although need to practice my late night Fm DJ voice. Tried mirroring at work yesterday, I\u2019m far from any good at it but I tried it in a situation where we had a piece of work being pushed onto my department, which either myself or the boss would have had to take on at a busy time of year and were ill equipped to handle as it should sit with the department doing the pushing. \n\nStarted off with \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and repeated the last couple words then said. Kept asking for clarity like the case study with the digital 2x back up guy case study. Then said \u201cso you\u2019re team are going to pass us this data we need?\u201d \n\nInteraction only took a couple minutes but the manager has offloaded the work onto his own team instead of us.
