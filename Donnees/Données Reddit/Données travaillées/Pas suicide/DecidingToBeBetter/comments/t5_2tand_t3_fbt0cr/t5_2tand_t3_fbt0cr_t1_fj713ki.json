I was seeing one a few years back for it and meh wasn\u2019t getting very far but then my dad passed away. Next session when I told the therapist she said \u201coh well at least your other issues aren\u2019t very big now right?\u201d \n\nI really felt like I wasn\u2019t taken seriously then by her saying that. I saw one other briefly but again didn\u2019t go very far. I had about 10 sessions and it honestly felt like no productive stuff came of it. He\u2019d give me \u201chomework\u201d to do, fill our grids with items that worried me etc and never even review them or bring it up again. \n\nNeither of them were cheap and honestly both felt like they were taking my money seriously but not my issue. With the second one I was straight and on the first session said \u201cI am nervous to talk to people, I struggle to make conversation and I want to get more confidence\u201d. \n\nThough I always wonder if that\u2019s down to how I am around therapists. I mentally see it as a transaction and come across pretty flat and matter of fact, so don\u2019t struggle in the same way I do in everyday situations. It\u2019s something the grievance counsellor at work said when my dad died. She\u2019d had referrals from colleagues about how I acted / showed my emotions but she said when talking to her I was really flat and transactional which didn\u2019t reflect what I\u2019d heard.\n\nDo wonder if the ones I saw about my social issues just thought I was making a mountain out of a molehill", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj713ki/"}
