When you have no energy to exist, showering and putting on underwear is feasible. But I ate toast for months. Didn\u2019t drink water, and couldn\u2019t even read anything for longer than 10 minutes, let alone create.\n\nIt a important to not have high expectations. Even writing a 2 line poem \n\n\u201cI feel nothing but weak,\n\nAll week I cried; when will it end?\n\nI hope for more\u201d \n\nOr whatever is enough. Scribbling a snowman on a post-it note is enough. \n\nIf all you can do is make toast, that\u2019s enough. Add peanut butter if u can. Can\u2019t even scramble or boil eggs? Don\u2019t worry. Microwave that shit. Yes, eggs can be microwaved. \n\nCan\u2019t go on a walk? How about just around your building/complex/house real quick. Out and in. \n\nIt\u2019s hard, hardest thing ever.
