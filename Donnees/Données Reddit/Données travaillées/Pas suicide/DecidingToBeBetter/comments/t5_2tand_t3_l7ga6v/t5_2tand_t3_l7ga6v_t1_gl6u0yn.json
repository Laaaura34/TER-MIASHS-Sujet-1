Did you have dreams ? Did you respect you ? We\u2019re you strong ?\n\nRemember. \n\nAnd now, where are you ? Are you happy ? Do you still have dreams ? Have you make any plan to reach them ? Do you respect you ? Are you weak ?\nI bet the answer is a giant \u00ab\u00a0NN\u00a0\u00bb. \n\nShe is a vampire, and she sucked away all of you, leaving an almost empty shell. \n\nAnd she did that by being vulnerable. Weak and in need. \n\nYou have an issue to seek validation from women, and you stumbled on the worst gruesome for you. \n \nYou need to run away from her. Now, far and fast. Through manipulation and constant gaslighting. \n\nI hope you\u2019ll think about some of these thing I am telling you. \nThat this truth is not too hard to swallow. \n\nI hope that you will eventually come to love yourself. \n\nAnd when you\u2019ll fully understand what she did to you, I hope you\u2019ll heal, and then forgive her (because monsters are created by their environnement. Be it a mass killer or a slow killer like that ex of yours).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l7ga6v/she_said_i_was_not_supportive_and_that_she_was/gl6u0yn/"}
