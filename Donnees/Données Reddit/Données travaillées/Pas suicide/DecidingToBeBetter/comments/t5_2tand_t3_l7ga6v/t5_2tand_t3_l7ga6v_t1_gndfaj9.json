It kind of amazes me how some dudes just never figure out how girls work. Your girl treated you like shit because you let her treat you like shit. Your girl stopped being attracted to you because she didn't see you as a man and your insecure pathetic sappy bullshit is NEVER going to inspire attraction from any female. Confidence is what inspires attraction. Insecurity inspires nothing except contempt. I can pretty much GUARANTEE that your girlfriend was cheating on you while you were together. I can also pretty much guarantee that she most likely turned down sex with you at least 80% of the time and even moreso the longer the relationship went on. While you were sobbing and staring at your phone wondering why she hasnt texted you back yet, she was out getting fucked by some guy who had no interest in being in a relationship with her and was completely honest and upfront about that. Some guy who would never even dream of crying over any female. Some guy who was confident and fun to be around and made her laugh, didn't let her talk down to him, and had no clue what it feels like to have a girl refuse sex with him. And if he ever found out, he would shrug, smile, take off and be fucking some other girl by the next night. Here's some solid advice for you, bud. Cocky + funny = LAID. It's a mathematical certainty.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l7ga6v/she_said_i_was_not_supportive_and_that_she_was/gndfaj9/"}
