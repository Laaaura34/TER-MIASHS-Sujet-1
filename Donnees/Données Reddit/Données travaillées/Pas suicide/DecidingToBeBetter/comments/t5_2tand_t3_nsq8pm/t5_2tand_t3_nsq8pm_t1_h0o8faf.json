It was the worst- long story short, I had a group of people I hadn't seen in a while agree to stop over to my new home after I'd moved to a new city (high school and college friends.) They thought I was still with a different boyfriend (I was not) and did not want to hang out with me. At the same time the guy I was dating decided it was a funny prank to pretend to forget it was my birthday and ignored me all day. My parents didn't call until around 8 p.m. but I was in tears by that point.\n\nBirthdays are for spending an evening with a nice meal, a movie in non-pandemic times, some expensive beer, and buying some nice new comfy clothes now. This year I splurged on fancy nail polish.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nsq8pm/spending_my_birthday_alone/h0o8faf/"}
