I love that you can have fun by yourself and feel great about it. The first time I went on a solo trip was SO liberating (but also terrifying bc it was to NYC lol). It made me realize I don\u2019t need company to have fun. Once we stop waiting for other people to come with, the opportunities increase exponentially.
