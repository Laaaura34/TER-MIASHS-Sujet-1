All you need to overcome Guilt Shaming and Judgement.. is Honesty.\n\nWe have an entire culture full of people motivated to guilt trip you.. over your heritage, your accomplishments, your work ethic, your beliefs, your boundaries, and your self interest.  All in the name of \"Caring\"\n\nFirstly, you cant help anyone.. if youre not in the position to help yourself.  Becoming honest, Becoming dependable, and having crystal clear purpose. When you achieve this, you will help everyone around you.  \n\nYou are then a beacon. A symbol.  A guide.   \n\nOtherwise you are just enabling people.  As much as people bitch about an unfair world, all it takes is a little genuine effort, and the world begins to change.\n\n**Like the sayings goes..
