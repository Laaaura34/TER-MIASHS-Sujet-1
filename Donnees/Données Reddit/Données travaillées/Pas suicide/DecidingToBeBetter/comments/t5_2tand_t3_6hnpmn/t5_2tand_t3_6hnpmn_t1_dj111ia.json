Heck, even in Canada, all the government has done is make it easier for trans people to change the gender on their ID. You're still free to misgender whoever you like, just as I'm within my rights to call you an asshole for it. \n\nIn fact, the only time the government has interfered regarding trans rights has been conservatives trying to legislate which bathrooms people can use. An issue which was totally fine before but 'small government' right? \n\nSo this whole 'slippery slope' thing is beyond absurd, those against trans rights have interfered with civil liberties infinitely more than people who simply ask (usually incredibly politely) that you use certain pronouns.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6hnpmn/jordan_peterson_aim_at_the_highest_good_tool/dj111ia/"}
