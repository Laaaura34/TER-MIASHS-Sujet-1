And in fact, this is more of a problem under the proposed bill. Before, a fully transitioned man would just use the men's room, now conservatives are mandating that they **must** use the women's restroom if they were born female, regardless of what they look like now. Not that many establishments are going to be dumb enough to enforce that but it's an incredibly hypocritical and idiotic policy.\n\nAnd yeah, maybe sometimes 'SJW's go too far but this one's on Peterson for proudly proclaiming he's happy to insult innocent strangers for some misguided principle. That's not complicated, it's  acting like an obnoxious twelve year old.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6hnpmn/jordan_peterson_aim_at_the_highest_good_tool/dj2xv9m/"}
