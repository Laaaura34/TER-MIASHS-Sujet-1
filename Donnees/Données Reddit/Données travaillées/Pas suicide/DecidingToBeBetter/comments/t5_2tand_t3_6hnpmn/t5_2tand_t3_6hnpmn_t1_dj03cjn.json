It doesn't help that the people pushing the matter are of the same ideology of equity over equality which lead to the deaths of millions in the 20th century... :/\n\nBut yeah, it's a separate issue in a sense from the topic of this video, except insofar as peterson feels that standing up against a bully and an ideology that poses a danger is part of aiming for the highest good he can at this time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6hnpmn/jordan_peterson_aim_at_the_highest_good_tool/dj03cjn/"}
