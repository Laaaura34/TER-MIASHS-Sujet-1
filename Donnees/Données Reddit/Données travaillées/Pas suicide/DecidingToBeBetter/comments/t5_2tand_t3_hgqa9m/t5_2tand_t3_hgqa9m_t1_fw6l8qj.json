I have a friend in college who's always complimenting people, and I am err basically the opposite. I feel so bad whenever I realize that I am very insecure of other people like instead of agreeing with that friend, I look for negative things about the person she gave the compliment to just to make myself feel better). After being around her for almost 5 years, I've adapted that trait of hers, and I compliment people now. However, I still feel insecure sometimes and I worry that I'm only giving a half-assed compliment to people. I just wanna be a 100% sincere and nice to people.
