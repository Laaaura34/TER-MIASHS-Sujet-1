And other issues as well.\n\nThat would be journaling which I do in the mornings vs prior to bed and just writing down what you're thankful for or gratitude...whichever you want to call it.\n\nI fully believe the more gratitude you have instilled in your brain, heart, then to your soul, the less apt you are to one up folks. \n\nAnd I obviously have the self-awareness of it. It's absolutely life-changing to shift from one-upping to genuinely showing or telling or using body language, indicating you are very happy or simply pleased for whatever accomplishment Billy Bob or Betty Sue accomplished.
