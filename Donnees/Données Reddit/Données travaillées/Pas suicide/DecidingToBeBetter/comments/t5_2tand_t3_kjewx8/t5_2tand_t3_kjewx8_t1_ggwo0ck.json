He really cares and tries which matters during COVID. I even told him I was considering another offer and he was like make sure you take it for the right reasons and are doing it because it brings you joy not because you're running away from something, but I'll support you either way.\n\nHe just doesn't have a lot of answers sometimes for me around the direction of our team and our senior leadership is often incompetent.  \n\nThe new job would make me grow exponentially and it would be a complementary skill set. The team is very smart and I like the culture and salary is generous. But there are some cons. The teams are very distributed and I thrive on in person relationships. The skill set is complementary, I would learn a lot about making changes and making quick decisions, but I want to focus more on big picture thinking. So it's like am I leaving something for something which I will might not want to stay in long term.
