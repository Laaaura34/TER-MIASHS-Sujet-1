It is possible to constantly want to improve without hating yourself. It is possible to learn to enjoy time spent alone. \n\nI actually went from feeling lonely to now enjoying time alone so much that I find it hard to make time to invest in my friendships. It was almost as if not long after I stopped needily reaching out to make friends and started focusing on myself - self-improvement, learning about what I think is important, learning what I like, devoting myself to getting better at my trade, spending time learning more about my interests - people just started wanting to be my friend.\n\nA good step one would be to cut negative self-talk out of your internal monologue. When you catch yourself talking down to yourself (e.g. I'm so stupid, what an idiotic thing to do, why did I do that, why can't I ever do X right?, etc.), learn to just stop and let it go. Basic meditation skills can help with this. Also, you could instead think to yourself, \"I'm always making the best decisions I can with the information I have at the time. If I know I did something I shouldn't have done, I now know better and can plan to do things differently next time\". This puts things out of the context of pleasing or impressing other people and back into the context of you learning what to do to be the kind of person you want to be.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3p8ack/how_do_you_feel_happy_with_yourself/cw4ey9u/"}
