Don't wait for other people's affirmations. There is nothing wrong with patting yourself on the back for a job well done.  In the beginning you will even want to exaggerate your accomplishment. When you do even small things right throw yourself an imaginary ticker tape parade. It feels funny at first but after a while you will start to see more and more things you do right. Just to be clear this is an internal dialog with yourself, I'm not suggesting you run around bragging about how great you are.\n\nOn the other side of the coin be sure to never beat yourself up over a mistake. If you make a mistake think about what you can learn from it and move on. Then if you get called out on it you will be able to say yup, learned xyz lesson there.\n\nOne other piece of advice that I liked was to work more on your strengths than your weakness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3p8ack/how_do_you_feel_happy_with_yourself/cw3zqrz/"}
