You really don't need other people's affirmations to make you happy. And also, don't always look at the flawed part of you. Always remember that everyone is flawed but we also have a bunch of amazing things that are part of us. I know what it feels like to be lonely. And i usually meditate everyday to help me deal with loneliness and contentment. But happiness, i choose to be happy regardless of how bad my day goes. I always complimented myself if i did a small accomplishment and make small goals to help me with a daily life and career i deal with all this by myself. Its not about finding the right people to be happy with. Its about finding the right kind of life that you crave for that'll make you the happiest.
