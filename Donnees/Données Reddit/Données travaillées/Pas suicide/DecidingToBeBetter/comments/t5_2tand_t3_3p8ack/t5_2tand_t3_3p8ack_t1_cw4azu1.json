It's based on my own morals and what I think defines a good person, and the qualities that I think people should strive for. Honesty, empathy, compassion, self awareness.\n\nI define success by a person's ability to benefit society as well as achieve their own personal goals, whatever they may be. I respect determination, hard work, and commitment to personal growth \n\nAs long as I am trying my hardest to work towards these traits I am generally happy with myself.
