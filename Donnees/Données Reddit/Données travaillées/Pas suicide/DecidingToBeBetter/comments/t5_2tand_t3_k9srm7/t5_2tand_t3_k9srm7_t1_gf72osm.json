I enjoyed the work mostly. The pay wasn\u2019t the greatest (ok it sucked), and there were none of your typical benefits. There were a few fringe benefits though, and all said and done, I just sort of \u201csettled.\u201d But I always had this feeling that I was being taken for granted. They constantly made me feel like *they* were doing *me* a favor by employing me, despite the fact that they absolutely needed someone in my position, I busted my ass, never was late or absent, and overall just wanted them to succeed. While I was basically broke and stuck somewhere with few friends, very limited access to my favorite hobby, and a splintered family, they lived down the road in a nice newly remodeled home that they owned, drove nice vehicles, hosted gatherings that I was never invited to, etc. \n\nOne afternoon, they asked my opinion on whether they should do something. I gave it. They did the opposite which resulted in them having to do my job for *maybe* an hour or two, for which I got bitched at via text and basically told that even though they lean on me pretty hard, I have it good and get cut a lot of slack because I\u2019m a [family member]. \n\nSo to recap, I\u2019m in a place that I hate, surrounded by people who treat me differently because I\u2019m not like them, feuding family, doing a job that wasn\u2019t what I wanted to be doing, and getting paid shit while watching them make bank off of my hard work and live it up. F that. \n\nI packed up my shit and left that night. Haven\u2019t heard from them since. I hope by now, having to pick up my duties, they realize how much I actually did. \n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far. Perhaps I should\u2019ve posted this in r/AmITheAsshole.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k9srm7/its_completely_ok_to_remove_yourself_from_a/gf72osm/"}
