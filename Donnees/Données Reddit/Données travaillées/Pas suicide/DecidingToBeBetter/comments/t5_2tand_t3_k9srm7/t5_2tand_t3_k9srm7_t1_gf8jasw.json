I think I came off a little harsh in tone. But I too have been treated like an unwanted servant by my parents. \n\nYou're definitely right that it creates a blind spot. I was blinded to mistreatment for the first 30 years of my life. I first realized the injustice when I was like 25 and it took me up until last year to finally admit to myself that my feelings of deserving better where right all along despite what my parents tried to make me believe.\n\nIt wasn't until I self isolated completely to reflect on my life that I realized it all boils down to coming to the realization that you really dont need those kinds of people in your life, even if it means you'll be alone and may feel lonely.\n\nBeing alone and knowing my worth is better than being surrounded by people that make me FEEL lonely cause they think I'm worthless without any actual evidence or truthful explanation of how that is true. \n\nI started to learn to love myself instead of trying to use how I was taught to love myself.\n\nHope this makes sense and is helpful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k9srm7/its_completely_ok_to_remove_yourself_from_a/gf8jasw/"}
