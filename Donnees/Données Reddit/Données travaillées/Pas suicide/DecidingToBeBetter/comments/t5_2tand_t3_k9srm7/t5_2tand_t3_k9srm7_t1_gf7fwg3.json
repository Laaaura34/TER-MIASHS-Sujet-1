Then, because I know it's toxic and unhealthy to assume you know someone else's intent w/o asking, I would ask them and have a conversation about the boundary to ensure they understood.\n\nNow let me ask one: How many of these people did you treat like they DO care about you and want to respect you but may just not know how?
