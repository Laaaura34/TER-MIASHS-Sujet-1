I really wish I could put the rest of my life on hold, and give my entire 16 waking hours to animation.\n\nI swear, it interests me that much.\n\nBut being with an extremely talkative family, having the dog bark at you to piss, doing maintenence work on the house, even cooking, it just throws your flow off.\n\nI'd love to know if you have any pointers for keeping the momentum.\n\nI find myself feeling hesitant to get back to work once a distraction breaks my tunnel-vision.\n\nBut thanks again, man! You should definitely make some time for it again, if possible. You can do plenty with an hour every day :]", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5erg6/i_spent_3_months_working_exclusively_on_a_single/ha8scrn/"}
