I know what you mean. People pleaser is more of a psychology term - as opposed to a \"casual term\" that can be misinterpreted about just being nice and pleasing others. \n\nThis important idea is more used to describe people who try to please everyone else to their own expense, causing long term problems. They will agree to things (when they don't want to). They will not say what they feel (even if it makes them angry or upset). It can be a real personality disorder that causes mental health issues. Avoidance of conflict,  emotional detachment. That's more where the phrase leans towards. \n\nBeing nice and sincerely wanting to help others and being kind is more about being \"altruistic\" rather than a need to \"please others.\" People-pleasing is more about manipulation to get validation - rather than just being a naturally sweet, kind, giving person - like you I probably imagine ;)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i8w7kq/people_pleasing_3_ways_to_stop_the_vicious_cycle/g1c57f7/"}
