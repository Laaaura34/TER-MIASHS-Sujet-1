No drinks :) Today is day 7. I know I can do today. Actually less than a day. 12 hours! If anybody planted the seed, it's not just me -- this sub's community really stepped in to play the 12th man. \n\nWe can do it! \n\nIf you haven't already, check out the replies people made. There's some really good moral support and strategies people have found effective. I'm definitely putting some of them in my emotional holster today. \n\nMy DMs are open, btw.
