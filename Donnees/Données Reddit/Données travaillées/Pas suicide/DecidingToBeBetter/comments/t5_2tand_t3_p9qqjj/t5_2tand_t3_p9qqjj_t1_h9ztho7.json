Your body is craving things it is not getting - so strengthen the rest of yourself.\n\nYou might want to try some MILD coffees or teas (maybe green tea) to help with the energy boosts to work thru the low points.\n\nYou need a project. Art, drawing, music... something Very Specific to think about... next steps. You need a brain distraction. Plan a garden, write a song, color an adult coloring book. \n\nI would also suggest making a motivational positive playlist. Not songs that you like to listen to when you're drinking. Make something more like a workout tape. Something that you can switch on and know that it will help your brain naturally go into a positive vibe in the direction that you want to go. Are there songs that remind you of what you are doing better?\n\nKeep playing the playlist. In a week and in a month it will mean even more to you. \n\nYou can do this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/h9ztho7/"}
