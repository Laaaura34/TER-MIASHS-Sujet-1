Your body is craving things it is not getting - so strengthen the rest if yourself.\n\nI definitely have been drinking gatorade, switched coffee to tea, and drinking more water. But I'll have to start the multivitamins for sure.\n\n>You need a project. Art, drawing, music... something Very Specific to think about... next steps. You need a brain distraction. Plan a garden, write a song, color an adult coloring book.\n\nNice. I'll have to brainstorm some smol project ideas. What's an adult coloring book btw?\n\n>I would also suggest making a motivational positive playlist. Not songs that you like to listen to when you're drinking. Make something more like a workout tape. Something that you can switch on and know that it will help your brain naturally go into a positive vibe in the direction that you want to go. Are there songs that remind you of what you are doing better?\n\nThis is a tricky thing for me bc I don't really like positive/upbeat/happy music much lol, especially when I'm low. I've just been avoiding music completely because I figured its absence could help now. It's sad bc music means a lot to me. But I'll think about looking at some of my happier playlists sometime though", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/h9zv7ol/"}
