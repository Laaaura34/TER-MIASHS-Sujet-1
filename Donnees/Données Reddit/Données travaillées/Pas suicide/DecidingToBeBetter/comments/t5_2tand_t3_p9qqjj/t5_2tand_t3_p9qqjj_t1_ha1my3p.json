After the accident I really leaned into drinking because of my chronic pain and depression. I didn\u2019t want to take opiates and thought I was a  saint for leaving them alone due to my families nasty addiction history. Well, alcohol became the problem anyway. I quit drinking 3/15/20, basically right when the pandemic hit. I was awful at first. Rage, crying, depression spells, irritability at best. I haven\u2019t had a drink since. Then I was diagnosed with a neurological disorder (SCDS) that affects my balance, so now I sorta feel drunk all the time anyway. \n\nA lot of things make me just wanna give in. The world, my own shit. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s really fucking hard and you\u2019re not going to be out of the woods for awhile. I don\u2019t have much of a support system with my family as my sobriety comes off as a threat to my New England, Irish Catholic family. I haven\u2019t even done AA, but I think about it a lot even still.\n\nI can tell you a couple things. It never stops sucking. But it gets better. As lame as it sounds, I come from a small town and the thought of someone reading my poorly written obituary in my town newspaper, somehow is enough for me to not want to be another statistic. \n\nMy advice. Start walking. Sounds dumb. Do it. Treadmill, neighborhood. Just start walking meditation. It helps with the anxiety. It sounds so stupid, but walking may\u2019ve saved my life. \n\nIt\u2019s still not easy. I have to find other ways to manage my pain, and I get anxious in social situations, but it may be that I\u2019m just getting older\u2026but I\u2019m starting to realize there isn\u2019t really a person or experience worth giving up my sobriety for. \n\nI listen to Bill Burr a lot because he struggles with this too. He put it this way. In the beginning, it\u2019s there everyday. The want to just start drinking. It fucking sucks. You sit there in a form of misery and anguish until you go to bed and when you wake up the next morning, you don\u2019t feel guilt. Eventually, it starts to go away and it\u2019s not EVERY day. And shit man, everyone is different. You will find what works for you if you\u2019re patient through it. Adopting a bit of stoicism helped me there because sometimes there isn\u2019t a way around the SUCK, you just gotta go straight through. \n\nI wish you the best. It\u2019s been really hard and I know how you\u2019re feeling. One week is really huge and you should be super proud of yourself because the first month is the hardest with the emotional rollercoaster. \n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing. You\u2019re nervous you may drink, so you\u2019re reaching out. Never stop reaching out. I commend you for this post and deciding to be better, as I know the strength it takes to stay sober. \n\nOne final thought. You\u2019ve been sober for one week and today you asked for help. Do you see how you\u2019ve already improved? You noticed something about yourself and were responsible for it and came here to reach out. If that isn\u2019t productive, I don\u2019t know what is. You\u2019re treating your sobriety with care, and you\u2019re putting your health first. I think you\u2019re doing a fantastic job and when you go for your meditative walk, I think you should reflect on how proud of yourself you should be for that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/ha1my3p/"}
