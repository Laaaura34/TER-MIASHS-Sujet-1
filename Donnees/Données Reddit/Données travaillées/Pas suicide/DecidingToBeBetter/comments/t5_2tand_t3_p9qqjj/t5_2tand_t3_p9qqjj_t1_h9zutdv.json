AA saved my life, I got sober 7 1/2 years ago at 26. The community is pretty awesome, there are meetings available virtually 24/7 online (Google AA Online Intergroup) as well as in person worldwide. I gained a lot of tools and support to help me manage cravings, navigating situations involving alcohol without drinking, and improving my mental and emotional health. Getting sober also allowed me to really be honest with mental health professionals. I got on a proper regimen of medication and did  necessary work to stabilize my depression, anxiety and OCD.\n\nI can't speak to the other recovery programs as I got sober with AA, but there is also Recovery Dharma, Rational Recovery and SMART Recovery.\nLike AA, each program has its own tools and community which can be invaluable in maintaining lasting sobriety.\n\nWe have the slogan in AA \"one day at a time\" which was my saving grace early on. Focus on not drinking today- take each day as it comes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/h9zutdv/"}
