Some can really send me on the wrong spin. Maybe wait until you start a new hobby or project and see what inspires you. \n\nNow that you mention it, I started to explore coding a long time ago for absolutely no reason and it was kind of fun. I'll try messing around with that stuff when I need a distraction.\n\n>For example, when I used to paint I liked airy instrumental themes. Not   \nthe kind of music with lyrics that I would normally listen to. Summer   \nevening on a deck? Maybe try instrumental? World ethnic themes?\n\nAhhh, I guess I have enjoyed ambient or nature noises in the past.
