Skip a day here and there. I kinda left it on autopilot until recently, making no plans for how many days I want to take off. This is my first plan for more than a couple days at a time that I've made concrete plans for. With all the supportive comments like yours, I feel really good about making it today, but my bigger goal is the rest of the month. I'll keep goin for us both :) Maybe I'll make another post when it happens", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/ha1mzvk/"}
