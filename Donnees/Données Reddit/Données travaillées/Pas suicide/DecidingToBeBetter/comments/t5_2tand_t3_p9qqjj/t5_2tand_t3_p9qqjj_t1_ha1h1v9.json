I am sorry that you have so much to contend with. I would encourage you to see your pcp. There are much better medications than alcohol to help with the issues you have. I would also encourage you to have your blood sugar levels checked as well as your vitamin B levels checked. These tend to be deficient in prolonged drinkers. Another thing you can do is extended fasting which can help repair your body from the stress of alcohol and balance your hormones. To do so you would stop eating directly after dinner and wait 16 hours before your next meal. I would not do an extended fast however unless you are completely alcohol free and if your blood sugar levels are normal. While fasting is very good at regulating blood sugar levels it should be monitored by a doctor if you have any problems with this. \n\nThe only other thing that I would suggest is to have support on hand for your more difficult times. One of the classic signs of alcoholism is the inability to regulate problems, lack of networking skills and lying about your needs for support and need for alcohol. Being honest with yourself, friends and family is very important to your recovery.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/ha1h1v9/"}
