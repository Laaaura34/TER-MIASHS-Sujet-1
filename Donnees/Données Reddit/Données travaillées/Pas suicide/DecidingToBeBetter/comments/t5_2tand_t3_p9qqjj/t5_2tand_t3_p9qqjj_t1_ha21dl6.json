However logic is universal, so you'll still find that you can satisfy a desire for solving logic puzzles with it, which is true for any programming language.\n\nUnity 3D is nice because it gives you an environment where you can experiment with very simple problems and easily create animations or visualize the results of those experiments.\n\nUnity doesn't have to be used for making games, its just what we call these engines by tradition.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/ha21dl6/"}
