I relate heavy to you. I spent a year leading a small production crew. I struggled with demonstrating leadership, and instead just barked a lot about believing in it.\n\nI've tried reading Simon Sinek's book on leadership. It helped emotionally! I didn't feel like I could take on more responsibility, but I did feel like I understood the dynamics of leadership more.\n\nSince then, I've been trying to keep a calendar organized and I maintain a mood journal to feel like I'm improving on my responsibility, but I still feel like I'm waiting on some divine moment to tell me, \"You are now responsible and a good leader again.\"\n\nI really hope the best for you after this fuck-up, and I believe in you to find the responsibility in yourself that I'm sure has always been a part of you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hx40un/i_just_had_my_very_first_fuckup_as_a_team_leader/fz3s7of/"}
