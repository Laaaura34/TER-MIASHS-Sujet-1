However, consider the following: Would you care if I kidnapped you, strapped you to a chair and then proceded to pull out your nails and then amputate toes, fingers and limbs without anaesthetics until you died from shock or blood loss? Of course you would.\n\nWhy? If you are as insignificant as you claim, surely you dying (even if the circumnstances are horrible) is just a drop of piss in the ocean, right? Well, yes and no. You care because my psycho plan would make you suffer, and *you* are really your entire universe. You may not be the least bit significant to most other goings on in the universe, but you *are* significant to yourself.\n\nNow, the same reasoning also holds for positive experiences. Just like you'd rather not get tortured to death, you'd also rather not have a less pleasant time while you're alive than any easily obtainable options. If you got a choice between eating a cheese-and-mushroom omelet for breakfast and eating a literal pile of human feces, you'd chose the omelet simply because it gives you more pleasure (or less displeasure). Again, if your argument holds and you are *truly* insignificant, you'd be indifferent between the two choices.\n\nLife doesn't have purpose, in the absolute sense. It has exactly the purpose you choose for it. If you choose to maximize your own expected pleasure, then you going to a concert or getting a degree or whatever *won't* be insignificant, because it directly furthers the meaning of life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/39jlw5/how_can_you_enjoy_life_when_we_are_a_blip_in_the/cs43c57/"}
