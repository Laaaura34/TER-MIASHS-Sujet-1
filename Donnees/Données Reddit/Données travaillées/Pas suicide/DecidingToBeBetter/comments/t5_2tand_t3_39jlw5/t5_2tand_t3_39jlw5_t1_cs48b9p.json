There is no afterlife. There is only now. Your eyes open and consciousness exists for a very brief moment. \n\nNow. Look out your window. Look at the sky. Look at the colors. Listen to the sounds. Smell. Feel. Is this not fucking amazing? And you get to exist with consciousness to experience it. \n\nIf you knew your senses were about to shut on it forever, wouldn't you want to exist for one more second? To taste one more taste of your favorite food, to see one more beautiful thing, to feel one last intense emotion?\n\nNow imagine your the life you lived on repeat. For eternity. Are you in heaven or hell? You created it.\n\nWe are a blip. An extremely privileged blip. We get to experience a miraculous variety of people, places, moments, thoughts and emotions-- some of which no one else in the world has ever or will ever repeat.\n\nDon't waste this. You have a blink of consciousness and then it will all be gone.\n ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/39jlw5/how_can_you_enjoy_life_when_we_are_a_blip_in_the/cs48b9p/"}
