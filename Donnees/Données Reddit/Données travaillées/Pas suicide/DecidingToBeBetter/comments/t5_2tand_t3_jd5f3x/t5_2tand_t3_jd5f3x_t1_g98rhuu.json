Etc. Really worth the read. The reason I HIGHLY recommend these is because they focus on emotional *neglect* which is often (and understandably) overlooked in favor of more visible issues such as physical /emotional abuse. However emotional neglect can be just as harmful as any other form of abuse and Dr. Webb Really helps you understand how to improve your emotional health and heal from your past.\n\nThings to remember on your journey of self growth \n\n- Progress isn't linear\n- Mistakes are normal and they do NOT erase the progress you have made. \n- Be gentle with yourself, you cannot shame your way into improving \n- Don't try to change every single thing at once. True lasting change is done incrementally over time.\n\n#YOU CAN DO THIS.\n#Break The Cycle", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jd5f3x/6_days_sober_just_had_the_best_day_of_my_life_and/g98rhuu/"}
