This is truthfully helping me re-shift my own perspective because I\u2019ve been kind of complacent lately. It\u2019s so beautiful to remember that we are meant to feel joy and not be stressed out constantly. Thank you for sharing your beautiful experience. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to shift into someone who cries after years of repressing what you feel or not being used to the level of emotion you\u2019re experiencing. Numbness seems like the easier way even though it actually creates harder circumstances. Just noticing how you\u2019re feeling and expressing it is such a big step. I truthfully know that now, I\u2019m able to cry way more easily when I used to just get so built up with emotions without crying. It\u2019s literally a practice that develops once you keep choosing you and aligning more with your feelings. \n\nI am so unbelievably happy for you, and I know the best is yet to come. The tears will come more easily one day, just keep expressing and allowing yourself to be vulnerable and happy. There will be \u201coff\u201d days but that\u2019s natural. Just keep remembering this feeling and that it\u2019s totally possible to feel this way naturally without any of the negative side effects of mood enhancing substances. \n\nAgain, thanks for sharing with all of us. We\u2019re all proud of you! You got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jd5f3x/6_days_sober_just_had_the_best_day_of_my_life_and/g98etg9/"}
