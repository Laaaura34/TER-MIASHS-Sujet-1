I had this struggle with music and art. But what works for me is I will do my music or work on art when watching something or even a single player game so you can pause when you feel inspired. And If you get a sudden urg to do piano or animation just do it. You will feel happy even if you barely accomplished much, also rest up. This is the time for that as well. So that way you do not always feel drained. I also will make a mental schedule for myself. Quarantine has helped me organize my life a bit. Also try making your bed every morning, or redecorate your room. Move stuff around, that always helps motivate me. Sorry I've rambled on, just giving you things that helped me a bit since most days I feel this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g0mlyn/i_want_to_improve_whilst_balancing_the_things_i/fnaiiz1/"}
