A bit like meditating? Really feeling your sensations and noticing \u201coh, I don\u2019t really feel like eating anymore\u201d. If we\u2019re distracted watching a movie we could probably keep eating compulsively. \n\nThis might also help you notice why you want to eat that much and then help fixing the root cause. \n\nAnother thing to note is that it\u2019s actually really hard objectively (that might give you some compassion) because when we overeat again and again the hormone in charge of signalling to our brain that we\u2019re full stops working properly. So give it some time to recover :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f90zlc/what_if_i_stopped_eating_after_i_was_full/fioty5k/"}
