Don't fall for it. He sounds like an abusive, manipulative narcissist. Break off all contact or he will succeed in reeling you back in.\n\nDo not give him another chance. He'll be on his best behavior for a while then back to his abusive self.\n\nWith each go-round he'll do more damage to your mental health and self esteem. Stay away from him completely.\n\nDo some research on narcissism, join a support group for its survivors, find some memes on Pinterest about it and save them to your phone.\n\nStay strong. And stay away from him.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pp4ny8/i_broke_up_with_my_bf_but_its_difficult_to_cope/hd19xek/"}
