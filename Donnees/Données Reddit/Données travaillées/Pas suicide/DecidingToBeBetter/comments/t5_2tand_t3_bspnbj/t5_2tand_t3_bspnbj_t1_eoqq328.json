You did the right thing given the information you had at the time. When presented with new intel, you questioned and responded accordingly, which gave you new insight going forward. \n\nMy only caution is not to accept responsibility that isn't yours. You state had you known then what you now know, you would've applied empathy. You behaved accordingly back then. It was not your job to research the why of her behavior. You didn't merely cut her off, you had a conversation then moved correctly. There was nothing more you could do at that time. I'd be concerned that victims are setting themselves up for abuse otherwise.\n\nBottom line: you both learned and grew, thanks to your maturity. Now is when you apply empathy.\n\nThanks for sharing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bspnbj/had_a_realization_today_on_how_to_deal_with/eoqq328/"}
