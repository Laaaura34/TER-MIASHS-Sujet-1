Winding down with a bath, tea, book, can help your body know that it\u2019s time to sleep. Only use your bed for sleeping, sex, and when you\u2019re sick. Minimize screen time before bed as much as possible. Keep waking up at the same time every day (yes even weekends), even if your parents have to wake you up, and don\u2019t take any naps. It may take some time for your body to adjust but you\u2019re already doing a lot of the right things (no caffeine late in the day, no drugs/alcohol). Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mnc4eb/improving_my_sleep_schedule/gtz1ud3/"}
