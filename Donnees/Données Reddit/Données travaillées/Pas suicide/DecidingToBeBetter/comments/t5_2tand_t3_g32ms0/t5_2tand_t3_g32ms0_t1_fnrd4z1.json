I don\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy. To be at your lowest point and also have people look at you like you belong there just makes you feel like there\u2019s no point to even being alive. There is no joy. No happiness. No confidence, no self esteem. Only severe depression and shame. Shame that you\u2019re in the place you are, and embarrassment because people look and talk to you like you did it to yourself and deserve to be there.\n\nEven today I hear friends talk about homeless people like they are pieces of shit grubbing off of the people and begging just for drugs. \n\nThe people on drugs and in that situation are in a sad life too. They are victims of their own choices. \n\nBut the people that are there due to eviction? Unemployment? Family abuse? Warped childhoods? I give my heart to them. The strength they have to still live each day is beautiful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnrd4z1/"}
