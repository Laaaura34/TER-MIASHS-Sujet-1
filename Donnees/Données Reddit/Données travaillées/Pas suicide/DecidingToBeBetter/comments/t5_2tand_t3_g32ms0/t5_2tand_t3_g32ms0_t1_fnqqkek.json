You making good use of your time or taking leisure time doesn't better their situation. I guess people equate making good use of that time as a way of relieving guilt, despite it not changing the situation of the people struggling. Not meaning anything against you just interesting to follow the logic on that. I've definitely felt something similar before but never analysed it before.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnqqkek/"}
