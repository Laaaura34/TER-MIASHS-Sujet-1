I still work and all, but the simplicity of life has shown me how much stress I've accumulated from the constant go go go toil of life. I've healed so much in this time by being \"unproductive\" and embracing that break. I found a lot more time for creative projects, That doesn't mount too much more than a bunch of \"bad art\" but I've never felt more fulfilled. However I watched a lot of TV shows and scroll through a lot of Facebook before I started doing this.\n\nBottom line, we are all different people living different lives. I'm glad the OP found something that motivates them to be with a consider better. I've also found motivations to be better. But my \"being better\" looks a lot different than their \"being better.\" I don't think that anyone should feel ashamed for that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnqajlp/"}
