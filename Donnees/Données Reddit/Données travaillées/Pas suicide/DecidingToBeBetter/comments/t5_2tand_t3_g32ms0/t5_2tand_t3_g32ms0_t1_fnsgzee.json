It's immensely difficult to self-isolate when you are in a building with 30-50 other people sleeping on cots or mats. One of the shelters I work at serves a meal to the community twice daily and those numbers have significantly risen during this time while people are financially struggling to support themselves and their families. All I can say is, count your blessings. And PLEASE consider, if you are able, donate to your local shelter or foodbank - they are in need.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnsgzee/"}
