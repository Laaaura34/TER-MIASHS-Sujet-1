Just because work or school is paused for the time being, doesn't mean you have the greenlight to do nothing. If anything, as long as you're not physically or mentally ill I think everyone should spend at least 2 hours of the lockdown improving themselves every day, preferably 1 hour on their body and another on their mind. Use your commute time to work to go for a run.  Use your commute back to try learning a new skill or language. Not trying to force anyone to spend like 12hrs a day improving themselves (as some people somehow assumed I said when I said similar things before), but scrolling through insta and rewatching the Mandalorian for the 7th time is probably less fulfilling than learning Python or running a 5K.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnpdagl/"}
