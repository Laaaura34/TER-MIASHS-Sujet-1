Not really. My life isn't any better by making others fall into self-contempt, and that's not what I was saying. I just wanted to share my experience with self improvement and how obsessing with it can make you worse off, read these two comments because I already explained it.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if\\_you\\_can\\_afford\\_food\\_and\\_have\\_a\\_roof\\_to\\_sleep/fnp12jw/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnp12jw/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if\\_you\\_can\\_afford\\_food\\_and\\_have\\_a\\_roof\\_to\\_sleep/fnplho9/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnplho9/)\n\nYou're seriously paranoid if you actually belief someone can be so narcissistic to keep people down for his own advantage, specially when most people reading my comment aren't even from my country most likely. I'm just someone trying to give others the help I didn't have when I needed it and sharing what took me a lot of pain to learn in hope others don't have to go through it.\n\nThere's a big difference between \"don't bother improving and settle however you are right now\" and \"don't feel guilty for being lazy AT TIMES\".
