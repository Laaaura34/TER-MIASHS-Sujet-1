I was struggling with depression and daily anxiety attacks before the lockdown, but now my mental health has gotten even worse. I can\u2019t fall asleep until I pass out from exhaustion because every time I close my eyes for more than a minute, terrible thoughts and feelings find their way into my head. The sims has been a great help. I was up until 6 in the morning yesterday building a bar for my sims. I started a new challenge this morning where I have my sim a tiny house on the biggest lot, took away all her money, and gave her dreams of being a famous abstract artist with a modern mansion. We are slowly getting there. Every time she makes a decent chunk of money from her paintings and job as a painter, I add another addition to the house. The front looks great, the back is really flat and sad-looking, but that\u2019ll change once we get more money coming in.\n\nUsually I\u2019d just cheat for extra money to make a bigger house, but this quarantine has inspired me to take things slow and build up a house over time. I think it\u2019s given the house a lot more character than if I had built it all at once.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnrcxmq/"}
