Our brains respond to threats, crises, anxiety, etc, with the fight or flight response. Because we can't see a virus to fight it or run away from it, our brains may cope by going into shutdown mode. This means increased drowsiness, lethargy, mild body aches, etc. It is awesome that you want to be more productive, but please be gentle with yourself. Your mental health is important!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnp8lnh/"}
