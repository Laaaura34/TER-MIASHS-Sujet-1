I found that if I'm depressed, I can get out of it by getting things done.\n\nSo I got my bike out of the garage that I've not used in about 7 years because I never liked it much. So I changed the handlebars, stem, grips, derailleurs and brakes. It feels like a much better bike and I've learned a lot about fixing bikes in the meantime.\n\nI've made a start on the garden as well and found that I actually like landscaping.\n\nI've only been shopping one day a week and that's stopped me wasting money, as well.\n\nI think a lot of people will be using the lockdown to initiate a career change. That's something I'm considering, too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnpyud4/"}
