As I said it's something that is probably out of my reach to help my parents, but at the same time it feels impossible for me to just forget and try to focus on myself, and even If I'm trying to do it and spend some time with my friends there goes \"sassy\" me.  \n\n\nI will try to take your advice to heart, and will just give myself some more time.
