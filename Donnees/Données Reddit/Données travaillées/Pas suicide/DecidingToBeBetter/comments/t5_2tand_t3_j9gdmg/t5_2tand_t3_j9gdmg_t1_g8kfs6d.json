I used to play with and walk shelter dogs, I've also done some work with the homeless. I appreciate the advice but that kind of thing hasn't really helped me, which is a terrible thing to say, but if I'm honest I go on feeling just as empty, despite knowing I am of some use. Most human interactions I have feel like they are viewed through a screen. Outside of human touch I find it very hard to feel an other person and their emotions. I might recognize what's going on, and part of my mind is telling me yes you should care about this, this persons grateful, hurting etc. but its someone else's voice  its more in an approval/validation seeking way, ie society will frown upon you if you don't care.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j9gdmg/my_lifes_too_easy_its_ruining_me_how_do_i_get/g8kfs6d/"}
