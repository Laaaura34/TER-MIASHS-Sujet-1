My overall suggestion is this:\n\nStart waking up at the same time every day. It can be 9:30 or 10:00 or later, but make sure you\u2019re waking up at the same time. It will encourage a regular bedtime and sleep schedule. If you want to, you can then more easily change your sleep schedule, because you\u2019ll feel more rested when your sleep is more regular.\n\nDo one thing first. If you have to fold the laundry, tell yourself you\u2019re just going to hang one t-shirt. The hardest part about big tasks is that they seem insurmountable; doing the very first part is a good way to trick yourself into getting more done. And even if you can only do one t-shirt - that\u2019s more than would\u2019ve gotten done otherwise! It\u2019s a first step, and that\u2019s better than nothing.\n\n\nAnd, just additional advice: know that self-care is different than self-indulgence. If you\u2019re overworked and stressed, self-care can be a bubble bath or time relaxing. However, if you\u2019re relaxing and scrolling social media anyway, self-care might instead be getting a chore done or taking a shower. It may not be fun, but it\u2019s a better way to truly care for yourself than trying to make yourself feel better sitting around relaxing. Often, I find it makes me feel worse - I put all my effort into doing something enjoyable, and I have to actively ignore other things I know I should be doing. That\u2019s just me though, your situation may be different.\n\nAnd best of luck!!
