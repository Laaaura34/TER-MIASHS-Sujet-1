We do not live in a static universe.  \n\nThe big question is \u2013 will you accept yourself as you change, or will you only accept yourself once you have changed?\n\nMany people follow the latter example.  Those people are always chasing some goal they think will make them happy.  The problem is that there\u2019s always another goal, so they\u2019re never quite happy. \n \nInstead, just accept yourself as you are right now, including your imperfections.  That way, you won\u2019t fall into the trap of comparing yourself to other people... or possibly some imagined \u201cyou\u201d from the future or past.  \n\nSelf-acceptance doesn\u2019t mean sitting around doing nothing.  Self-accepting people are still allowed to have passions.  And if you follow those passions, you\u2019ll still change, grow, and move forward.  The difference is that you\u2019ll be happy while you\u2019re changing, not just afterwards\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8gz1cv/what_are_some_experiments_i_can_try_to_help_me/dygsqur/"}
