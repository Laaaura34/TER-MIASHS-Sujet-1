You created an image in your head that represents who you thought you were, then did a comparison.  \n\nThat can be a very slippery slope.  Do you remember how energetic you were as a youngster and compare that to your now aging body?  Do you compare bank accounts from then and now?  Which previous version of yourself are you conjuring up to compare?  It really is nothing but a head game.  \n\nInstead, stop playing games.  Just be happy with who you are in this moment, and accept yourself no matter what.  No comparisons to others or to some conjured-up version of yourself.  Like I said, it may sound counterintuitive, but it simplifies life and makes it easier to move forward.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8gz1cv/what_are_some_experiments_i_can_try_to_help_me/dygjf9u/"}
