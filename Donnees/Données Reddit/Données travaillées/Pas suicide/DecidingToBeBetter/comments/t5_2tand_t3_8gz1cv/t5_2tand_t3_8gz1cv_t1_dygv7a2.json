You might be having trouble finding the next thing because it isn\u2019t here yet. You just learned some lessons and reflected, now you need to master this level. Live it, enjoy it, employ it in your life. When it comes time to learn the next thing, it will be obvious. You\u2019ll complete this cycle a hundred times over the course of your life. I guess it is not as linear as leveling up, because there is no \u201ctop level\u201d, you 100% will \u201clevel down\u201d at some point, and \u201cleveling down\u201d is kind of necessary to learning other lessons. \n\nThere is no right or wrong way to be in the world, so there is no true best self.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8gz1cv/what_are_some_experiments_i_can_try_to_help_me/dygv7a2/"}
