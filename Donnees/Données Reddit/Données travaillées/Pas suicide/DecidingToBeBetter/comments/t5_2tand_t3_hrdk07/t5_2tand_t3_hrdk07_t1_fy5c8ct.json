Yes, depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, but that chemical imbalance can be induced and accelerated by a bad job or stress/anxiety. Imagine a job where your boss screams at you for hours every day. Even if you went into that job feeling content with life, your brain still has to adjust and cope with its new reality of being under constant stress at work almost every day of its life. That alone can start a chemical imbalance that will worsen if poor coping mechanisms are used as a substitute for proper introspection and acceptance. The solution isn't usually to say, \"well depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain so I'll let it sort itself out while I continue to live my life as I have before\", it should be more like \"I'm going to take small steps to improve the areas in my life that I have control over, and think about how I can address the situations that are giving me intense anxiety or stress\". I have constant problems with depression so I know how hard it can be to start those first steps and take a hard, honest look at your own reality. Took me several months to figure out why I was going through my last depressive episode (ended up being related to repressed childhood trauma that was causing productivity issues and a reluctance to express my own feelings and thoughts).\n\nFor others, it is purely a biological issue.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrdk07/quit_social_media_drugs_alcohol_video_games/fy5c8ct/"}
