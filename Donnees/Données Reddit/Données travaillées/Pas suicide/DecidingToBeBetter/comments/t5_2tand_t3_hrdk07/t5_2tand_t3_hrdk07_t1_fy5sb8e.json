As far as I understand and was taught in school, most forms of depression cannot be purely attributed to a chemical imbalance. I personally think it\u2019s best to think of it as a mal-adaptive wiring pattern in the brain, rather than a chemical imbalance. However, the role of benzodiazepines, SSRI\u2019s, and other medications are used for treatment of debilitating symptoms, and when CBT and other therapies seem to be ineffective. I believe the fields of psychology and neuroscience are moving towards these types of definitions of mental illness; \u201cConnectomics\u201d is the subset field of neuroscience that these points essentially fall under and was heavily emphasized in my 2 neuro courses.
