Just want to remind you to truly need to kick any drug habits you have recreational or otherwise if you are serious about pharmacy as a career. To gain work as an intern and to engage in practical experiences, you will be drug tested. As a pharmacy employee, you or your whole department can be randomly tested at any time. If you have any drug or alcohol charges against you during or after school, you risk losing your license and career. People who abuse substances should not have the type of access to drugs that pharmacists do. It\u2019s a stressful career and you need to have a clear mind to keep your patients safe.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrdk07/quit_social_media_drugs_alcohol_video_games/fy49kbl/"}
