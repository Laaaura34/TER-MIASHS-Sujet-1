I'm not sure why that would be necessary, unless you happen to get one who \"doesn't believe\" in ADHD or thinks it doesn't count because \"you're too intelligent\". But if that's the case, they're probably not going to do it anyway. My advice would be, fight your corner.\n\nOf all things, what got me into therapy as an adult was Tik-Tok! I kept getting videos along the lines of 'If you grew up in a household where X and Y happened, you probably felt constantly anxious and are now hyper-aware of other's emotional states and feel like their emotions are your responsibility. You probably also find even minor conflict extremely distressing...\" You get the idea.\n\nI thought Tik-Tok was just dancing teens, but turns out once you've searched for a few relevant things (for me it was ADHD), the algorithm can serve up truth bomb after truth bomb, like finding out what you thought were personality traits are actually trauma responses.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oomlh9/im_finally_seeing_a_psychiatrist_this_friday/h60ayxa/"}
