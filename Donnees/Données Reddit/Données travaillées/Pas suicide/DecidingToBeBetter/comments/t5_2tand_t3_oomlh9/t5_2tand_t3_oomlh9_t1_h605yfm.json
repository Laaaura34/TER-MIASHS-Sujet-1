Doing this is their bread and butter. It\u2019s important that you feel comfortable telling them your thoughts as well as then they are able to either confirm them or explain to you why they think differently as this may out your mind at rest and help you feel listened to instead of feeling as though they haven\u2019t addressed your ideas, concerns and expectations.
