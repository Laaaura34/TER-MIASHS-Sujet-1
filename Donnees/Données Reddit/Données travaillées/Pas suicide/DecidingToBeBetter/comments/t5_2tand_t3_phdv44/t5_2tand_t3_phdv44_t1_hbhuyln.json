Alcohol is poison and this is coming from someone who likes to drink. I, like you, had my first drinks in adolescence and have a \"switch\" that gets flipped after only one drink. \n\nMy advice to you is: Don't beat yourself up. If you haven't drank in a year, you're going to have a VERY low tolerance thus a switch which is easily flipped. I don't know what you drink but beer, like weed, is much stronger than what our parents generation is used to.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phdv44/accepting_that_i_have_a_drinking_problem/hbhuyln/"}
