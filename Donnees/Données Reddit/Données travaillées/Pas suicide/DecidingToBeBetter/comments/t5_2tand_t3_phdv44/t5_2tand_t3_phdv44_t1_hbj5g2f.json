I\u2019m active over there and it\u2019s helped me tremendously. I\u2019m not so concerned with labels as far as alcoholic or not, I just know that I couldn\u2019t ever have just one drink and I was using alcohol to cope and it was ruining my life. My life isn\u2019t all rainbows and unicorns now but boy am I handling it better, I\u2019m working out for the first time in 8+ years, I\u2019ve developed some healthy coping skills, I\u2019m a way better mom, my health is better, and it\u2019s really freeing not having to do damage control every morning about all the stupid shit I did/said/posted while drinking. Often times getting sober makes the people around you examine their relationship with alcohol which can be uncomfortable for people, but that\u2019s a them-problem not a you-problem. Best of luck and IWNDWYT! (I will not drink with you today).\n\n-HC (263 days)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phdv44/accepting_that_i_have_a_drinking_problem/hbj5g2f/"}
