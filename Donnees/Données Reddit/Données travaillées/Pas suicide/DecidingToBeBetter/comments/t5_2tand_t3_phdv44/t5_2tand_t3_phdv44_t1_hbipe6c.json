Been sober for a few years here. First off, recognizing that there's a problem is HUGE. The way I've stayed sober is through a 12 step program (which may not be everybody's cup of tea) but also through finding like minded people who were able to enjoy life without alcohol. Once I was able to surround myself with people who were also on similar paths, it made life a hell of a lot easier. Life is not over when you get sober- this is just the beginning. Some pretty good shit goes down in sobriety. Good luck on your journey!.  Edit to add: you don't have to necessarily identify as an alcoholic to want stop drinking. You decide when you want to stop and for what reasons :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phdv44/accepting_that_i_have_a_drinking_problem/hbipe6c/"}
