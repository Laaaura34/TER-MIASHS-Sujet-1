I was on the fence at one point as to whether or not i was an alcoholic- had a job, an apartment, a boyfriend, and i was only 26. I wasn't really a daily drinker, more of a binge one. For me, the truth came when I realized once I started, I couldn't stop. And I was going to crazy lengths trying to control my drinking- switching to wine, only bringing cash to the bar, eating/not eating before drinking, volunteering to be DD, only drinking at home..still, it ended with me drunk. Ultimately it's a call only you can make, whether you are an alcoholic, a problem drinker, or just in a tough spot. I tried many ways to stop drinking when I was younger, the only thing that has worked for me to stay stopped in my case was AA. I hope you find whatever support you need, whatever that looks like. You are worth it!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phdv44/accepting_that_i_have_a_drinking_problem/hbj5knk/"}
