You might be an alcoholic. An alcoholic doesn\u2019t necessarily drink everyday, drink I\u2019m the mornings, withdraw or develop physical addiction what have you what have you. \n\nAn alcoholic is someone who when they have one drink has a switch flipped and their brain no longer remembers that they were having one, they just want to drink more. That\u2019s what an alcoholic is and the first step to not drinking is to kinda work towards accepting you might be an alcoholic. \n\nThe second thing I know is gunna suck to hear but ya gotta hear it is unless you change people, places, and things it\u2019s gunna be real hard to stop drinking with consistency (as I think you\u2019re finding out)\n\nMy advice would be to look into a drug/alcohol recovery program - whether it\u2019s AA, a rehab, an addictions counselor, refuge recovery (Buddhist based AA), or something of the sort. \n\nEven if you aren\u2019t an alcoholic, you drink and act like one so it\u2019s their solutions that will help you stop that\n\nIt\u2019s not even a commitment. No one will hunt you down if you stop going to AA or if you AMA at a rehab, there\u2019s no harm in exploring these things\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re vulnerable and having a moment of clarity, seize that as soon as you can before you have to wait another who knows how long to have that again\n\nThat would be my advice, stay tuff\n\nEdit: I\u2019ll also throw in, it turns out I wasn\u2019t an alcoholic. I can and on occasion do drink normally now. But in order to heal it took 5 years of sobriety, a lot of treatment, a lot of AA meetings, and a lot of self reflection. It also took me living and recovering those 5 years as someone who identified as an alcoholic. They only reason I don\u2019t now is I no longer fit the criteria. I had a lot of underlying mental health issues that needed a lot of chipping away at. \n\nI don\u2019t say this to give you hope youll one day drink normally, but to give support that even if you aren\u2019t truly/genetically/mentally/permanently  An alcoholic - their solutions are the ones that will help. And it will help to accept you may not ever be able to drink again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phdv44/accepting_that_i_have_a_drinking_problem/hblof0i/"}
