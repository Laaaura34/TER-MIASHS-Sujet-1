Lay in bed watching re runs of shows I\u2019ve already seen a million times.. I\u2019m a recovering addict and have just gotten used to being a recluse.. I\u2019d love to start going to the gym and doing things like traveling or exploring nature. \n\nI know what I want to do and what I need to do. Just can\u2019t seem to execute on these goals.. Any tips on getting motivation to make these changes? \n\nThat\u2019s an awesome accomplishment, and am happy to hear you\u2019re where you want to be in life (or at least are on the right path). Never underestimate the mental/physical strength it takes to pull yourself out of a rut. Keep up the good work!
