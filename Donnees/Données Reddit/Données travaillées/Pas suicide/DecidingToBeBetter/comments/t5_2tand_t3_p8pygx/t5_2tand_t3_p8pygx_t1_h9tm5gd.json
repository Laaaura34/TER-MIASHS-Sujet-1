I finally got over that bad habit a few months ago and never get the urge to bite anymore.\nHow I did it was; I got my sister to put on some fake nails over my own ones. They are clear and glue onto ur real nails and u can trim them and file them down so people can't even tell ur wearing them. When u bite them they taste yuck and u don't get the satisfaction that u get when biting ur real nails. Although i did rip the fake nails off a few times and thats super satisfying to do. \nAfter like a month or two of wearing those fake nails, I guess my brain just lost the urge or habit of biting and I have only bitten like 3-4 nails in months. Try that if you feel like it, my nails are lovely now finally.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8pygx/i_pretty_much_done_a_360_on_my_life_and_i_feel/h9tm5gd/"}
