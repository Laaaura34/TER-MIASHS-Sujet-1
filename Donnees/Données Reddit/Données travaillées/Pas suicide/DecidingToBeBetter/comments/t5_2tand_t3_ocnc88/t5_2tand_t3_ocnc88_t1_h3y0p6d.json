I've been sat here trying to watch fun or engaging videos on YouTube but I will still flicker back to my breathing every 10 seconds... that's the side effect I'm most afraid about. If the medicine makes that worse, which I could easily misunderstand if my anxiety causes more panics. It's a dark place in my mind at the moment. Not depression, or not currently, but more like fear to touch it... \n\nIf the doctor's are right and it is purely anxiety then I haven't a clue why it's got me still with laboured breathing and fatigued after a few days. My usual attacks end after 5-30 minutes. I'm convinced acid reflux /GERD must also be at play...\n\nI've also got a muscular chest pain just above the heart which doctors have said is a muscle spasm, but... ya know, anxiety makes me feel like it's not just the muscle spasm. Although I have had it for months now and it's only this week it's been constantly reminding me it's there.
