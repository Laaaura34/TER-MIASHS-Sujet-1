Lexapro was the first antidepressant I was placed on, alongside Ritalin and eventually Adderall to address my ADHD.

Wellbutrin took some time to get used to, but it has almost no sexual side effects and doesn't make me feel too mellowed out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ocnc88/asking_to_be_put_on_antidepressants_changed_my/h3x9zxs/"}
