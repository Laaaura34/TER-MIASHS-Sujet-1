And back then, my ex couldn't and wouldn't understand it. So I was on a \"on-off\" period just to please her. It really helped the ADD for me but at what cost.  \n  \nNow she's an ex; so whatever. Now I use vivance for ADD and wellbutrin for the depression. Man did it help! I feel like i am back to my early 20's in term of libido and energy in general. Tough vivance feels kinda weak for my ADD, but it's still better than not using anything.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ocnc88/asking_to_be_put_on_antidepressants_changed_my/h3xkfw0/"}
