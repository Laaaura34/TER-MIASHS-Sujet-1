I usually just aim for three meals sometimes with a low-calorie snack between. I eat breakfast at work most days and that's usually between 400 - 600 calories, then I get home in the early afternoon and have lunch. If it's a big lunch, I'll have a smaller dinner, and vice versa. It's easier now that I'm used to it. I'm not even really changing my diet too much, other than cutting out fast foods and some junk food, I'm just having smaller portions of what I normally would have, spaced out so I don't just eat a huge meal then can't have anything else for the rest of the day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o91gjm/i_managed_to_lose_20_pounds_in_12_weeks_ive_been/h38npex/"}
