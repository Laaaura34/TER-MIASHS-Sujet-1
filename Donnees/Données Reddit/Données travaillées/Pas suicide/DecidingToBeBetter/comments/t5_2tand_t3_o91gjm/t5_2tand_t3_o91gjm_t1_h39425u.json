My mom died March 22nd, so it's been a 3 months and a week. It was out of nowhere and really traumatizing, and I guess in my head there was just this memory of her wanting us to get healthy together. She was always saying that but neither one of us ever really committed to it. There are days where I'm really just like, \"fuck it, none of this matters,\" then I have a day like today where I feel motivated. I miss her a lot. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. Thank you for sharing, I'm proud of you and I'm sure if your mom was anything like mine, she was already proud of you. I hope we can both live worthwhile lives.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o91gjm/i_managed_to_lose_20_pounds_in_12_weeks_ive_been/h39425u/"}
