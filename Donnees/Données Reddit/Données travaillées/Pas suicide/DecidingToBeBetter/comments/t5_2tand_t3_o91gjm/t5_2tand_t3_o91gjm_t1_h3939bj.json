Yeah, at the beginning I was looking through all these programs like, \"Okay, this one? or that one?\" and I'd do it for a few days in a week then stop. I started to get really discouraged, but I kept up with the diet changes. I'm glad I've made some progress, just have to be kind to myself. I'm doing this for me.

I'm happy for you, good job!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o91gjm/i_managed_to_lose_20_pounds_in_12_weeks_ive_been/h3939bj/"}
