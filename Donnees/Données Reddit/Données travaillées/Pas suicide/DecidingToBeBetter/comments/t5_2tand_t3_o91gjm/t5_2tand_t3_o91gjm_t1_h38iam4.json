Then one day I decided to stop and all my improvements in life were tiny steps. They add up.\nThe thing that helped me the most in losing weight was intermittent fasting and daily walks (from 15 minutes of walking to sometimes doing 20 kilometres).\nAs long as you do something you already won. \nAlso I like to reflect from time to time and compare myself to the version of me who would have done nothing.\nIntroducing small activities like reading 10 minutes daily ends up making a big difference on the scale of an entire year! \nI hope you'll find some more inspiration in the comments and congratulations for seizing control of your life bud.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o91gjm/i_managed_to_lose_20_pounds_in_12_weeks_ive_been/h38iam4/"}
