By the time I was ready to make changes I was so overwhelmed and I had always had difficulty getting myself excited to work out. So I started walking everyday. Started at 20/30 minutes but really just let my mind and body tell me. I also found a great friend who would walk with me and that made all the difference. We were able to talk about my grief and work through so many things together and over about a year and a half with walking and watching what I ate I lost all the weight. People ask sometimes what I did expecting some crazy diet or insane workouts but I know for me the ability to be consistent with something I didn\u2019t hate was way more important than something super difficult that I would have given up on. Good luck on your journey and I\u2019m so sorry about your mom.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o91gjm/i_managed_to_lose_20_pounds_in_12_weeks_ive_been/h3bfyxu/"}
