If you're looking for permission to change feelings, circumstances you may not get it. Acknowledge that you didn't like it and make some decisions.   \nBy avoiding dealing with the traumas in your life, just keeps them constant in my opinion, as they colour every thought - they are a constant hum in the back of your mind, so you do things that quieten them for a time but ultimately don't work. I would suggest therapy/counselling - you're too far into the rabbit hole to do it alone. I have undertaken emotional freedom technique \\[AKA EFT or tapping\\], hypnosis and have heard some great things about EMDR \\[*Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing*\\]. These strategies, in my opinion, produce rapid results \\[a godsend for someone who is avoiding facing issues\\]. My first session of EFT with a psychologist was staggering - I felt so light and unencumbered, I wondered if that was how happiness felt.  \nIf you're looking for validation with another person to make changes, choose someone who is going to definitively help you make changes. Your friend may see nothing wrong with the choices that were made - which I can only imagine, causes you then to do nothing with the insight you are experiencing at the moment.   \nDo some research into therapists and what they offer. Make an appointment and keep it, no matter what your mind tells you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ju6l0q/i_fucked_up/gcasw7d/"}
