You literally aren't seen for who you are, and that's just... it can flow over into other areas of being misinterpreted and feeling like your authenticity isn't recognized. \n\nIt's much less about whether they praise you or damn you - and more that even if someone hates you, they hate you for the wrong things, or even if they praise you, they praise you for parts you shouldn't even have and feel like shit about. \n\nIn the sense of positive/negative I really couldn't give much of a shit. But I give a shit that I'm hated or loved for who I really am. \n\nThanks though.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mzo1je/nothing_to_improve_for_dont_feel_like_furthering/gw5alhr/"}
