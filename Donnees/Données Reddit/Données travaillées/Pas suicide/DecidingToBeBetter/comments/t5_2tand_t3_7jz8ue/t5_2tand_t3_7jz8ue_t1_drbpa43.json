I\u2019m glad you keep getting on top of your difficulties. \n\nThere\u2019s a bit of a theme across all of these aspects of self improvement. It\u2019s staying switched on. Keeping the more advanced parts of our brains engaged and out of autopilot. \n\nFor example, at work, I periodically fall into a responsive mode. Tasks flow in and I tackle them largely at random. The outside world \u201chappens to me\u201d and I am its victim. Solving this means using systems, capturing incoming tasks, and buying time to reflect and plan. At this point we are projecting ourselves into the world rather than being its victim. \n\nSimilar then with emotions. One day I will take offence, the next I\u2019ll be aware enough to notice it either wasn\u2019t intended, or it that even if it was, it isn\u2019t worth fretting over. \n\nI lapse all the time, catch myself, and improve. But periodically I lapse for a longer period, get down about it, then eventually push back and fix it. \n\nI\u2019d like to reliably catch these lapses. Or not lapse at all. I don\u2019t know the right mechanism. But I\u2019m guessing that tools like meditation, even GTD, are just ways to keep the higher levels of our brains engaged.
