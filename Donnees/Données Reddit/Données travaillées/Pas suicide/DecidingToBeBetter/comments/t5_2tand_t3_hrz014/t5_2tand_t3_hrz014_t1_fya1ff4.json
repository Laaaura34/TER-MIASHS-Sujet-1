I smoked heavily in college and quit for several years and it was a good decision for me then, as I was abusing it quite abit. In my own experience it was a way of avoiding some shit that was going on in my life. Now I smoke casually a few times a week or in the evening and enjoy it. But a break can sometimes be just what we need, or quitting altogether. It's not a competition and everyone is different.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fya1ff4/"}
