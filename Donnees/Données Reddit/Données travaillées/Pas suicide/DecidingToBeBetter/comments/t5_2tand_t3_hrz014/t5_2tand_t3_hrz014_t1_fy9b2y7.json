When I started running, I had so much anxiety about it. I have asthma, I'm out of shape, people are judging how awkward or slow or how much I'm breathing or sweating. I'd think about having 3 more miles to go and I'd almost have a panic response where my chest tightened and I couldn't breathe and I'd tell myself in my head there's no way I could make it. I'm still terrible at running and out of shape and have asthma, but now when I feel that panic rising up, I'm just able to acknowledge it, and work through just trying to get through that one breath. Just exhaling fully and calming myself, relaxing my shoulders. I can't think about how much further I have to go to get home. I just look for a streetlight or an intersection and say just keep running until that point. Then when I get there, pick another point. Thinking about too much, anything that feels insurmountable, makes it too easy to throw in the towel.
