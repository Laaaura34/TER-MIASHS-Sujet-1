Smoked all day everyday for close to about 20 years. It became so much a part of me I forgot it had adverse effects and was smoking it just to feel normal. Then something happened and I had to stop. At first it sucked. I found it hard to sleep and eat and was just generally cranky af. The first few days are the hardest, not gonna lie. But once you get past them everything gets easier. You're not physically addicted - its not possible, its a mental addiction. Your mind will trick you into thinking you need it and habit will force you into things that make you think about it.\nSounds a bit clich\u00e9, but exercise helps.
