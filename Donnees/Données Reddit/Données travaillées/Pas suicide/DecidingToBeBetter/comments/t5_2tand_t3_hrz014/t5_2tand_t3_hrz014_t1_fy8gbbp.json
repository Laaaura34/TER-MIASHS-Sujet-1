The basic take away is quitting feels like sacrifice and suffering ie never getting to drink again. The process through the book is really basic and I\u2019m really surprised that it worked but it leads you to not want to drink so it never feels like a sacrifice, you feel good knowing that you never have to drink again. Maybe give it a go and see. Also, don\u2019t feel stupid about your substance use. It all is impactful mostly because it leaves us grasping outside of our selves. Cannabis addiction is real and although very grateful to live in a pro rec state, it certainly makes it harder to quit. Good luck dude.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy8gbbp/"}
