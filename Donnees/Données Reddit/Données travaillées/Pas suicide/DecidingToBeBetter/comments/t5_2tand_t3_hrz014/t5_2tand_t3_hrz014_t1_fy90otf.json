Meditation would be my advice. it significantly helps my anxiety. I cant just sit and meditate though, I need an action to preform. I always brew a cup of loose leaf tea or french press coffee. really take the time to appreciate each step of the process. boil the water, prepare the cup/press, watch it steep and change color, watch the steam rising from the cup. that sort of thing. if you focus intently on every aspect of making the beverage it can be quite soothing.\n\nGood luck and I hope very dearly that you find something to help you relax!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy90otf/"}
