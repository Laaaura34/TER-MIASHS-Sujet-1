I\u2019m using it as coping with work and life stress. I think that\u2019s on me and I agree with others saying it\u2019s a psychological addiction, and right now I\u2019m smoking about 3 bowls as soon as I get off work until I go to sleep so there\u2019s not much more I can do without it rolling into my job and I think that\u2019s where I\u2019m realizing how much I depend on it. I value everyone\u2019s opinion and i know everyone is different and has experiences. Thank you for your taking time to comment and I will figure it out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fya5umh/"}
