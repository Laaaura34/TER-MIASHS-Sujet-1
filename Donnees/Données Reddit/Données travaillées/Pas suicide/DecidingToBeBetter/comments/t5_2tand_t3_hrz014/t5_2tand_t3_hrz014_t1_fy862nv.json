The idea of quitting can be challenging when you are dependent, and quitting itself is not walk in the park.  But quitting weed after 15 years of heavy daily use was the best decision I ever made in my life.  I\u2019m a million times happier with the person I am today and highly encourage you to aim for a few months off at least and see how you feel.  I took it day by day and set achievable goals for myself, and by day 100 I knew I\u2019d never smoke again.  Cold turkey was the only thing that worked for me, I didn\u2019t have the self control to ween effectively.
