After 2 months I cut it down to 0.33 grams, and 2 months later I was able to drop it completely with minimal side effects.\n\nI can't promise it will work for you because everyone is different, but it's how I managed to get out after spending more then a year trying to quit.\n\nIf quitting feels overwhelming I will definitely recommend getting professional help at a clinic.\nI choose to quit my job and checked myself into a clinic where you can come and spend the day and talk/socialize with professionals and others in the same situation, and was there for 6 months.\n\nAlso try and take a look at what other things in your life contributes to your addiction: Are you in a healthy relationship? Do you have any friends? Are your living space clean and orderly or a complete mess? How is your relationship with you family?\n\nI don't think I would have ever been able to quit if I hadn't re established a good relationship with my family, by moving away from all my addict friends in the city i was in and moved back to the city my family lives in, gotten out of a toxic relationship and later gotten into a much healthier relationship.\n\nI hope this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy8ms03/"}
