I just said you can get a psychological addiction to it just like anything else. Porn addiction is one example. Your body might not physically be addicted but it can ruin your life nontheless. I just gave examples of how it could look like since you said you hadn't seen any of it. That doesn't mean everyone that smokes has a problem or will have their lives ruined. It's not all black or white :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fya7ffa/"}
