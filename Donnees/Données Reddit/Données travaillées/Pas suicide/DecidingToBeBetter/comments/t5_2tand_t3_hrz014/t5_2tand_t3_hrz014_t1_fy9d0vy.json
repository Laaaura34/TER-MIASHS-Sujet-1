Saying weed addiction is no different than alcoholism or meth is ignorant.\n\nI work with a guy that smokes 6+ times a way, often at work. Hes probably one of the hardest working people I've ever worked with, has his own business on the side that does really well. I went to school with a persian dude who smoked a lot and dealt weed. He was taking Uni courses in highschool for med school and is a surgeon now, still smokes weed and posts literature and research about it regularly. \n\nCarl Sagan, Joe Rogan, Steve Jobs, Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt... theres countless celebrities and high performers who smoke or smoked regularly and could be described as \"addicted\". You cant say the same thing for heavy alcoholics or people who smoke crack and crystal meth.\n\nThere is 0 evidence suggesting cannabis harms an adult body as well. Actually it's the contrary.\n\nIf OP feels they need to quit smoking weed, then good for them and I wish them all the best. My post wasnt to discredit or disparage him, rather a response to the comment about cannabis \"destroying lives\". Its the kind of thing someone would say who hasnt actually seen lives destroyed by alcoholism or opiates. ts not for everybody and can certainly become a crutch for many people. My girlfriend doesnt like how coffee makes her feel so she doesnt drink it. But destroying lives is a stretch.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy9d0vy/"}
