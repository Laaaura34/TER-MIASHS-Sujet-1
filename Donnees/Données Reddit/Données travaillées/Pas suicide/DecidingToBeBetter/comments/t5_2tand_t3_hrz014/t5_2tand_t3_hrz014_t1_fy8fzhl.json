You are psychologically addicted which means you have the power to change how you're feeling and relying on weed. I say psychologically addicted, however, there are very real physical symptoms that go along with going sober. Feeling sick can be normal when trying to stop smoking this  is a psychosomatic response to the psychological addiction. That is what I discovered with myself. Everyone is different though. Find what works for you :) . I, myself, have struggled with this. Take as much time as you need to be ready to stop smoking.  I just recently took a couple days off and felt so much happier after I got over the hump. The first few days are the hardest. Know that if you take a tolerance break your experience with weed when you do smoke will only be better than how it has felt recently because your tolerance will not be so high. It is all about respecting a drug in order to get the most benefit out of it. I now take one month a year  minimum from smoking and am going to try to not smoke for 6 months in August. I know how difficult this can be so I am not saying its easy or you will for sure get it on the first try. I failed a couple times before learning my ways with marijuana and other drugs. Remember that you are okay no matter what your mind tries to tell you otherwise.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy8fzhl/"}
