The disorder in me eventually transferred to alcoholism and then opioid dependence. It was fucking up every facet of my life and I didn't even realize it, it blinded me. Even after I went through the detox and withdrawals from the alcohol and pills, I still obsessively smoked pot. I just had to. I still craved alcohol and pills, even after months. I couldn't fathom facing reality sober. \n\n\nFor me, I got into a recovery program and stuck to it. I chose AA, and it works for me. It focuses a lot on confronting the things that make me use drugs in the first place.  \n\n\nThere's that and a bunch of other things like it, like smart recovery. **I can't stress enough** how beneficial being around other people working on the same issue has been, it is so healing. Godspeed to you, kicking drugs will only change your life for the better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvhd7f/please_help_weed_is_killing_me/heb6qmu/"}
