I\u2019ve been smoking daily since the early 90\u2019s.   I couldn\u2019t go 3 hours without smoking.  I switched to edibles to try to save my lungs.  It helped me break the habit of smoking without major withdrawals. I gradually began to adjust to the edible high and it is much better.  Now I\u2019m down to one edible a day.  I can see myself quitting that as well soon.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvhd7f/please_help_weed_is_killing_me/hecs7k3/"}
