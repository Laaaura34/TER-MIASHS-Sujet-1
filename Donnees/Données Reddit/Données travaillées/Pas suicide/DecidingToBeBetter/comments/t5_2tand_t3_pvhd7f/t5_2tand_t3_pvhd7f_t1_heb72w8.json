Answer? \"I do don't drink in the morning, but you are welcome to enjoy yourself\"\n\nTold this story to give you an example of you placing boundaries. You are a bit young and probably care too much about what your friends think of you if you tell them you are now changing. Start there. Stick to your guns and your boundaries.\n\nTell them you won't be smoking next time. They don't like it? Then they lost an amazing friend who is working on improving themselves.\n\nOnce you take the social pressure aspect out of it, you will have a lot more discipline and drive to achieve your goal. Good luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvhd7f/please_help_weed_is_killing_me/heb72w8/"}
