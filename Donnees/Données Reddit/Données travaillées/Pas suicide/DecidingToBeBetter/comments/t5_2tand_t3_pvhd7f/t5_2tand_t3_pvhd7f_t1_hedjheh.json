Got my A.S. Degree, about to finish my B.A. degree with a 3.9 GPA, and going to grad school next year. Smoking doesn\u2019t necessarily have to hold you back.\n\nBut if you do want to quit, IMO best way is to reduce intake for about a week (just smoke before sleep maybe) then quit cold turkey. It\u2019ll be hard to sleep at first, so for the first few days it might help to have a few beers in the evening. \n\nFor the first month just try to stay occupied - get physical activity every day so you don\u2019t feel restless (I get a bit restless when taking breaks from smoking), and try to avoid situations where you\u2019d be used to smoking weed (like parties, hanging out with smoking buddies, going to bars). This part\u2019s important - the craving will be much harder to deal with if you put yourself in situations where you\u2019d normally be used to smoking. \n\nI also think it can be useful to find another way to treat yourself since you aren\u2019t smoking. For example, buy yourself something cool online, go to the movie theater, or eat out more so that you still have dopamine-releasing activities to look forward to.\n\nOn the whole though, you can do it. It\u2019s only really hard for a couple weeks. Remember weed isn\u2019t physically addicting, it\u2019s just psychologically habit forming. It really is a mind over matter situation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvhd7f/please_help_weed_is_killing_me/hedjheh/"}
