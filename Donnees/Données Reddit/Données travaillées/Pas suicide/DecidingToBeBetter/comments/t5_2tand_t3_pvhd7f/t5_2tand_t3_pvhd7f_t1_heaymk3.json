If yours is different - then be aggressive in finding your solution.\n* find the time fillers.   new hobbies, old hobbies, run and hike and lift to burn yourself out, play chess, read tough books.\n* your friends..... this one might get tough.   but stoner friends do as stoner friends do.   plenty of folk don't mind a party-toke, but lifestyle tokers are another kind of folk entirely.  Be prepared to have to transition your social life.  it's one of the first good steps for addicts and ex-cons -  get away from the crowds that got you there.  \n* /r/theXeffect .
