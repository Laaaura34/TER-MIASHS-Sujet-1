I think it was well thought out and you made the situation easy to sympathize with. We've all been at that point in our lives where we feel worthless. That's not true though. \nIt's very impressive that you're in law school. I know that's a field that takes dedication and concentration. That's something you should be very proud of. \nIt is hard to make friends sometimes but you can find some good people who will appreciate you for the way you are. Also, they won't try to change you. They will encourage you and help you change. Furthermore, they won't require it from you in order to stay you friend.\nI know changing yourself can be scary. It may even seem like it's impossible but you can do it. I'm sure you had your reservations about law school as well but you managed to push through and make it to your second year. \nOne thing that may help is to give yourself inspiration. Imagine how good it will feel to get your license and be able to drive to wherever you like. All you need is Win to boost your confidence and you'll start being more proactive. Good luck!
