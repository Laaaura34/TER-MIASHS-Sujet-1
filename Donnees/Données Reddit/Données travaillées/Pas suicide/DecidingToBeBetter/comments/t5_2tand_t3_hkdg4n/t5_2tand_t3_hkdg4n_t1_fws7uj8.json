I just have a very negative outlook on life and I just seem to lash out very badly when I am mad. Like i try to hurt the other person extremely with my words. I also hold grudges i.e the whole parent thing. I also have a very bad attitude when it comes to my mom. Like I don't know if it is because of my culture, but I supposed to respect my mom and not talk back at all. I usually talk back and get into arguments with her. I also have this intense need to be right. All my life I felt like being smart is all I have so I always try to argue that I am right. Also, I don't know if  this counts but I feel like everyone hates me ( don't know if its because my mom used to say that to me) or tries to pull away from me. I also have this habit of ignoring people's text when i feel drained or in a mood. I just don't like the way I am right now. I just want to be the sunny goofy person I used to be.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hkdg4n/i_realized_i_am_toxic/fws7uj8/"}
