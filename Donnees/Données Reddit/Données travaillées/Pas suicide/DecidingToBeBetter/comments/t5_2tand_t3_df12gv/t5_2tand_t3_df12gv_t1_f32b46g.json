Truly that is not what my post was about. Yes abusers should be held responsible for their actions but unfortunately it doesn't make anyone's life better to sit around hoping their abuser becomes better or to actively go looking for a good partner when you constantly put yourself down. (Yes not everyone does this and to those who don't this post is irrelevant to you) Thats what I meant. Have great partners and you should have great relationships, just don't settle for less hoping the person will change. Also don't rely on the person for your happiness before being happy. I truly do deal with people every day who are deeply unhappy and think relationships will change that and it may for a while but eventually the person they are dating goes through something and doesn't give them as much fulfillment and they become needy, clingy and insecure even then this is often the end of their relationships even if they never intended it that way. Yes its not everyone, people differ but it does happen and its those people I wanted to reach.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/df12gv/i_saw_a_quote_on_how_people_are/f32b46g/"}
