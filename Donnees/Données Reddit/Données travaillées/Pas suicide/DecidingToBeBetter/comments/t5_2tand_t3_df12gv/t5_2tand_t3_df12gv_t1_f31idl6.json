However, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that people with negative partners should leave their toxic relationship, and that people should seek partners who love them and treat them well. \n\nBy your logic, we should just date the hottest person, because we don\u2019t care if they\u2019re toxic or a good match for us. As long as they\u2019re hot, we depend on ourselves, so there\u2019s no change in value in seeking a kind person or a good match in interests.\n\nHonestly, where in that quote do you read \u201cyou should only be happy if you have people who make you happy\u201d it just doesn\u2019t say that dude.
