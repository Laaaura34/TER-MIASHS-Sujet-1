First at 26, associate degree in graphic design. 8 months of fulltime classes then  3 months as a trainee in an ad agency in Paris. I was working in a car factory, and I moved to ad/game programming. Then at 35, I got a Msc of Engineering in 20 months, fulltime classes. Now I work as a Solutions Architect in a large industrial company. I was single without  kids at both times. I'll probably get a Phd in 2-3 years. Invest on your human capital. The return is huge. I was a 26 yo punk in a factory, now I fly business class.\n\nAlso, good companies are favoring such profiles... In Europe, people who took that kind of path in life WILL always favor similar profiles in their hiring process. You will climb the ladder way faster than anybody else.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i6k8hc/for_those_of_you_who_went_back_to_school_at_a/g0wd91z/"}
