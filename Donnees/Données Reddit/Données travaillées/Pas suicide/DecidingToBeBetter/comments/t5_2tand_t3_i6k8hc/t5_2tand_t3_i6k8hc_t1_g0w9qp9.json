I went part time to a community college, got my associate's in Nuclear medicine technology at age 30. Worked 32 hours a week nights and weekends, did 35 hours a week for clinicals (not paid), and had 4 classes.  Zero debt.  Couple years later went for my bachelor's degree in computer science.  Was working full time, married, no kids.  Again went part time, 1 to 3 classes a semester,  year round, paid cash as I went with help of a minimal tuition reimbursement from work.  My last semester I had to quit work due to the classes were only offered during the day.  Graduated with only 1 semester of debt.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i6k8hc/for_those_of_you_who_went_back_to_school_at_a/g0w9qp9/"}
