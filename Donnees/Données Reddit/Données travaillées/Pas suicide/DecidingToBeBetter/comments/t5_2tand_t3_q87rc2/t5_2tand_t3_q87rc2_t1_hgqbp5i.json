For example: if you want to get healthier, instead of setting the goal of \"I want to run a 5k\", tell yourself \"I want to become a runner.\" I find these better for me because it keeps me working at the goal, and you can join them with smaller achievable goals to actually check things off. Best of luck on your growth journey!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q87rc2/im_15_and_deciding_to_take_things_in_my_own_hands/hgqbp5i/"}
