I remember the sheer misery of this type of existence and it's really crap that you have to go through it.\n\nI want to say that you are not doomed to feel like this forever. I know it feels like you are, but you are not. It does get better even though that saying often sounds like bull. I can't tell you how much better I feel these days - it is possible.\n\nBut honestly, sometimes a bit of help is powerful. I'd recommend picking up the phone to text or call one of the services at: https://www.time-to-change.org.uk/mental-health-and-stigma/help-and-support\n\nThe good thing about reaching out to a helpline is there's no committment, so it takes some of the pressure off the act of reaching out. (Talking to family can feel really pressuring because it can feel like a point-of-no-return thing. With the phone line, you can just hang up if worst comes to worst and your life is the same.) The first step is just seeing what they say. Just tell them what you told us in your post and they'll have some advice.\n\nI'm not a professional, but pretty confident what you're describing is a moderate to severe mental illness. And there are really effective ways of dealing with mental illness, so I'd say let's get you started on that journey asap :) \n\nWhatever you decide, know that you're not alone, there's nothing \"wrong\" with you as a person, you might just need some help to get you back to a better place. Good luck friend.\n\nEdit: grammar", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nx4d7g/been_feeling_like_shit_for_7_years/h1d7t9o/"}
