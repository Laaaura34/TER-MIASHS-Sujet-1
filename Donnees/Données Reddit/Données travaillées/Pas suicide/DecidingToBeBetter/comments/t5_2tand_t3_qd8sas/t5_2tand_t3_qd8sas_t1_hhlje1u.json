I stopped blaming myself and go at it one day at a time. There are still days where I fail, but I just forgive myself and try the next day. Overall I noticed I'm at work when it counts and I do all my work, which made me less scared about missing up a day, which made going to work easier.\n\nI also was thinking it was something distracting me at the beginning, but it is just me trying to escape. Tried to stop games, tv, forcing me out, etc. At the end what worked for me is going at it one day at a time. Like if you don't go for a day, then enjoy the day, and if you are not going to enjoy it then go to work. Stop the in-between.\n\nIt is a constant struggle but it becomes easier. And no need to push yourself, treat yourself like you would treat a friend who is having problems going to work. I would give him time to recover, make sure he is right, and encourage him to go to work, but not push too hard.\n\nI can't help with the lies, talk to your therapist about that. It can make you isolated and guilty. Try to not tell them because they will end hurting you. I understand if you have to, but trust is difficult to repair, especially truat in yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qd8sas/why_am_i_such_a_lazy_pos_and_how_can_i_change/hhlje1u/"}
