You\u2019re not alone in this, there is a massive crises of meaning pervading our culture. External coercion is not enough to animate you, no matter how hard you will yourself. Internal motivation will. You have to find goals that you believe in, not ones imposed upon you. You have to find a way to live that makes sense to you and maximizes your talents and gives you a sense of fulfillment and meaningful responsibility. Only you can figure out what that is. Finding that is the great adventure of your life.\n\nI\u2019d highly recommend the work of Jordan Peterson. It really helped, and continues to help, me and millions of others. And it isn\u2019t about conforming to a system, it\u2019s about finding out what you intrinsically value, and moving toward that with courage. Good luck to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qd8sas/why_am_i_such_a_lazy_pos_and_how_can_i_change/hhm2p5t/"}
