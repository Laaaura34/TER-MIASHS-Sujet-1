You change by not being lazy. The answer is already in your question if you think about it\n\nTake over some chores in the house and show appreciation that way, cook some dinners, learn to be independent, find a job you like, volunteer, make new friends, invest more time into your hobby, spend time with family,  learn a new language\u2026.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot you can do with your time, as you\u2019ve read.\n\nIf you want to develop a new version of yourself, learn from what you got. Your parents who are hard workers. They have it in them, you have it in yourself somewhere, you just have to ignite that flame and thrive. \n\nTo me, it seems like could be depressed. In no way am I a doctor, but what you\u2019re describing in this post almost seems like you\u2019re underlying depressed. \n\nI can understand why because of what you\u2019ve written. You feel lazy.

Their situation is not the same as yours. Work with what you have and figure out the rest.\u201d\n\n\nYou will figure this out. Ignite that flame! You have it in you, you just have to start somewhere. The first step is believing in yourself. The next step is executing it. \n\nYou can do it!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qd8sas/why_am_i_such_a_lazy_pos_and_how_can_i_change/hhme25b/"}
