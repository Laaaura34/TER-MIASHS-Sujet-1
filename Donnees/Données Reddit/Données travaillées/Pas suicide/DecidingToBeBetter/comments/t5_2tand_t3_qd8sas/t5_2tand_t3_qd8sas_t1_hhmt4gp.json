If you go to work, to the gym, to read a book, to help other people, to serve others? You are not any of those nasty things you say about yourself.\n\nWe tend to think that massive change requires massive action, and that usually isn\u2019t true. It can almost always be accomplished with tiny changes done consistently. A walk instead of a TV show. Water instead of soda. Setting out your clothes for work instead of watching TV. Setting your alarm a few minutes earlier. Just do the little things to make your life one tiny bit better everyday.\n\nAnd they make your life better, and then you\u2019re in a place to do things for other people.
