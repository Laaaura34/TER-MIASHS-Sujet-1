Try not to beat yourself up. It sounds like you've overcome a lot and have put a lot of attention/felt a lot of pain to get to this realization. During the pandemic you can't very well get involved in social stuff but you can start to pursue your own interests! Start having fun with your time. Dance, create art, write something, learn to laugh again and forgive yourself for the past. When your light is shining from believing in yourself again, friends and experiences come to you. It takes compassion, courage, love, humor, and a lot of energy, but you can get back to yourself. You got this!!! Anything you can do to get your relationship with food healthy again should be top of your list. You're going to need energy and wellness for this and 25 lbs is a huge loss for anyone. Cooking can be really creative and fulfilling and it helped teach me to laugh at my mistakes and either stomach them or start over, and how to know when to do which. Make your favorite foods, indulge on butter, have pasta and sandwiches and everything you like if you can.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iaqri7/decided_to_stop_being_a_loser_todayyyy/g1r604s/"}
