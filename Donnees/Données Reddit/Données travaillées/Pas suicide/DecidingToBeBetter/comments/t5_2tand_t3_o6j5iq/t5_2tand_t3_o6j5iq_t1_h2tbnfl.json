So in a loud room, I can't understand anything, whereas others are doing perfectly fine. Visually I just have to close my eyes if eg I'm standing in front of a shelf at a store with various items\n\nI also started talking when I was 5 years old, before that it was nonsense gibberish like you'd expect from a maybe 2 year old\n\nI always had difficulties connecting with each other (and strangely enough, others were and are still today wondering why I am friends with X and Y as person X and Y are \"arrogant\")\n\nI can hardly look others in the eyes, and I can't seem to interpret what people are feeling (based on their countenance and gestures)\n\nI also have some special interests, some years ago it was building my own language and it was literally the only thing bothering me\n\nSo it is very possible. My dad knows another kid on the spectrum, and if he's writing with his father about him, his father is describing his behavior just like mine", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6j5iq/everyone_is_telling_me_that_im_an_egoist_and_not/h2tbnfl/"}
