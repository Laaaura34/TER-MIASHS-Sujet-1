As all of this and more are the realities for people right now, what a privilege it would truly be, to be able to worry about climate change at a time like this. I\u2019m sure you can understand how climate change has no room inside the lives of people whose world very well may feel like its actually ending right now, how there is no room inside the minds of the people who give their emotional, mental, and physical energy trying help, daily. Again, what a privilege it would be to have climate change as the biggest concern in your mind right now. What a privilege it would be, to be that out of touch with reality.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fs49zi/corona_makes_us_forget_the_biggest_issue_of_our/flzulg9/"}
