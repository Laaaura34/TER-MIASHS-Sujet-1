I know a lot of people who train in combat sports. You are probably too late for the very top level competition, but not at all too late to get into the ring or cage. You can train before and after your regular job. When you build up some skill, you can be an instructor if you have that kind of motivation. Lots of people come into it with a ton of ambition. Part of what sets the competitors apart is that they keep at it. Work though being a beginner, getting smoked in sparring sessions, holding pads for more experienced people, getting up at the crack of dawn for two a day training and a 9 to 5. \n\n  No way is it too late, but you have to stay realistic about where you are and what the next step is. It isn\u2019t Connor McGregor, it\u2019s Steve at the local gym who might be 17 years old, and he\u2019s gonna beat you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qe2kcg/passion_or_bullshit/hhs350u/"}
