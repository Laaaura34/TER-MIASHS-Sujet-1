I know that r/Depression is a better place to do that but it\u2019s also not the most positive place, so I decided to post here.\n\nI have a month till my next appointment with my psych; however the truth is most antidepressants, and I know this from both experience and research, cause at least some nausea when you just started them. Which is really ironic; the most anxiety causing thing for me is nausea, and the most common side effect of nearly all antidepressants, drugs that are meant to stop anxiety, is also nausea, which gives me a lot of anxiety!\n\nMirtazapine in this regard is exceptional; it\u2019s not just nausea free, it actually helps nausea. However after almost three years on it, it\u2019s no longer effective enough for me. There is also bupropion but it gave me horrible stomach cramps.\n\nTherefore I won\u2019t go for an early appointment. There is nothing else on the market that they can give to me. Not because I have a physical problem that prohibits me from taking antidepressants, but because nearly all of them cause nausea, and that I just can\u2019t tolerate for some reason.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nrmgoh/it_feels_like_i_have_failed_again/h0k4q3c/"}
