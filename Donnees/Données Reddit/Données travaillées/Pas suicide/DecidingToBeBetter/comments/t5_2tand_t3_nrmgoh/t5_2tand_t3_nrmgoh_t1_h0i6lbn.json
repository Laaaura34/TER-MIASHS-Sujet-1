They need to know how you are taking things and why. You need to talk to them about what is going on in your head. Because this is a new medication for you I don\u2019t want to give you any advice about this one. \n\nThat said I am super, super proud of you. Take a hug from a stranger and know that we are all, at any time, just trying to do our best. Our struggles are 99% hidden from others, and that can lead to feeling alone. But you are not, and you are working toward something great, so get a hold of your doctor and make some progress through this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nrmgoh/it_feels_like_i_have_failed_again/h0i6lbn/"}
