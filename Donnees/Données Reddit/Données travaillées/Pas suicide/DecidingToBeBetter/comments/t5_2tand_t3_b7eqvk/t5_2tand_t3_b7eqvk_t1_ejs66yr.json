Shaking that mindset in favor of one that says \"a little is better than nothing\" has been life changing. Now I do some squats while I brush my teeth, or practice piano for even 10 minutes, or read for 10 minutes (or whatever it is) is LITERALLY BETTER THAN NOTHING. And what I've found is that I have more energy to do 10 minutes spurts of things, and when I feel like going longer, I do. \n\nThe other thing I do is talk to my future self. When I think of something like doing laundry, a task I don't want to complete right now, I think of me tomorrow. Is she REALLY going to want to do it either? Fuck no. So do tomorrow me a favor and just get it done. Then I say things like, \"Hey, thanks past me for  doing the laundry/setting the coffee timer so I could wake up to fresh brewed coffee.\"\n\nI hope that's helpful, these two things have been the most impactful for me!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b7eqvk/i_feel_like_my_life_is_a_constant_struggle_to_not/ejs66yr/"}
