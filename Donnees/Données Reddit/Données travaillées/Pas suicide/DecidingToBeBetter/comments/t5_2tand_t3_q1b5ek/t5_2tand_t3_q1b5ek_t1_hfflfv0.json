A lot of times we slip into depression because we are so hard on ourselves, we speak so ill or feel so ill about ourselves that we become our own worst enemy. So stop being so hard on yourself as well as set little goals that you can feel good about after you conquer them. Enjoy yourself take a min to look back on the accomplishments you mentioned in college classes and clubs I don't think you would be in any of those if you weren't passionate about them. Changing your perspective and how you view the big and small things can really help. Hope this helps you're doing great keep your head up the only way to go is up from here.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1b5ek/i_want_to_stop_falling_into_depressive_slumps_and/hfflfv0/"}
