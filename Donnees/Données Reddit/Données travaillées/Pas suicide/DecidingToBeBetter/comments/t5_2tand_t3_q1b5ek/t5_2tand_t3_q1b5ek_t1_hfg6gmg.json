The first thing is be compassionate with yourself, I already saw that in a few comments. Does something set off your depressive moods? Can you pinpoint an event or feeling? This is where a therapist is very helpful, to help you rethink things that happen in life. If you can't find a therapy spot, you can look into books and guided journals, they are a good start.\n\nBut for something more practical and immediate, make a little self care kit. Put some quick meals in there (Ramen maybe? Microwave meal? Pop tarts?), some snacks or chocolate, get yourself some bath or shower bombs, some mouth wash, baby wipes. Write down some people you trust and can reach out to. And first and foremost just take care of yourself on those days. Be kind to yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1b5ek/i_want_to_stop_falling_into_depressive_slumps_and/hfg6gmg/"}
