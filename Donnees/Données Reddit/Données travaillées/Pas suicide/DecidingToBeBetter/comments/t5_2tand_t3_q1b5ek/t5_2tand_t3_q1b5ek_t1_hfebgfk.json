Are you taking care of yourself physically through diet and exercise mainly?  Are you practicing mindfulness to moderate the thoughts that constantly come?\n\nThe mindfulness one is especially important because in our society, we're suggested to care for ourselves externally and are never taught how to do it internally.  The stigma attached to mental health is a perfect example of this sort of status quo.  Then you hear about people who are at a later stage in life or at the end of the road and are so unfulfilled, well, it's no wonder since they don't even know who they are internally having lived so externally.\n\nSelf-discovery is extremely critical.  Like Pablo Picasso said, \"The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.\"  Without maximal alignment to your gifts, you will struggle and not find fulfillment in life.\n\nHope this helps you!  PS.
