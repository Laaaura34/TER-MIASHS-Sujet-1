For example, I may need to do the washing up or put the laundry away; so I think if I do that then afterwards I can do something I will enjoy (playing video games, colouring etc) or that is good for me (a shower or bath, or even going to bed). Also putting on the radio and having something to keep your mind from wandering too much is good and helps the the time go a bit faster. Keep reminding yourself you'll feel much better after getting something done, just one thing if that's all you can handle.
