Orrr on the way to college tell yourself you\u2019re going to stop and get a really nice coffee. \nI fight depression myself and have to set myself little goals every day, some days my only goals are tiny one room in my house or go for a walk and other days I feel like I can conquer the world. \nI also think try to find a podcast you enjoy, then you can get some tasks done like getting dressed, tiny your room, walk to college etc a d you\u2019ll be entertained a d it won\u2019t be as bad as you thought. Best of luck, you\u2019re already doing great by even writing this post and seeking ways to improve yourself", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1b5ek/i_want_to_stop_falling_into_depressive_slumps_and/hfe7zfj/"}
