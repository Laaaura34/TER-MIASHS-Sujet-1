I think modern medicine and society has made the mistake of treating it as a mind and brain thing, when you don\u2019t think yourself into sleeping for 12 hours.\n\nCommon root causes of depression you can easily try to change until you find your problem\n- allergies (gluten, dairy, pollen)\n- diet (processed foods)\n- medication (birth control, ADHD meds, etc)\n- activity (exercise)\n- sun exposure\n- nutrients (multivitamins, electrolytes)\n\nSeriously, I was depressed for a long time.
