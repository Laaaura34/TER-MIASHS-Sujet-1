That\u2019s all, just get up. Sometimes I will sit on the edge of the bed for a few minutes until I am able to get to the next step which is either to take off my days old clothes, or open my window for some fresh air.\n\nHaving dealt with this shit for years, I know that if I can get myself to that damn shower and scrub off the bullshit of the few days where I let it take me, I am moving forward. Honest.\n\nEven if I put on clean jammies and go back to bed, I have taken a step forward which is to take care of my hygiene, and you know that is a big deal.\n\nI think of the scenario in the same vein as when I had a monumental physical task ahead of me.
