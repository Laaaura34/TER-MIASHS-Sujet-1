In that case you want to make sure that you have a sufficient supply of vitamin D and also magnesium. Those two things can affect your depression. Exercise is great and helps to keep the depression under control. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything crazy like a marathon but just a walk around the block or maybe yoga. And you\u2019re right you can\u2019t just get up and go. People who have never had depression do not understand depression. It\u2019s not just being sad. Depression zaps you of all energy and causes you not to care about anything and it makes you so tired. I would try taking vitamin D and magnesium and being out in the sunshine and taking a walk. But if those things don\u2019t work you may want to consider talking to your doctor about some thing that can help you to control it every day. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1b5ek/i_want_to_stop_falling_into_depressive_slumps_and/hfe52uk/"}
