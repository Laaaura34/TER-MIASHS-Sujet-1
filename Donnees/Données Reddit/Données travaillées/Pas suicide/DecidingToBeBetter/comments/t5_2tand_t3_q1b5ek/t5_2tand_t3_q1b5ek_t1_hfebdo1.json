The only way to stay on top is preemptive behavior.  Even then, some people can't cope without meds. Start learning healthy habits now,  life usually gets more stressful with age. The only thing you have control of is your coping skills.\n\nSleep, diet, exercise and pursuing goals that give your life meaning should be first priority.\n\nYour school might have free counseling services, take advantage. \n\nPersonally,  i don't have easy access to medical services. I usually only get depressed on my off days when i don't have any work to do so my advice is to keep busy. On days I can't \"do\" anything, i usually force myself to go for a drive or visit a place/ restaurant I've never been to and that snaps me out of it, at least for the rest of the day. Like another post said, go out and treat yourself to a latte, or meal.\n\nHabits/things that have helped me: writing in a journal, fun hobbies, exercising 4 days a week, sleeping when i'm tired, tracking my sleep, exercise, and food, making excel sheets for my work / housework, making lists of my goals, strengths, and weaknesses, walking more, cleaning and organizing everyday, practicing self control with food, games, tv. , reading self help books, reading and learning in general, planning outing with friends. Good luck and feel free to DM me on any more details.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1b5ek/i_want_to_stop_falling_into_depressive_slumps_and/hfebdo1/"}
