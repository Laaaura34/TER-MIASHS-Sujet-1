No doubt about that AT ALL. But I think how I pulled off today\u2019s 10K was purely from running everyday single day except for one day out of the week where I rest. I run everyday and three days out of the week, I run twice; in the morning for 2KM followed by a 1KM walk and I repeat in the evening. The other three days in the week I run once in the evening as I go the gym in the morning. And I spend either Saturday or Sunday totally exercise-free. I\u2019ve been repeating this routine since August last year and it\u2019s done me wonders. Prior to running, I actually started out with trekking, there\u2019s an easy 3KM trail near my house. I went everyday in august - September and then afterwards I began running around my neighbourhood. Slow runs and built my way up to where I am now!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lis9uk/i_ran_10km_this_morning_for_the_first_time_in_my/gn5wlm5/"}
