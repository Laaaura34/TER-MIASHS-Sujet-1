Ate clean. No junk food/fast food at all. I didn\u2019t follow a specific diet. I explained my running routine somewhere in the comments that you can look at! And At the beginning of my diet, I gave myself a single cheat day every four weeks (which is drastic and I don\u2019t recommend it) and then it became  a cheat day every two weeks. But now since I\u2019m at my target weight, I\u2019m a bit more relaxed with my diet. Portion control and everything in moderation. But I still don\u2019t do fast food unless it\u2019s On a cheat day :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lis9uk/i_ran_10km_this_morning_for_the_first_time_in_my/gncsbgg/"}
