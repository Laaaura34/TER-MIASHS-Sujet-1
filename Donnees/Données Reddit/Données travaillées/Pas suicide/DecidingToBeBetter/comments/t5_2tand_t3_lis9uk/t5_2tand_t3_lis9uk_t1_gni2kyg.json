My advice would be to pace yourself but at the same time try your best not to give in completely. You may be unmotivated and or undetermined but I promise that you will not regret doing it afterwards. You feel so much better about yourself. Endorphins are powerful things. 31 days I believe is a good numbers of days! Don\u2019t give up! You\u2019re doing so well and I\u2019m so damned proud of you!! And remember that it\u2019s okay to stumble! Just pick yourself up again! I\u2019m wishing you all the best, my friend :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lis9uk/i_ran_10km_this_morning_for_the_first_time_in_my/gni2kyg/"}
