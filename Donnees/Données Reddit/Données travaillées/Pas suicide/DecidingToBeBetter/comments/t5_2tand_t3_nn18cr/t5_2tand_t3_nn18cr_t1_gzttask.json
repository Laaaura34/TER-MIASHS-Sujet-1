But I hope you all take credit for helping yourself. When doctors remove cancer, thanking god is the last thing you want to do, he put the tumor there! If you pulled yourself out of a bad stop, YOU did it. Not by the grace of god, but by your determination, your dedication. \n\nDecide to be better, thank yourself once in awhile for what you're doing right and what's good in life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nn18cr/depression_is_not_life/gzttask/"}
