Positivity is contagious if it\u2019s coming from the person who loves, protects, and cares for you, so keep it up! \n\nWhile I was young she would apologize for my childhood but I told her that I have learned how \u201cnot\u201d to be from the partners she had. By that I mean: from my dad, I know how not to be a Father. From my step dad, I know how not to be a husband. I am thankful for that. I think these difficult situations kids are put in are beneficial if you have a role model (like yourself) with a positive attitude that can help you through the tough times. Again, thank you for being you. Sending you all the positive vibes and love!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p3pyca/one_year_from_now_i_wont_have_most_problems_i/h8t94v8/"}
