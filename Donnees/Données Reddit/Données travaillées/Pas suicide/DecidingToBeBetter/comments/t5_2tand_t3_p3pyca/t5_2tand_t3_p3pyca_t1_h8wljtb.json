It sounds like you've got involved in several less-than-ideal situations, and you've known to - and *how* to - find your way out of them. As well as knowing to use the possessive with a gerund (\"resulted in my fianc\u00e9's becoming\"), so props for that, haha. If you've navigated all of these issues, you've got shit under control, and I don't doubt you're on a path to great things. \n\nIf I have one tip, it's to find a purpose for your life beyond relationships. Things work much better if relationships are a side show, something that's just assumed and there for support, rather than the main entertainment. Besides that, I think you know more than most of us do about life, so I don't really have any advice to give you :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p3pyca/one_year_from_now_i_wont_have_most_problems_i/h8wljtb/"}
