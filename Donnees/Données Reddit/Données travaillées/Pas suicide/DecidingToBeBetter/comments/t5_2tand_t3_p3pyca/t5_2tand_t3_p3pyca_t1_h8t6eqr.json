I was in your child\u2019s shoes, and I have to say your effort is most definitely seen and appreciated. I remember my mom not having much at all while I was growing up, but she would do her best and that\u2019s all anyone can ask for. \n\nShe divorced my dad when I was 10 or so, he was a raging alcoholic. She got remarried 3 years later to a very manipulative and abusive asshole. Then 7 years later she met and married a man who is just amazing. I would say that people like you persevere for those you love, like your daughter. I thank you for being a great parent despite the difficult situation you\u2019ve been put into. Keep your positive mindset and that will rub off on your little one. Wishing you all the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p3pyca/one_year_from_now_i_wont_have_most_problems_i/h8t6eqr/"}
