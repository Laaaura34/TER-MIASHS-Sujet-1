Maybe it's time to geek out.\n\nMaybe nighttime glow in the dark kayaking is an excuse to do some great stargazing (no light pollution!). Or maybe your forest walk is because you're looking to get into some landscape photography (which you can do with just the camera in your phone). \n\nMaybe you're just keeping a journal of all these experiences so you can write a book some day. Regardless, if you find a reason for yourself, I think you'll worry a lot less about everyone else.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of1van/sucking_it_up_and_dating_myself/h4afqs6/"}
