I've got the journals, my film camera, and just my presence and awareness alone as reasons enough to pursue these sorts of things. I'm the type of guy who drove down to the lake last night at 1am to smoke a joint by the water and stare at a distant lightning storm and try to capture some strikes on video in slow mo. Pretty much all of me is rudderless barefoot contessa mode; there's just this malingering insecurity/self doubt that seems to be rearing up in power as it sees just how well I am becoming at enjoying myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of1van/sucking_it_up_and_dating_myself/h4agrtl/"}
