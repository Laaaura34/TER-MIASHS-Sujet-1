It\u2019s almost like directing a fan to a fire. A small fire will be blown out fairly quickly with a powerful enough fan. A larger fire will just be encouraged and spread. I\u2019ve heard it being referred to as toxic positivity. Blowing positivity onto the fire of depression, could just mask the underlying causes and put more pressure on yourself to feel better, and thus making it worse. \n\nI recently listened to a great podcast called Happiness lab and they discussed the pain of rejection and how it light up the same parts of the brain as physical pain does. My take is this, We evolved to be part of a small community who love and support us, if we don\u2019t feel like, we belong to a community that love and support us it causes us actual pain. I think that if we don\u2019t feel supported, loved, or a part of our family, friends, society it triggers a feeling of rejection which then creates classic depression symptoms (heartaches, numb and or sore muscles, headaches etc). Of course some people are unfortunate in the generic lottery and have a chemical/brain imbalance, and needs meds and other forms of support. \n\nAnyway I\u2019m not a professional, but it has helped me to think in these terms. Who\u2019s your tribe, do you feel like they support and love you and you play an important role in their lives. Or do you feel \u2018rejected\u2019 by your family, friends or society? The feeling of rejection could be  as simple as you had a bad experience and those around you told you to get over it and or blamed you, or said just be positive, stop being so down about it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjquy2/overcoming_depression_we_are_who_we_choose_to_be/hbysvl5/"}
