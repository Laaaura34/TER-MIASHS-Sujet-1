I'm still battling my own storms but I am doing my best getting the help I need. We really are who we choose to be. Sometimes in order to rise we must fall. The hardest lessons sometimes hurt the worst but it's enough to motivate us. While acting does get so far in the career field, it can only carry us so far outside of jobs. However, it's that motivation, that drive, that strength to fight this depression. I failed to get the help I long needed before but I'm finally on the right track to becoming who I really want to be. I too am not okay with the things I've done but I can't let the mistakes judge me forever. What I would do to have your age again and fix the issues I had for so long. Never feel like you must belong with people, rather follow your heart. Follow yourself and never become \"The Perfect Person\", you would only feel the world on your shoulders, eternally suffering. Don't torture yourself nor be blinded by pain like I have. Enjoy the moments you share with the people you care about and live a happy life for yourself and whomever you wish to share it. Never spread your pain onto people or bottle the pain inside. Instead bury the pain and let go of pressure. Be yourself and you will be happy, just don't bring anyone down with you.
