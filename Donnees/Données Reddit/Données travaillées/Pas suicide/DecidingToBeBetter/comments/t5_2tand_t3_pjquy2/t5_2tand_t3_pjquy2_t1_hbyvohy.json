I have grown much more as a person in my mid-20s than I did as a teenager. I have more freedom, more money, more free time. I'm cognitively more mature and can understand things (whether it be works of art or books) that I could not understand before.\n\nI think our society fetishizes youth. Almost every movie/TV show/etc has a protagonist under 25. It's unnecessary. There's such a beauty to the maturity that comes with age, one I personally am beginning to value more than the naivete of youth.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjquy2/overcoming_depression_we_are_who_we_choose_to_be/hbyvohy/"}
