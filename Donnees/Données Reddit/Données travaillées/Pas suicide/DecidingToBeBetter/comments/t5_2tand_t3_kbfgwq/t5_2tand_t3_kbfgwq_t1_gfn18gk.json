Just retain your semen for 2 years and women will come out of the wood work to try to fuck you. Literally as easy as this because nobody in their right mind has high enough power level to stop touching their dicks for years. But once you do it you understand how powerful it is. \n\nYou are there reaching epic level of concentration and commitment. Meanwhile losers over there fapping themselves once a day and contently having no drive.\n\nAnd once women try to get you just refuse them out of principle.\n\nWhere were women back when you were 16 and lonely?\n\nNow that you are 30, made your place in life, became rugged and handsome suddenly they all want your seed.\n\nSomething is wrong with you and it is not virginity, it is the fact that you are not 100 % content with yourself and you want to emulate dumb monkeys fucking women over there.\n\nSure women are fantastic and nice and good but they are not worth losing your man essence over, maybe to conceive but just for fun it sounds pretty dumb.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbfgwq/i_was_a_30_year_old_virgin_and_thought_i_would_be/gfn18gk/"}
