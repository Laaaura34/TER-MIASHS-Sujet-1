You say you're undateable but the facts speak for themselves: she's dating you. Remind yourself of this. She's spotted something in you that you haven't acknowledged in yourself. \n\nWanting that \"spark\" on a first date is a sure fire way to be disappointed though. I didn't experience the love at first sight thing and don't know anybody that has. It will take a few dates to get there but i found activity dates (ice skating, bowling etc) are good for reducing some of the 1:1 tension.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbfgwq/i_was_a_30_year_old_virgin_and_thought_i_would_be/gfku09z/"}
