I feel like everyone is saying my feelings aren't valid. I usually maintain a pretty positive attitude about the whole situation, but to say there's nothing wrong is like saying I'm not allowed to feel what I feel. Like it's all in my head. Like society and culture have nothing to do with it. I was raised by very conservative Asian parents. That has a lot to do with it. I'm always afraid of disappointing them. I'm always afraid of pursuing what I want. Like it's selfish to get what I want.\n\nI just started feeling really down about this just now and I'm glad I logged on and saw your message of support. Thank you. You don't know what that means to me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbfgwq/i_was_a_30_year_old_virgin_and_thought_i_would_be/gfm6hyv/"}
