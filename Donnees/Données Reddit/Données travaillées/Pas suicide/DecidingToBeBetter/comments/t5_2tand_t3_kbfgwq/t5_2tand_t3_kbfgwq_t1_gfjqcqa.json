I definitely hear you. I get strange looks when i tell people we met on Tinder. I tried so many others: plenty of fish, match, eharmony, shaadi, okcupid and probably many more. I couldn't even get a response on other sites. The less is more approach of a Tinder profile suited me but you're right it was a shallow and horrible experience at times. I also think it's much worse now than when I was on it. I guess it may also depend on region as I personally know many couples who met on Tinder.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbfgwq/i_was_a_30_year_old_virgin_and_thought_i_would_be/gfjqcqa/"}
