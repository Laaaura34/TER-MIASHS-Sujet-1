I know those feelings myself. You (and I) *are* missing out on a basic human experience. I might even say you are a failure, at least in the strictly factual sense that you have indeed failed at procuring a partner thus far. But that last part? You may or may not have done something wrong. It's so hard to say, even when we're mulling over ourselves let alone strangers on the Internet. Obviously you don't know what you're doing wrong or you would've fixed the problem by now, but since feelings aren't rational and everyone responds differently to the same stimulus, it's all but impossible to nail down a specific reason(s) for our failures. And there's so many variables beyond our own control that it's not unlikely we're doing nothing wrong but merely unlucky!\n\nThat said, there's nothing wrong with the actual state of being a virgin, at any age, by which I mean someone having sex or not doesn't determine if they're competent at their job or a good person. The problem is the perception others have upon discovering it. Average people lose their virginities in their teens and the vast majority by their mid-20's, so people naturally have concerns about the outliers who haven't. Why not? You might be one of those \"unlucky\" folks, but odds are there's something \"wrong\" with you that's driving away all potential suitors and most people aren't going to waste their time giving you a chance to prove otherwise.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbfgwq/i_was_a_30_year_old_virgin_and_thought_i_would_be/gfocwo1/"}
