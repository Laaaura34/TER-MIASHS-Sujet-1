Only eternal void and eternal peace.\n\nThat there is no women that selected you to mate either means you have not retained your semen enough or your sexual market value is too low.\n\nBut what is this, sexual market value, mating, women? \n\nThis is low value, something animals preoccupy themselves with.\n\nIf you are a human being the spiritual journey is much more satisfying and has lower barrier of entry. \n\nYou do not have to be a six foot chad to get started. Take sexuality, seal it completely for 2 years and see where it takes you. Clearly you do not need it if all you (and me btw) ever used it for was to cum in a fleshlight, what a waste of man essence that could be used to construct the ultimate apex male AKA you instead of nourishing a fleshlight.\n\nTruly life changing in every way this spiritual journey is.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbfgwq/i_was_a_30_year_old_virgin_and_thought_i_would_be/gfn2j0q/"}
