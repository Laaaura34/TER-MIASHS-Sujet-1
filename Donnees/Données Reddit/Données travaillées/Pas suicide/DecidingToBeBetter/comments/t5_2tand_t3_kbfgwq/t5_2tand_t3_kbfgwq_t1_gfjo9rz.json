I struggled with mental health too in a job where i was getting yelled at by my boss everyday. The tipping point was when i went on leave for a week and felt  such an enormous but short lived relief and the tightness in my chest just went away momentarily. The sinking feeling at having to go back told me I was in the wrong place. I wish you all the best if you do switch careers. You're absolutely right, as long as you still make enough to get by the salary downgrade is totally worth it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbfgwq/i_was_a_30_year_old_virgin_and_thought_i_would_be/gfjo9rz/"}
