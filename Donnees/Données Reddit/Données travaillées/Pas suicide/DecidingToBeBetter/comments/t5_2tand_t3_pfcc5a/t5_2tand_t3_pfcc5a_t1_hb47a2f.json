It sounds like a bit of co-dependency is happening here and I have it as well. You need to find your own identity, hobbies, friends, etc... If you're not truly happy with yourself or being alone then this will haunt you and hurt future relationships. I would recommend going to talk to a professional which helped me significantly or do some serious soul searching as to what makes YOU happy. We all need alone time and a significant other should never complete you but when you two are together it's a big added bonus. Take care of your physical/ mental health, start exercising, take a hobby like golf, fishing, hiking, etc... Reconnect with old friends or make new ones with common interests that you have. To feel jealous over your GF having her alone time or chatting with friends is not healthy, once you find love within yourself, most of your fears will diminish, hope this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfcc5a/not_sure_what_my_problem_is_but_i_want_to_move/hb47a2f/"}
