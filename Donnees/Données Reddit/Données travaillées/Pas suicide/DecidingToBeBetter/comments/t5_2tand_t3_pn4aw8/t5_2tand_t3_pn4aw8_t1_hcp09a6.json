I am already trying to cut down when I can! So basically as soon as I start getting tired, I get in bed. I haven\u2019t been getting drunk most nights by any means, just usually enough to make me tired earlier in the night, so that\u2019s around the level I want to keep until I get meds. But again, I\u2019m cutting down where I can, and I\u2019m going to keep trying on weekends to sleep without drinking :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pn4aw8/at_the_end_of_the_month_im_going_to_cut_back_on/hcp09a6/"}
