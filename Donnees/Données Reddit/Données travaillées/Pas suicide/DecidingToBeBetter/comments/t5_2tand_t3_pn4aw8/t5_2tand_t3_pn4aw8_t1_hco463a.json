I really hope it goes well.\n\nSmall suggestion: why not capitalise on some of the motivation you currently have and start cutting down now? By a small enough amount that it won't affect your sleep, but will still provide the psychological boost and confidence in knowing that you're making progress, no matter how small. Let's say you drink a few beers each night for example. Go ahead and drink as normal, but tip away a little on that first beer (or some other gentle reduction and attainable target) for the next week. After a week or two maybe cut it down further, see how you feel. Come the end of the month, even if you do decide cut down by a much more significant amount, you'll be in a slightly better position and you'll have more confidence in knowing that you can achieve this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pn4aw8/at_the_end_of_the_month_im_going_to_cut_back_on/hco463a/"}
