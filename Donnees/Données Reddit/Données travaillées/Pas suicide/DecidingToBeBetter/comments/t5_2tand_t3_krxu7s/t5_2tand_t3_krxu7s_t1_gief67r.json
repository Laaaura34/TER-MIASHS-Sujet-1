Unlearning bad habits is very difficult. Starting with good habits is much easier. You will hit a block down the road otherwise. I speak from experience\n\nAlso be absolutely sure you follow the fingering specified in pieces. And learn some scales because  playing them teaches you how to comfortably use the thumb without contorting your hand\n\nKeep wrists level, don\u2019t let elbows kick out or your hand twist left and right. Watch some trained intermediate players and study their body posture and hand positioning\n\nLove Debussy. Try Jimbo\u2019s Lullaby. He invented the whole tone scale. That\u2019s what goves his music its distinctive sound. You\u2019ll hear it in that piece", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/krxu7s/i_started_learning_to_play_the_piano_earlier_this/gief67r/"}
