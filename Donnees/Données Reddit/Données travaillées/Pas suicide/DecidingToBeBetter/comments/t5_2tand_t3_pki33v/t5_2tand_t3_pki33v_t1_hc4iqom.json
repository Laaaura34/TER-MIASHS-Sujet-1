While the intention is noble, unintentionally we are sending the message that the desired behaviour isn't to shine brightly, but to dim ourselves for others. By allowing yourself to shine as bright as you want, leading by example, you show the people around you that it is in fact, very much allowed and desired to shine as bright as we can, so we can illuminate the world together  :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pki33v/im_giving_up_making_myself_mediocre_to_make/hc4iqom/"}
