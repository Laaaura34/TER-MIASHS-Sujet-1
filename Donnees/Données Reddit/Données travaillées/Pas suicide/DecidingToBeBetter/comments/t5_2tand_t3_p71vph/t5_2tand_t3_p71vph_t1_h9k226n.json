That is your future....\n\nYour Mom and Dad Love you and want what is best for you. But this is where you should take a stand for yourself. Your life is your life, not theirs. However, honor their Love an concern for you. You can say: Mom, Dad I know you want what is best for me, but this is my life and I need to learn to live it on my terms.  This is what I need to do. If I don't succeed, I will come to you, but this is what I have to try....\n\nI just created a video on fulfillment. Watch it.  It is all about it: [https://youtu.be/obNb9bu6IFw](https://youtu.be/obNb9bu6IFw)\n\nI just retired and am dedicating my life to supporting people in their growth and development. There is way too much unnecessary suffering out there due to people doing what they can make money with vs. people following their passion from early on in life.\n\nTake a stand for your passion. Don't just do it because you are good at it. I am good at cleaning toilets, but it doesn't fulfill me. Coaching, teaching and empowering people does... Do what fulfills you.\n\nGood luck.  Will you let me know how it goes?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p71vph/my_20s_were_challenging_also_you_will_work/h9k226n/"}
