My therapist actually recommended it. I have a lot of empathy and am sensitive, which I didn\u2019t even realize were skills because my parents always viewed emotions as roadblocks to success.  I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m \u201cfree therapy\u201d from my friends, and I always want to be someone people talk to. I am looking into a masters program now for it. I\u2019m in a PhD for chemistry, and I barely go into the lab anymore because I feel so downtrodden by it. It\u2019s just a transition in my mind to go from STEM (which my parents always pushed, although when I told them I was going to get a PhD my mom cried since it was failure for them\u2026.) to mental health. But I believe I can make more impact as a counselor or therapist than I can ever make as a researcher", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p71vph/my_20s_were_challenging_also_you_will_work/h9judqj/"}
