The major differences I have made is: not putting fulfillment into school, finding small hobbies and tasks that aren\u2019t productive but make me feel good (coloring, reading, walking, baking), and adopting an exercise routine I like. I\u2019m working through with a therapist to realize why my childhood made me the way I am, which is real hard since most of my memory is wiped clean (from drugs? Trauma? Who knows). I cry all the time and very easily. \n\nI still feel so lost. I have no idea what I want to do with my career. My parents raised me on nothing but hard work towards a big paycheck. When covid happened and I couldn\u2019t work, I didn\u2019t even know how to live. And then I realized what I was doing WASNT living, and it wasn\u2019t wrong of me to want more out of life. I had to rebuild myself from the ground up, literally, of how to be a balanced person. And now I can\u2019t stand going back to work. I feel I have no passion, and what I do have passion for, it\u2019s out of my reach. I have lost all motivation to work, and it is really killing my self esteem. \n\nI just needed to rant. I\u2019ve been crying so much about this with no solution. I\u2019m tired lol", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p71vph/my_20s_were_challenging_also_you_will_work/h9j7w1p/"}
