I definitely will. I have felt like a failure this past year thinking I\u2019m dumb or in my head too much since I can\u2019t even make it out of my apartment to go to lab. But I\u2019m coming to terms that it\u2019s not my passion and I have to do what comes naturally to me. \n\nThis week has been so much emotion for me, because I have been feeling this lack of drive in my career. Even though it\u2019s been there for a while, this week it really hit and stuck with me the most\u2026I can\u2019t live a life without a career I\u2019m passionate about. \n\nI took this post as a sign that I\u2019m not crazy for being worried about this, and your words and replies mean a lot.
