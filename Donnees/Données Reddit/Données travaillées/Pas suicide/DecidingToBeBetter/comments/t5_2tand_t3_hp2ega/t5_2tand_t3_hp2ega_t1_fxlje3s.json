Really relaxing, non competitive games. There\u2019s a game called I Love Hue that is literally just arranging colors according to hue. It\u2019s kind of like a puzzle, but it\u2019s not the type of thing that would wake you up. I find it incredibly relaxing. Stardew Valley may also have a similar vibe. I think coloring book games might also be a good thing to try. \n\nOr, if the act of opening the book is the obstacle in your way from being able to read books while nursing, you might try getting some ebooks and reading on an app on your phone. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t try to do fiction with this, since it can be so gripping, but nonfiction, autobiographies, etc featuring people and subjects you find interesting might be a perfect and fairly non gripping transition. \n\nBest of luck with your little one!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hp2ega/alternative_to_social_media/fxlje3s/"}
