Just got back from my longest run yet (4 miles) and I'm starting to consider doing a half-marathon in half a year. I started by walking/jogging (mostly walking) a year ago very sporadically and really got into the habit earnestly a few months ago.\n\nJust a few of the great things I've personally noticed about really giving your cardiovascular system a good workout regularly for an extended period of time:\n\n* You increase blood-flow throughout the body which helps immensely with reducing a myriad of brain issues like depression, anxiety, and fog (A big component of these issues is often blood-flow not being adequate; diet has a big role as well)\n* You strengthen your heart, lungs/diaphragm, legs & core \u2014 just an overall healthy choice/nice thing in daily life\n* It stresses out your tendons and bones in a positive way, leading to them getting more resilient/healthier/stronger.\n\nI would imagine walking has similar benefits, just to a lesser degree. Personally I like to run/walk without music as I like to use the time to think and just let my mind wander/pay attention to the nature around me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz9jp5/ive_decided_to_go_on_a_walk_today/hezxkrt/"}
