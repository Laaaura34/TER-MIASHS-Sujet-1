Thank you for sharing! I'm glad it was such a beautiful and peaceful experience. The beauty of walking (or even hiking) is that you stumble across places you never knew of, as well as appreciate all the hidden treasures of our world. Definitely keep it up. Not too sure where you're from, but winter is coming soon for me so I'm getting out as much as I can.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz9jp5/ive_decided_to_go_on_a_walk_today/hezonkx/"}
