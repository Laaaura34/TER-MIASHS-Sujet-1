Walking has not only helped keep me healthy, but it has given me a way to feel like I'm somewhat in control of the situation. It's been 5 days since my diagnosis and I've walked 1.75 miles a day for 4 of those days. \n\nWhen I was younger, I walked or biked 4 miles a day just to get to and from work, and then some just for general purposes (like going to the store or visiting friends). My lifestyle was much unhealthier overall back then, but the daily exercise provided me with time to mentally unwind before and after work. I listened to a lot of good music, enjoyed the fresh air, and genuinely looked forward to the time I spent travelling between destinations. I never minded being caught in the rain or snow, and became accustomed to preparing for the weather to make my walks more comfortable. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz9jp5/ive_decided_to_go_on_a_walk_today/hf0lwcw/"}
