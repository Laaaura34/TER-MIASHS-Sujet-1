I do notice instant benefits when my thoughts are swirling in my head, weighing on my mind. I can sometimes physically feel the \"clouds\" dissipating. I don't listen to music - I either go totally silently or I talk my thoughts out to someone on the phone. Luckily I live at the outskirts of my city, so the streets are pretty quiet and there are a lot of trees. If you live in a busier part of your town, I advise going for a walk in nature, like a park or a small forest, that helps even more.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz9jp5/ive_decided_to_go_on_a_walk_today/hf2ogud/"}
