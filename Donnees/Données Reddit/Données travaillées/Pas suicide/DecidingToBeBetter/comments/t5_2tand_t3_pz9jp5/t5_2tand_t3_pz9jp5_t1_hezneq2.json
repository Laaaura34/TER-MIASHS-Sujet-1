I walked for about 40 min and a little less than 2 miles. Other than the busy street I had to pass, it was pretty peaceful. The neighborhood I went through was beautiful. The trees and plants were all super luscious and green. There were a ton of squirrels and birds, like A LOT. Overall it was a pretty good experience. I think next time I\u2019m gonna go to a park nearby that has nature trails. I\u2019ll bet it\u2019s beautiful this time of year.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz9jp5/ive_decided_to_go_on_a_walk_today/hezneq2/"}
