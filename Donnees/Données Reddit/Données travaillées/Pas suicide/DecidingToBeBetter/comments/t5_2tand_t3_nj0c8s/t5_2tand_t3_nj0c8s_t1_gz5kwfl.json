The rest is you being conscious as an immigrant. Hit me up if you want go talk about it.\n\n When my sibling wanted to try cosplay, I dismissed it because the character is fair and they are not. I have never felt superior or thought myself to be, but the prejudice that my sibling felt outside made it harder to believe that I don't carry that same prejudice and I still feel shit for not doing anything to dispel that.\n\nI also prefer a lighter skinned partner although I wouldn't go and adopt a white baby. That's weird and I guess you also want someone to say it back as well. But IT'S OKAY.
