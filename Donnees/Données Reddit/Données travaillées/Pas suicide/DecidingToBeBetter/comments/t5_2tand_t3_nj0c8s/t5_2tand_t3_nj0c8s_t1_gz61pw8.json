And finally, you do not have to feel ashamed. I am betting there are tons of people who feel the same way, whether you encounter them online or in person. There have been studies showing that children as young as kindergarten will mark a doll with light skin as \u201cprettier\u201d than a darker doll, because the message that whiteness is the ideal, whiteness is the default, is so deeply ingrained in so many aspects of western society. I do think it\u2019s getting better, but you can\u2019t fault yourself for negative conditioning you never asked for or wanted in your brain. But you can be part of it getting better by working to love, accept, and admire yourself as well as your culture/race/skin color.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz61pw8/"}
