Being able to realize that you have internalized racism is a BIG step in overcoming it, and it\u2019s a step that many don\u2019t even get to, so I applaud you for being self-aware and you should be proud of that as well.\n\nWe live in a very white, Eurocentric world where whiteness is the default in all media and consumption. That goes for social media, television, movies, commercials, music, etc. What has helped me to overcome my own internalized shame regarding my race is de-colonizing my everyday life and what I consume. I started following more creators from my race on social media, pinning them more on Pinterest, watching more shows and movies that are racially diverse and predominantly of my own race, watching YouTubers who are my race, listening to more music from my background, indulging in food from my culture, etc. I\u2019ve done this because doing the complete opposite before is what has caused me to have internalized racism in the first place.\n\nLike I said, this is still something that I am somewhat still working on, but I feel like de-colonizing yourself and what you consume is a huge step in making more progress.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz7fh8y/"}
