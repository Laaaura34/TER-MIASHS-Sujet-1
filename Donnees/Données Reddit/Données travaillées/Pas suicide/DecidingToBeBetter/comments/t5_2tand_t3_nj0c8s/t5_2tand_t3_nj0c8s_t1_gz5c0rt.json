Code switching isn\u2019t a bad thing. My dad is British and I speak with more of a British accent around my family but more of an American accent around others. Not at all racial, just conforming.\n\nGrowing up, kids do stupid things. You aren\u2019t defined by what you did as a kid. I wanted to be Asian growing up because I played in a youth orchestra and a lot of people were Asian. I always hoped someone would mistake me for Asian. I don\u2019t think that now because I\u2019m not a kid anymore. I\u2019m not a bad person for being a child and trying to make sense of race and neither are you.\n\n\n\n\nThings like being a \u2018coconut\u2019 are other people being racist towards you. They are telling you what you are allowed to like because of the color of your skin. You\u2019re allowed to like whatever you like. Of course you are watching films in English- you live in an English speaking country. You are allowed to do that. Also speaking English when you live in an English speaking country isn\u2019t anything to be ashamed of either. I\u2019m planning to move to a European country in the future and plan to speak the language there.\n\nWanting partners who are white is okay. You\u2019re allowed to have preferences, even if those preferences came from the fact more white women are shown as beautiful on tv than other races. You alone are not responsible for changing how the world represents beauty. You don\u2019t have to date someone you\u2019re unattracted to because you don\u2019t want to be racist. \n\nNot wanting people to make you look bad is not racism, it\u2019s wanting to fit in. The feeling you\u2019re describing is commonly called \u2018cringe,\u2019 and we only cringe at groups that are most like us. I cringe when vegans do and say something dumb because I\u2019m vegan and I don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m like the crazy vegans. It\u2019s natural.\n\nYou\u2019re not a bad person OP and you\u2019re only hurting yourself by beating yourself up and calling yourself racist.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz5c0rt/"}
