It\u2019s a long road to walk it o recovery but it\u2019s worth deconstructing every belief you have in your mind and the subtle effects and influences of living in a white society can have on you. One thing to be hyper aware of is many many people do not understand racism and what it means. They think racism = hate and other things. A LOT of white people and BIPOC  do not have a fundamental understanding of it even though the contrary will seem so. Racism is an ideology a worldview a belief a paradigm. Like any ideology it can be deconstructed with effort. By recognizing and becoming aware of the racism that has poisoned your mind, it will become easier to identify beliefs, actions, behaviors etc that propagate it\u2019s existence. You\u2019ll begin to see how society can cause you to absorb these ideals implicitly. Although they have good intentions on telling you \u201cyou just want to fit in\u201d its completely ignoring the causes of why and how you are going about it. They are being mindful of your feelings but it isn\u2019t helpful on a journey like this. \n\nI am glad you have decided to do better because it is a daily battle to fight the way you\u2019re mind is programmed. Cultural programming is an influence and in the end, you determine how much control it can exert of you and your behavior! Congratulations and I wish you further success on your deconstruction. If you want help identifying it I can help by pointing the way to resources books etc that can bring awareness to the different forms and expressions that racism and internalized racism can manifest itself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz5skr2/"}
