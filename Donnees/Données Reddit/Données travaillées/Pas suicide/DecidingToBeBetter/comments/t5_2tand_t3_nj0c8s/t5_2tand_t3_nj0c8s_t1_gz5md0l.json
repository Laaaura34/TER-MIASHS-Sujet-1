We're social creatures we interact we adopt practises. That part you can let go of culture is tied to geography not genetics. Being more attracted to exoctic (which is a realative term. fight me) women is also natural. It ensures genetic diversity between you and your breeding partner. Just live your best life and when you see some stranger acting out in public. Take a breath. Remind yourself \"That is a separate individual. That is not me. I am not responsible for what they are doing. That does not represent everyone that looks like them/me. I am proof.\" Embrace your individuality everything else is an exercise in misery.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz5md0l/"}
