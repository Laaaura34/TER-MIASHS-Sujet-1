I wish more people did this kind of difficult internal work. I know it is deeply uncomfortable. \n\nDo you hang out with people who share your culture & background?\n\nIm east Asian from a tiny country. I was lucky i had a robust community in the states to develop a certain \"pride\" in my culture.\n\nBut i did go through a phase where i was embarrassed that my parents didnt speak any English. I also went through a phase where i compares my culture to American culture and only focused on the negative aspects of my culture of origin.\n\nNow i am so happy to be bicultural and bilingual (although im way more comfortable with English). I am able to recognize good and bad parts of both of my cultures try to learn from both to become the best person i can be. This was such a struggle as my parents culture is completely opposite of what Americans value system.\n\nBut once you make it work somehow, not always consisrently, you revel in the beauty of being bicultural or multicultural. It is an enriching experience.\n\nDont give up on this journey. You have much to discover.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz674gv/"}
