Please don't be ashamed of this...you are doing the best you can. We are all on a journey and we don't know what we don't know. You have grown, realized what you are doing and you are ready to move beyond that. It's just part of your growth!\n\nI think talking to a professional would be a very good place to start, especially if you can find a therapist of color. It would also be cool to find ways to be proud of your culture; heritage groups, learning language or dance, participating in cultural events, learning to prepare types of food, volunteering with elders.  These things can give you a feeling of pride and a way to understand the strength and beauty of your culture. \n\nI'm rooting for you! You have a good heart and you can grow!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz58xat/"}
