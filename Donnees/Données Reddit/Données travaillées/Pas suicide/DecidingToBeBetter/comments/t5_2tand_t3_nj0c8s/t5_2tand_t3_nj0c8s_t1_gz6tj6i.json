If anything it's symptomatic of how entrenched racism is in today's globalized world.\n\nIt's not so much that you're trying to be white, as it is about you trying to avoid the shame of being considered inferior. I am willing to wager that you aren't even racist and that most of your presuppositions about yourself don't hold any water - for example, how you actually treat others/your respect for others has absolutely nothing to do with the colour of their skin. You say you desire a romantic partner who's white but I'm pretty sure if the right person was to come along, you would fall for him/her regardless of the randomly assigned colour of their skin.\n\nWhat you are experiencing is internalized shame - and it is more telling of how certain sections of society perceive you, than how you perceive them. And the best way you can negate these self-limiting beliefs is by becoming someone so amazing, that you aren't known for the color of your skin, but the color of your skin is known because of you.\n\nAll the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz6tj6i/"}
