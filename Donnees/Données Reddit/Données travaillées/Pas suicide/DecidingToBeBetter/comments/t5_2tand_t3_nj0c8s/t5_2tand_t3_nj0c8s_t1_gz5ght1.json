Part of putting on your big boy/girl pants is having the courage to confront that and work through it. Nobody with internal biases are bad people, at all. Don\u2019t let it become you and don\u2019t let it go on unfettered. \nLiving in a different culture than the one you were raised in or the one that you have at home is a different animal. Embrace what makes you who you are but don\u2019t ever let yourself feel imprisoned by one or the other. \nFinally, be proud that you had the courage to say this, but don\u2019t let this be your narrative. This is just how you feel on this date in May 2021. Be fluid. Be gentle with yourself and others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz5ght1/"}
