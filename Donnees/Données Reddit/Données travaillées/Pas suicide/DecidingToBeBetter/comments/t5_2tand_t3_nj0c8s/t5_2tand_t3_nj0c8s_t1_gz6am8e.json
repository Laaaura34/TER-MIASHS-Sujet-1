Maybe you\u2019re just trying to blend in with your surroundings? \n\nRacism is when you judge people on their color and despise them for it. It\u2019s not listening to different music and it\u2019s not dating different races. \n\n I, myself appreciate other cultures outside of my own. I love to listen to Japanese, Italian, or Portuguese music. I love different kinds of Cooking and art.\n\nIsn\u2019t it more cruel to say to yourself, \u201c I can only enjoy things in my own race?\u201d Isn\u2019t more racist to limit your self expression to the color of your skin? \n\nThink of it this way, if everyone did what their race wanted, wouldn\u2019t that make stereotypes and racism worse?  Think of how boring the world would be. You couldn\u2019t go to an Italian place for food, or go to a Shakespearean play. You couldn\u2019t enjoy rap or drink bubble tea. \n\nIn short, you are more than your skin color. You are your own person. You should celebrate and enjoy what you enjoy and stop worrying what everyone else thinks. You sound like a good person and you want to do the right thing, but don\u2019t punish yourself for enjoying what the world has to offer. Life is just too short for that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz6am8e/"}
