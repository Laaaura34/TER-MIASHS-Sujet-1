Everytime you have a thought like that, tell yourself that this isn't who you want to be. Tell yourself that this thought embarrasses you. Imagine those around you to be able to listen to your thoughts. Everytime you feel like you're being a coconut, shake your head (and I mean physically shake your head, whether you're on your bed or in the middle of a speech, shaking your head physically tells your mind that enough is enough) and shout \"NO!\" (in your head obviously, but if you're alone, say it out loud because it helps).\n\nOver the next few years, this will condition your mind the way you want it to be conditioned. It requires self awareness, but considering you made this post, you understand what must be done.\n\nThis isn't a quick process. It seems like you've had this problem for years, and it's especially difficult to change mindsets that have been developing since childhood. But over time, you'll begin to see this change.\n\nYou will get though this, I believe in you, and I'm here with you all the way bud.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz5fucu/"}
