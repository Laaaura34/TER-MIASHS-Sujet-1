Or to be seen with them? Did you not want to speak your native language in public because when they did it felt shameful?\nAnd did their culture cause you to cringe? \nIf you feel shame about your culture, I suspect it\u2019s more to do with fitting in & being accepted by your adopted homeland, rather than racism. \nIf it\u2019s more about feeling the colour of your skin is \u201cless than\u201d then you have bought into society\u2019s narrative about what is considered beautiful. You haven\u2019t specifically mentioned your ethnic background, but in a lot of Asian countries \u201cskin whitening\u201d products (face creams, etc) are pretty common. And \u201cdarker\u201d people are considered \u201cdirty\u201d or \u201clower class\u201d. Again, it\u2019s more about what is considered acceptable or attractive in society, rather than actual racism. \nRacism is more about saying that \u201cBecause I belong to this race, I am superior/better/more valued than you.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a fine line, but the fact that you are reflecting on your own cognitive bias, is the first step in transcending seeing people\u2019s worth by the colour of their skin.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz5g9gh/"}
