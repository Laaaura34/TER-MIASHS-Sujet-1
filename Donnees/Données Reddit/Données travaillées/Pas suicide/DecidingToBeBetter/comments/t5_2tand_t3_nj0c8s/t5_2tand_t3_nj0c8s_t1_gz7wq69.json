I see a lot of well-intentioned comments that don\u2019t really hit the issue at the core. People talking about fitting in when in reality there is a real culture of white worship in many people of color. It\u2019s not just OP\u2019s fault - white worship and colonized minds are very common and it\u2019s definitely something to address gently. \n\nOP you might see more upvotes and rewards given to that guy talking about fitting in. But it\u2019s so much more than that and it\u2019s such a massive topic - speak to others experiencing the same, the same way. Don\u2019t listen to the experiences of white people for this... as well intentioned as they may be it is just a vastly different topic on its own.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz7wq69/"}
