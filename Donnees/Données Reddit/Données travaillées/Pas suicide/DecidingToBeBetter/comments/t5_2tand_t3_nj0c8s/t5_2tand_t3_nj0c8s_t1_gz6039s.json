Instead, plan ahead to have certain diversionary ideas that you will focus on when needed.  When you notice yourself being overly self-critical, you acknowledge it without judging yourself for it, then deliberately move on to thinking about the other thing.  You can narrate this to make it easier, if that helps.  \"I am being self-critical.  That is okay, but now I am going to think about [the other thing].\"  The self-critical thoughts may come back while you're trying to divert, and that is also okay, and you just do the process again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz6039s/"}
