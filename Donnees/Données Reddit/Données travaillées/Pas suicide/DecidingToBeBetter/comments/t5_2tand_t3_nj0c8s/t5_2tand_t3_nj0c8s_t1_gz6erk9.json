You might have trauma from your childhood around moving somewhere and being different.  I am not a trained psychologist but this is not racism to me but shame and a desire to feel like you belong.  Right now the entire media and narrative of popular culture has been reduced to racism and the belief that everything revolves around it and that you can have unconscious bias.  You are conscious of it so that is false for you.. and you don\u2019t hate your own people.  You just want to feel like you belong.  I grew up a lot in Mexico and I love that country but I did not fit in and I remember having many thoughts that feel similar.  Ultimately mine were defined by my experiences though and were subtly different.  I was picked on and rejected for my heritage and it\u2019s differences at first but as I grew older and I kept trying to be authentic even when it made me incredibly nervous or incredibly ashamed... the people accepted me and ultimately I have many friends and relationships in Mexico to this day.  Learning to love yourself is not rooted in race. It\u2019s rooted in courage and love.  You need to give yourself both of those things and the community around you will follow.  Be kind to yourself through this. It might suck but if you can come to love yourself the rest become irrelevant.  \n\nThanks for sharing and good luck", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz6erk9/"}
