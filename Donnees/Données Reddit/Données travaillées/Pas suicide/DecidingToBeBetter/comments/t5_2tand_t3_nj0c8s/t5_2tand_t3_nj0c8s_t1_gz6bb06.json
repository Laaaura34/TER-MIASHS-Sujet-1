As an Asian man myself living in New York city I'm wondering how you came to this sort of thinking about your race. I'm really glad you recognize this stuff in yourself so I respect that, but how did you get the your previous beliefs about yourself?\n\nI don't think I've ever had these thoughts about my skin, language, or status that way.
