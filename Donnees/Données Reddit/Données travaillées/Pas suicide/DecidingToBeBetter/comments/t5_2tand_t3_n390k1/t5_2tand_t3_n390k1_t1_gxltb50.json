Funny thing is that I randomly stumbled upon Dr. K's video today before I even realized that you had linked to it in your response (I needed some space to think further about the info I've been learning about self-improvement, so I didn't respond to you right away). \n\nYou're totally right that focusing on self-improvement is only part of the equation, and I love that you said 'be self absorbed but have some direction to your introspection'. Dr. K's video basically reinforced my belief that too much introspection can be bad especially if it's not being used to see the bigger picture, so I agree with his and your points that being aware of how we approach our introspection is also important. Hope that made sense haha. Thanks again!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n390k1/a_new_insight_on_raising_selfesteem_not_being_so/gxltb50/"}
