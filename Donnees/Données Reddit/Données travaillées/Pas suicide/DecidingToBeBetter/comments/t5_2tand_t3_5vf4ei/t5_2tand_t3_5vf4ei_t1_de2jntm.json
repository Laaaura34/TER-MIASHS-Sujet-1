You're feeling the stress of life and it may be more overwhelming than you're either used to or expected.  You want some level of freedom and normality and so you're allowing yourself to indulge in order to protect your sanity.  I've been a teacher and I know it's not an easy job.  On top of that, you're also in grad school.  I've talked to literally thousands of people in your shoes over the past 8 years.  \nThere are a few things you can do.  1- allow yourself to accept that this will be your new reality for the next couple years until you graduate from grad school.  Resisting the reality creates another level of stress that compounds the situation. 2- prioritize and allow yourself to let some things go.  When you have too much to do, you can't expect yourself to excel at everything at the same time.  You have to focus and choose your battles. 3- learn a flexible scheduling system that builds in free time for yourself so that you have time to decompress and recharge. Time is finite but energy is infinite.  Learn to use and recharge your energy wisely.\nIf you want clarification on any of this, let me know.  There is always a way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5vf4ei/i_need_some_help_i_am_becoming_lazy_unmotivated/de2jntm/"}
