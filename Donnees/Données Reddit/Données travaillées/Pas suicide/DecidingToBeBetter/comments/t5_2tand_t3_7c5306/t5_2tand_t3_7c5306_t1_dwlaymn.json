Some of the common triggers are music, being alone or bored etc.And you know what? don't let your happiness be controlled by something you can't control.And it's never too late... you can get away with this habit of escapism but only if you try and have the motivation to do it which i'm pretty sure you have.One day sit in silence grab a paper and pencil and write everything that increases the chances of you losing control over yourself afterwards, try to avoid those triggers and hopefully one day you will be able to gain control over your thoughts.I get the point that it's not easy to get rid of old habits but it's not impossible either trust me!!...gd luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7c5306/struggling_with_an_inferiority_complex_and/dwlaymn/"}
