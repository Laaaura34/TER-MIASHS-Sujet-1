Having a second brain to tell your story to, and talk with about your perceptions on the matter can be helpful. \n\nSometimes that's just how life happens, and sometimes it's because of something we've done. It's always gonna be a combination of the two. \n\nIt sounds like you're particularly quick to attribute everything to a particular 'fault' of yours though, rather than mere circumstance. Other people in your life also have 'faults', as well as their own individual circumstances they may regret or resent, but all of it (plus your complex self) has ultimately resulted in the history you share. Try to keep an open mind about it :)\n\nEdit: Next time this comes up, consider talking with the person about the matter. Really use the conversation as an opportunity to explore what you don't know, and what the other person is perceiving.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2064m/im_afraid_im_not_a_good_person_the_people_i_have/hfiiti6/"}
