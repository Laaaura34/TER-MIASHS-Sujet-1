If you know it isn\u2019t true and that you try your hardest stick to that. Anyone blaming you for a relationship ending doesn\u2019t know how to take responsibility for their actions. That\u2019s their issue not yours. Try not to internalize other people\u2019s flaws. You know you. Those people simply didn\u2019t deserve you. Maybe that\u2019s the lesson in all of this. You have to be very very selective with who you spend your time with and who you give your energy to. People get mad when they can\u2019t use you for their own benefit. Don\u2019t place blame on yourself. Start doing what\u2019s best for you and don\u2019t feel bad about it! It\u2019s your life!
