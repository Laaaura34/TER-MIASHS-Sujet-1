I\u2019m just thinking about the relationships I\u2019ve had in the past and each one has usually angrily pointed the finger and said \u201cYou only think of yourself!\u201d or something to that effect.\n\nWhen I hear that, it\u2019s so strange to me because I literally do everything I can to make someone happy. And again, I fail sometimes and might want or try something for myself, but the way I see it, it\u2019s fine to have some self-care or maybe indulge yourself a little bit. I just want to see someone happy and hopefully, grow a happy relationship together.\n\nBut their accusations make it seem like I never cared for them at all. And it hurts me deeply because I feel in my head that it\u2019s not true. However, they always bring that doubt into my mind and it\u2019s so consuming.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2064m/im_afraid_im_not_a_good_person_the_people_i_have/hfhxbi1/"}
