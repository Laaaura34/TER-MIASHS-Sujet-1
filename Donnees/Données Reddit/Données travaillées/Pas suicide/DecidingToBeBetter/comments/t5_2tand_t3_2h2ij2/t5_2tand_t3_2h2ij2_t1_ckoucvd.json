Helped a TON with posture. \n\nGenerally I tell people to look up proper posture, and look in the mirror and keep moving yourself around till you've found the perfect position for whatever you're working on. From then on out, just constantly remind yourself to do that every day. Put little reminders somewhere like you're phone, so every time you check it, you fix your posture. \n\nI've also started working on posture while seated and what my hands/arms are doing at all times, and utilizing my body language to my full potential. You could definitely look at those to continue your posture work!  ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2h2ij2/whats_your_secret_of_good_posture/ckoucvd/"}
