I used to try to change them, nag them, argue with them, and the like. It caused friction between us and I realized that it is not my right nor my job to change them. No amount of trying will get someone to change if he or she does not want to do it, period. It is OK to help them if they request help.\n\nWhat I do now is love them from a distance, so to speak. I do not let them affect my desire to get better and I go about my business independently. I do not see these people as much anymore because, often, their activities (drinking, smoking, lack of exercise, improper nutrition, etc) are counter productive to what I want to achieve. If they ask me why I do not 'hang out' as much anymore, I tell them that I am busy trying to improve my life via the gym, cooking healthy food, meditation, etc. I tell them that they can join me if they'd like, but that is it.\n\nOne of the best lessons in life that I have learned is that it is important to be able to say NO to others. I also learned that the friends we  associate with greatly affect our own lives. It is important to associate with people with similar values and goals.\n\nI will end with this metaphor: on an airplane, when needed, you always should place the oxygen mask on yourself first before you attempt to help anyone else.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4pg6qe/how_to_deal_with_complacent_friends/d4l0w8x/"}
