Now that I'm older I regret that.  Be thankful you had those times, keep working on yourself, and if your friends aren't okay with it / mock you for it then they aren't worth keeping super close.  Also I recommend finding some additional friends or acquaintances who reinforce your good habits.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4pg6qe/how_to_deal_with_complacent_friends/d4kplks/"}
