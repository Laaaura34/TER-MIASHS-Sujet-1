Im 38years old and just got diagnosed with ADHD. The motivation part - I can see know - is from the ADHD. And after some considerations I have tried some pills. I helps getting things done a lot. Before I could think about a specific task for days on end without doing it. Now that is better. I still have the motivation-pattern doing things in the last moment. But with the ADHD many have problems with measuring time-use. And just by knowing that now and telling my mind that it\u2019s an issue I can feel small changes in the way I\u2019m thinking about myself and that self-acceptance is starting to grow. I accidentally thought that is good in messuring time, because I can tipucally set a clock for 20min nap and wake up a 1minute  beforehand. But with eany other task I don\u2019t have eany time-reculexion at all. The millions of times I came 5minuts late for school even though the school where my nextdoorneirbour has always been a puzzle for me why I could do so well in school and not manage that simple task to be on time. \n\nThe self-sabotage I\u2019m still now aware of why - but every single night I use 50% of all Brain-energy for 4-5hours thinking about... I can\u2019t go to bet early and usually it\u2019s a sort of self-sabotage... \n\n... I\u2019m not good at structure and I hate doing things that I feel someone is forcing me to, so notifications for going to sleep is not working at all. (Eventhought i made the notification myself and it\u2019s I\u2019m my best interest. I still feel forced, so I resist) \n\nI\u2019m hoping to find a solution my self one day. Many times I can trick my brain saying I\u2019m doing it for some one else\u2019s fouled. But not this sleeping. \n\nI get very little sleep and usually I sleep after 3o\u2019clock like today/night... ...eventhough I know the bad effects Of lack of sleep I can\u2019t change it - yet!! - what ever I try it\u2019s just getting worse. May years like that is not good but my Brian doesn\u2019t care... \n\nStreaks are very effective on me. I did meditiaon with an app with streaks and more then 100th days I made it. It helped me and my brain a lot with mediation. But one day the app crashed and the streak where lost. After some emails I got them backs but with 8less then it was in realliaty. I stoped meditation instantly... (stupid but true)\n\nIs it self sabotage in everything or just some specific?? \n\nAnd advice: are you an adult look up adult adhd and also if you a a woman (can\u2019t see it), look up adhd adult woman.
