Still doesn't take away from the pain but a lot of people who go through getting an STD seek counseling and having someone to talk to might help a lot. \n\nEdit: I speak as someone with a long history of addiction. Counseling had helped me in life more then any medication ever could. Life is hell for me right now because I'm working a job I hate and have a record that markes me to employers like the scarlet letter. I'm waiting for my record to be cleaned in the meantime.
