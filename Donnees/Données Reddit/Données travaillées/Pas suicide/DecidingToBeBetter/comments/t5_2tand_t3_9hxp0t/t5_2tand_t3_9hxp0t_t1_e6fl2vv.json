Currently. That's the hardest part about being damaged, admitting that you currently are sick in a way that prevents you from feeling happiness.\n\nThe good thing is that once you overcome that ego and that pain of the realization, you can then slowly and steadily work on yourself and build yourself back toward emotional stability and happiness. You will get back to being happy again. You will get back to being okay. It's just a matter of committing to the process and putting in the hard work to get back to a stable place.
