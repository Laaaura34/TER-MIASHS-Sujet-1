Ultimately you have to choose between that occasional disappointment or the loneliness that comes with closing yourself off from everyone. There is no \"going back\", only acceptance of the fact that relationships rarely work out the way they do in our fantasies about them. \n\nThe bright side is that once you get to know someone well enough, you can sometimes predict the times they will disappoint you and prepare yourself for that emotional impact. While that doesn't justify their (in)action(s), it makes it easier to forgive them for their forgivable imperfections and move on without damaging the relationship as much as you might if you chose to have giant arguments about everything. Getting to that point with someone takes time, patience, and a level of communication that most people are not comfortable with, which requires both people to step outside their comfort zones willingly and frequently.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9hxp0t/i_feel_like_im_too_damaged_to_be_happy_again/e6fddja/"}
