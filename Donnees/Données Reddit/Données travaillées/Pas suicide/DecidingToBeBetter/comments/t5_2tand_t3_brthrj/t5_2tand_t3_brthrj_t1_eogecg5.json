Awareness empowers you. You can either accept or change. Awareness gives you that choice.\n\nThat said, I would start small and slowly build up. Set yourself small realistic goals on a daily and a weekly basis. Remember making excuses and avoiding responsibility is ingrained in many and are deep seated habits.\n\nStart small and build it every day. If you try to be the perfect human being straight away, you will undoubtably slip into your old ways very quickly (you will anyway it\u2019s inevitable), you will then become demoralised, as you have \u201cfailed\u201d and then give up.\n\nJust be aware, be honest, try your best, and cut yourself some slack. In a year you will thank yourself.\n\nI wish you luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/brthrj/done_with_excuses_and_avoidance/eogecg5/"}
