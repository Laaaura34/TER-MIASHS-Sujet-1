This means whatever path you pursue you won't have many role models to look up to, or people to help you out. This includes dating as whatever you are. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think there's a way to get the things we would get if, in a different reality, we were white or more 'thug' or whatever. At best we can be aware of the disadvantage of society and try to do our best around them.
