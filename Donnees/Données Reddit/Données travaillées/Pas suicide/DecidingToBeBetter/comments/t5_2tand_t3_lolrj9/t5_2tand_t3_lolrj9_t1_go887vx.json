Practice being less judgmental overall.  The core of your problem sounds judging yourself in this case.  Practice trying not to judge other people, situations and more importantly yourself.  Get cut off in traffic? Don't call them a jerk mentally. The less you do things like that the more empathetic you will be with the end goal being more empathetic towards yourself.\n2. Get comfortable asking questions.  Asking questions is just a good conversation technique.  It doesn't matter how smart you or the other person is.  If they are talking about something they find interesting and you ask questions they are going to love answering them.  Additionally a 'smart' person is just someone who has learned a lot and the best way to learn is to ask questions.  Win-win situation for both of you.\n3. Practice conversation with people in general.  A great place to practice at store check outs because your conversation can only last for a short period of time.  Smile, ask how there day is going, etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lolrj9/i_shut_down_and_get_incredibly_anxious_when_im/go887vx/"}
