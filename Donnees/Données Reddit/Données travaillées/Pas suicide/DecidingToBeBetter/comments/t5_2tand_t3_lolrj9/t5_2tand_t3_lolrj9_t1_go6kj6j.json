I\u2019m curious what sort of inner dialogue happens for you in these moments? Are you becoming so preoccupied with what\u2019s happening in your head (thoughts like \u201coh no, what am I going to say next?\u201d) that you\u2019re going blank? I wonder what would happen if, in the moments you\u2019re speaking with someone that has this affect on you, you just became really, really curious about them and what they were saying. One of my favorite expressions is: \u201cthe best way to be interesting is to be interested.\u201d People like talking about themselves!
