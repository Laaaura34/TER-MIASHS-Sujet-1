And once there, the focus becomes on escape and preservation, not on holding an engaging conversation (thanks evolution). So I don't think it's your intelligence that's an issue, so much as your self-confidence.\n\nNot to mention, \"smart\" as a concept is super nebulous. I'd like to think I'm smart, but I'm absolute garbage at trivia. Does that mean I'm actually dumb? I don't think so. It's just there are many ways to be \"smart\".
