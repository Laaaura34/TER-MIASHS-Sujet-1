This isn\u2019t a negative trait, simply a trait. You can force yourself past the shyness but it will require more effort and energy than it does for others; and when that energy runs low you will definitely resort to your nature of being shy. This is okay.\n\nOpportunities will present themselves if you put yourself out there.\n\nLife should be fairly routine and mediocre, while still allowing you the full human experience. Put the right things into your routine and you will have a good life. Sounds like occasionally you will need to take risks that you are uncomfortable with; but just be yourself, don\u2019t deny your nature, simply work with it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2jyhq/rip_to_the_opportunities_i_lost_due_to_my_shyness/h8kkyys/"}
