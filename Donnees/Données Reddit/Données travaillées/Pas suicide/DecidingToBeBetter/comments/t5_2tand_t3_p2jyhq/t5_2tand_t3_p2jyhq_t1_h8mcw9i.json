I would also have panic attacks when talking to people. Somehow I got a sales job. Sometimes I would start to freak out in a home and make an excuse to go back to my car and get something. But, I got over it.\n\nFirst thing I did was stop drinking coffee and and source of caffeine. Panic attacks went away by about 99%. The practice of being in front of people over and over again in that sales job got me use to people.\n\nThen the next thing that happened that helped me to overcome and be comfortable with public speaking is I stopped watching porn. I realize now that was wiping out any confidence I could muster up. Porn and any other stupid stuff that makes you feel bad about yourself deep inside is going to cause a lack of self confidence  or shyness. The other thing was that I was given public speaking jobs in a church I started going to. I was having a hard time breathing doing this at first. And, I am sure it was obvious. But, I fought through it and never gave up. Now, I am comfortable with it after doing it so many times.\n\nYou can get over this shyness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2jyhq/rip_to_the_opportunities_i_lost_due_to_my_shyness/h8mcw9i/"}
