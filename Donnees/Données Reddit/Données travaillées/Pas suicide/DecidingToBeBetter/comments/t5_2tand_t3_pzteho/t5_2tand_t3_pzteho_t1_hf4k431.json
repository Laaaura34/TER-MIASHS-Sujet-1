Since we are human, we have been hardwired to focus on negatives because it\u2019s what\u2019s kept us safe: I am caveman & I saw my caveman buddy eat a berry & now he is dead, that berry is bad & my caveman brain will remind myself how bad it is so I end up don\u2019t eating it. You can see how over time it\u2019s become second nature, which sucks but you can take action. \n\nPersonally I am a Christian, but I feel this saying works for any religion or atheist. I always remind myself that it\u2019s not my job to judge people, it\u2019s the creators or fates job to judge. Judging others is like me trying to play god & be the ultimatum of right & wrong, & that\u2019s not fair to anyone including myself.\n\nAnother note: not judging people has been such a great impact, it makes life seem less chaotic, like more vibrant & joyful. Most of my friends are people I wouldn\u2019t have thought of talking to but said \u201cfuck it, let me meet you\u201d & turns out they are amazing people, they have opened so many opportunities & taught me so much & I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzteho/i_decide_to_be_less_judgmental/hf4k431/"}
