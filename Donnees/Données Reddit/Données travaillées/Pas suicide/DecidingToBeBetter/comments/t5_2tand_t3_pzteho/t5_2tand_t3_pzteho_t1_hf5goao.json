I didn't have some of the bad traits that annoyed me very much, but one day I took time to think and I realized that, in some way, I did have some of those traits (the tricky part is that some bad traits can disguise as other things)\n\nAfter that moment I became way less judgmental of others.\nA note: not everything that annoys you about someone needs to correspond to what you hate about yourself. Some people just take some traits to the extreme and some traits are inherently undesirable.\n\n\nAlso, as others have said, thinking from the perspective of others is a very important step.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzteho/i_decide_to_be_less_judgmental/hf5goao/"}
