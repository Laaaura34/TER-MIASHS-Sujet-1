Lost and confused with no idea what you're doing.\n\nBut just because it's common doesnt mean you should deal with it. If I were you I'd book an appointment with a therapist to talk all of this out with (trust me it helps) and then maybe try picking up a hobby. Any hobby. Maybe a sport you used to like or anything that makes you happy. I wish I could help more but I feel exactly how you feel. Good luck! Dont forget to pet all the dogs and cats and enjoy the sun and flowers!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ea1hhi/i_dont_know_who_i_am/fan7jr9/"}
