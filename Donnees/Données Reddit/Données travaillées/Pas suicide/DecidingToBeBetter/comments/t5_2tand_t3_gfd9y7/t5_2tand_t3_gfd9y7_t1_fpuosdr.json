I just told my husband tonight that I should have gone to law school but that I feel I'm too old now. I should have stayed in college but I didn't. I am female and was unable to have children and had to have a hysterectomy. Now my life is OK but boring and I'd love to go back to school and make a career for myself but I'm 44 now so I'm not sure if it's even a thing to go back to school at my age. Best of luck to you OP you are doing it right I'm happy for you that you took the steps you needed to take to get your life on track.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fpuosdr/"}
