I can do this! Our stories have alot of similarities, although you're a bit younger and got your shit together sooner (good for you!)\n\ntoday is my 32nd birthday and i'm finished my first week of my online nursing program. still 2 years to go. 2 year LPN in Canada. If I went back in time to 19 year old university drop out Me and told him i'd be training to be a male nurse, 19Me would have laughed. But that kid was a fucking loser who was mean to his girlfriend; one of the coolest girls he'd ever meet, and had absolutely no direction in life. I've done a lot of soul searching and this is my first step into my goal (of which I admit is still being fleshed out) of a rewarding career in health care. I'll cherish the 5-10 years I have planned to be working; helping people as a nurse but by that time i'll be upgrading to a loftier career in health care.  The loftiest possibility is upgrade to a GP by age 50, or perhaps a Masters of science in Nursing. The sky is the limit; I have my confidence back!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fpu07xw/"}
