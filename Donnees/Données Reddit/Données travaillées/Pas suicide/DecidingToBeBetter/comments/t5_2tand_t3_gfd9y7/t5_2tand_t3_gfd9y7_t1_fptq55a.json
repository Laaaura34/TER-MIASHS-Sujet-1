That hits me hard.  Ever since I failed out of college (I got back in and finished, albeit with a useless Art History degree after switching through Chem, physics, then math) I feel like I've failed at everything in my life. I'm nearly 42 now, work for the post office (which I despise) and deliver pizza to try to get on track financially. \nI'm overweight, feel like crap all the time, hate my life, and have pretty much given up on the idea that I am strong enough to fight the rapids  of life that have me. Everything I have tried to do to improve my life I have either ended up making poor decisions trying to do the \"right thing\", been screwed over through chance, or given up on. I've been overwhelmed with trying to fix all the aspects of my life that are shit, and held back by obligations to family/ my significant other.\n Now facing this pandemic and the likely recession that should follow... I feel stuck in a life I hate.  I'm living in a house with my brother and significant other that we inherited (along with the mortgage). I want to end things with her, but she has nowhere else to go for her and her son. I was starting to learn to code and enjoying it... But between both jobs I'm far too busy to keep up with it now.\nDon't get me wrong, I know people have it worse, though, there are people who have it even worse than those people. We can only deal with what we've experienced, and my mind tortures me almost daily.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fptq55a/"}
