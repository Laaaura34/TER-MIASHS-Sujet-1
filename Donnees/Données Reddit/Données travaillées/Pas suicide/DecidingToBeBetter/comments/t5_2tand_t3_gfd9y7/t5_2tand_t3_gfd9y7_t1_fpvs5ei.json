Had I redone 3 gen Ed\u2019s that I didn\u2019t need this time around, but still count against my gpa, I\u2019d be at a 3.8+. Instead I\u2019ll finish around 3.53 I believe, which is Magna at my school. I know other schools have higher GPA\u2019s for honors, but that\u2019s what it is here. This university also does not award A+\u2018s, which apparently can make a difference? Idk. Either way I think defining ourselves with numbers sucks, but it\u2019s the way it is for now. Hope that answered your question!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fpvs5ei/"}
