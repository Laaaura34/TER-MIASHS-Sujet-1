I\u2019m not sure to stick with anything long term. I often question my planning ability. I question my own general abilities. I am very good at dreaming up intentions, but following them for more than 2 weeks is often a losing bet. \n\nI think I may, in time, begin to make serious progress. But it is one step at a time, and once I falter in one step I usually end up giving up on taking anymore.\n\nI\u2019m saving your post for that day that I do. I hope that it helps me to find something more in myself to take at least one more step.
