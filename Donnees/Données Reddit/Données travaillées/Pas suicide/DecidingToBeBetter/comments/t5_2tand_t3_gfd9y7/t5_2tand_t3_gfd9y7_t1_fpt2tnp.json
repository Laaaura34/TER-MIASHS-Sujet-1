In a month I\u2019m writing tests that will determine my ability to get to a decent university(kinda like SATs, but not really since I don\u2019t live in the US). Honestly I haven\u2019t been feeling good about all of this recently, but you just managed to help. I have to admit I\u2019m really grateful for it, even if it\u2019s just for this short moment. Thanks a lot :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fpt2tnp/"}
