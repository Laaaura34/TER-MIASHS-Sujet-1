Been single for 2 years 100% out of choice. Last girl was a nightmare. >.< She was my Karma as I was a nightmare to others.\n\nI'm really enjoying my solitude. I'm actually at this weird place where I'm considering never getting married. Never having kids. I'm a serial monogamist and was even with my highschool sweetheart for 6.5 years. Never thought I'd want to stay single.\n\nTL/DR\n\nI observe friends with kids. Critically. I observe couples. I observe my parents, who I made the difficult and perhaps foolish decision to live with while doing my online schooling. These people don't seem happier than me. Their lives are full of conflict and stress. They cannot think or act for themselves... I find myself asking \"perhaps I was just conditioned to believe that 'success' ment marriage\". I mean sure, they get to have 'regular' sex with someone who they are getting sick of, and yes I miss sex but if that's the only thing that's keeping me in a relationship, the negatives outway way the one (admittedly pretty great) positive.\n\nLet's just cherish our independence while we can. Only way I'm getting back into the couples' life is if an awesome woman who takes my breath away happens to waltz into my life. Until then, i'ma do me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fpu1alb/"}
