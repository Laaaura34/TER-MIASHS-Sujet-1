I only passed the first half of the test. My teacher at that time even arranged for me to do the second part again, since she believed I was gifted, but I failed again. However, I did qualify for the IB program, but I quit after one year anyway, since the school was too far away and I was too lazy to commute.\n\nThe thing is, I know it\u2019s okay to not be good at things, and people become good by working hard, but I somewhat still have that superiority complex I did from back then, and I FEEL like I should be good immediately because I am superior, even though logically I know that\u2019s wrong.\n\nLike, I feel like I already know most of this, but that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t actually believe in it, and I want to change that.\n\nBut I\u2019ll try that Wikipedia thing out, it seems fun and I have nothing to lose, thanks for that idea!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9pljp/how_to_start_enjoying_things/hgxse5m/"}
