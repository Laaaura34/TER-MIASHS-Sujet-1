I try to be active everyday to help get me to sleep and stay asleep.\n\nSo I think it just depends on the person. I don\u2019t believe you need 8 hours of sleep. I rather get 6 hours of solid sleep than 8hours of tossing and turning.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mfb6ui/do_you_think_its_better_to_prioritize_getting_8/gsp5mvz/"}
