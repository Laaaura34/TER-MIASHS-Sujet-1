I read the question and I entered to reply already that you should be looking for a therapist if you're wondering if you should. I think it's something helpful for anyone, but if you're struggling with something, which you're saying you are, then I see it very clear. Also you don't need to be depressed to go to therapy. There are many other problems that might be less bad, but still very worth it to work on.\nI myself took also a long time deciding if I needed one. I've been in 6 sessions now and my only regret is not having looked for help sooner. And your problem sounds a bit similar to how I felt.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1xrci/when_its_time_to_see_a_therapist/h8ggwlr/"}
