Show this post to your partner and your therapist. \n\nBy writing anonymously to strangers you've likely been more frank and honest about your problems, your fears and your desire for change than you have ever been with them.\n\nIt's easy to hold the most vulnerable parts of yourself back when you're talking face to face. And it's especially easy to want to keep the worst parts of it hidden, you might even rationalize it to yourself by thinking you're doing them a favor. You're not.\n\nIn fact, you're probably doing them a disservice, and to yourself as well.\n\nJust say, \"I've been trying to deal with all of this, and I wrote this anonymously on reddit. But then I realized it explains things more honestly than I've been able to, and I think you should read it.\" \n\nYou don't need to share comments, or even show her the actual post, just the text that you wrote. But the biggest thing your relationship needs is for the two of you to be on the same page, and so any of the above stuff that you've never shared, THAT is the stuff where you need to be open and in sync.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcdig2/porn_addiction_unloading_accepting_accountability/hal3a90/"}
