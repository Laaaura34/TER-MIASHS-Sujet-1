That's why the old adage of \"nothing in excess everything in moderation\" needs to be part of everyone's lives.\n\nIn your case it is Porn. But many people become addicted to other forms of entertainment such as gambling or gaming or Facebook or Social Media...etc.\n\nNow since everything is so readily available more and more people are becoming addicted. Specially at a young age. Our kids with electronics...they can't get away from their phones or games etc. \n\nEverything in moderation. WE HAVE A PROBLEM.\nIT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM. Not just you but for 10s of millions of people. \n\nThe good thing is that you can rewire your brain.\nJust like you were able to rewire it for Porn. The hard part is that it is very difficult because our brains want that dopamine hit. It wants to feel good all the time and not suffer or feel bad. \n\nBest of luck. \n\nI recommend David Goggins message if you want to do what is hard...which is to rewrite your brain to suffer and not just look for pleasure.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcdig2/porn_addiction_unloading_accepting_accountability/hai5lr8/"}
