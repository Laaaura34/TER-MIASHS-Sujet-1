I think I definitely have a broader social media addiction, which I'm hoping to bring up with my therapist. I loved 4Chan when I was younger (stayed off /b/ for the most part cause that place was weird) because of the rabid-fire posts. Before that it was StumbleUpon. Then it was Tumblr, and at one point it was Reddit (I've cut back a lot). Social media is rad when used properly (like porn I guess!) but it's a tricky thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcdig2/porn_addiction_unloading_accepting_accountability/haicu1i/"}
