Man I can feel you completely. When we were younger, we never thought that we will get into hardcore porn. The scientific reason is that. When one is starting porn, the brain satisfies with moderate dopamine. But as long time after, brain develops neural pathways so it needs more and more dopamine (the pleasure chemical) and won't feel pleasure from small things. Imagine as a child you will never go to hardcore. But even if one watches softcore, eventually he will come to hardcore because of this reason. Butbthe good news is that if given time brain will reset these pathways and pleasure centers.\n\n\nThe other reasons is that we can view tons of nude women in just a minute because of internet. There is research on bulls that if they see one cow only  they won't get much aroused again and again. But if they get see to as many cow as want, brain gets hikes again and again. That's what makes it addictive. If you see one all the time, you won't find as addictive unless genuine need.\n\n\nI am not much into heavy but it troubles me too. I try to read scientific books, get to know why I am doing what I am doing. I recommend easy peasy method book, its got nice explainations. But at the end it's hard, only you have to do this. I am trying too. But I watch it and I want to stop it too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcdig2/porn_addiction_unloading_accepting_accountability/haja1xg/"}
