As soon as I made a conscious decision to step away from that I felt so much better about a lot of things. \n\nBased off what you have written I hope you can learn to love yourself. Therapy, meditation, talking to people, anything that can reflect yourself back at you, in my experience will help you immensely. You (arguably) may have an unhealthy PART of your brain right now and just needs some time to do some rewiring. You are still valuable, you still matter. \n\nOne thing a therapist told me about suicidal thoughts, is that it isn't your mind telling you it wants to end, just end it's current experience. Aka something has to change. It sounds like you are already making some changes in the right direction. But I really hope you can learn to love and forgive yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcdig2/porn_addiction_unloading_accepting_accountability/hajabf1/"}
