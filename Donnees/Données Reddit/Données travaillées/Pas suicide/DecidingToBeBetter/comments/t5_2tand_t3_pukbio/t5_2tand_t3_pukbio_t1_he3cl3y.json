Think about how many times you make a comment and then watch it to see how many people like it. In life you don\u2019t have someone following you around saying things like, \u201cawesome, that looks delicious, and LOL\u201d, so why do you need the approval from people you don\u2019t really know. I base my success off of my level of happiness. This requires me to think back about the days I would look at my bank statement of $100 and had to decide whether to buy groceries or gas for my car. When I think of that I know I am in a much better place now. If you keep comparing yourself you will never be where you think you should be.
