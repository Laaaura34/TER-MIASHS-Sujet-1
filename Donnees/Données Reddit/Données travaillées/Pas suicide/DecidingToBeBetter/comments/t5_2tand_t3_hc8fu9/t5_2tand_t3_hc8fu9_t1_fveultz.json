If I can suggest, I believe in how well meditation works to keep anxiety and depression at bay. Not necessarily a cur-all, but coupled with your medicines, you could potentially look into it as a booster for your regimen. It only really needs a about 10 - 15 minutes a day per session, or multiple sessions of it if you're having a difficult day.\n\nAs fr schooling, now is a good time to look into online courses. Sometimes you can find a lot on Coursera or other online programs, but look into what you're passionate about and what you enjoy. Our passions in life can be a significant driver to lead the way towards good goals, and the motivation to keep going will always stick around, since it's a big part of you already.\n\nI do agree that several trades work just as well ad usually fair better as 'right-away' work. Schooling will take time and dedication, so if you can pick up a trade to get into where it feels right, that could also be a successful path. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hc8fu9/ive_decided_now_what/fveultz/"}
