In 2015 I finally had the ability to not work 60 hr weeks and went back for another degree. Got that in 2017. That degree was in parallel w my 1st and my field. In 2018 I started another lol done in 2021. This one is completely different but will help my landscape design biz and expand my ability to branch out in differing economies. I LOVE taking classes, meeting new people & making friends, learning & all the challenges that come along! It keeps my brain young, my knowledge up to date, helps me network etc. If you ever feel overwhelmed message me or not sure about the tech side of classes! Best of luck, you can do this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ih1ufb/im_35_and_finally_going_back_to_school_on_monday/g2y4azq/"}
