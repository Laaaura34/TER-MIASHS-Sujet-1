I like my family but at a distance.  I even was obligated into bringing chicken and baking cupcakes to go with the cakes SOMEONE ELSE was obligated into bringing to the party!  The parents don't work, and live with their mom who also doesn't work, now these are able bodied people mind you, but that's none of my business.  So they struggle with money of course since no one works and obligated many of the family members into buying all of the food and favors for the party.  \n\nSo the party was shitty, the kid got more than my kids ever do and, again, out of obligation I invited them to our kid's party which they all RSVP'ed for, 4 people plus an extra, and then they no showed us on the party.  I couldn't care less about a gift or anything like that but it made me realize how much obligation was involved in this scenario and NO MORE!  It's silly, I didn't enjoy the party, didn't really want them at my house and don't really like being invited to a party where I have to take a gift a meal and the cake, for the joy of being included!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f8blv2/from_today_im_going_to_say_no_for_the_things_i/finwohb/"}
