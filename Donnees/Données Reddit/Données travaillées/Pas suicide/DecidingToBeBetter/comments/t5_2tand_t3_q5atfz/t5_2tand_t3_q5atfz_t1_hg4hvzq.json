I\u2019ll do my best. So my understanding is that we learn to understand love in a similar way to how we learn a language. So for example, if your parents showed you love by spending quality time with you then you will likely understand that quality time together = love. However, if your partner has learned that gift giving is how you show love then there may be issues in understanding one another. So say that mine is quality time, then I may be begging my partner to show me love and they could be buying me the most wonderful gifts in the world but I wouldn\u2019t understand that as love because they aren\u2019t spending quality time with me. This could leave me feeling kind of neglected and my partner feeling like they just don\u2019t know what else they can do because they\u2019re trying their best. So yeah, different people have different \u201clove languages\u201d (the 5 love languages are: quality time, gift giving, physical touch, words of affirmation and acts of service). It\u2019s important we learn what our partners love languages are so that we can show them love in a way that they understand and appreciate. I hope that makes sense", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5atfz/how_to_become_a_less_selfish_partner/hg4hvzq/"}
