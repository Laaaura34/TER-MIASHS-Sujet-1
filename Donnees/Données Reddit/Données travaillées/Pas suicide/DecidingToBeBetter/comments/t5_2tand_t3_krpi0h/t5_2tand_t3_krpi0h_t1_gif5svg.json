Find people who see your potential and appreciate your efforts. As a therapist I know that having this kind of support is so so important - and it feels great too:) Just remember while it's nice to have others around you, it's also vital to have this same appreciation and belief in yourself! Keep reminding yourself that you're amazing and you've got this! Say a mantra or write down some positive statements and put them up on your wall/mirror - whatever you need :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/krpi0h/go_where_you_are_appreciated/gif5svg/"}
