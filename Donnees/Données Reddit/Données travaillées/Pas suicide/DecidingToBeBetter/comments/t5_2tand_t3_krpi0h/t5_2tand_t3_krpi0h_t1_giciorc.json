I went from a crazy drunk party girl to a fit and healthy exercise freak. I've been seeing less and less of my old friends, but making new ones instead. Fellow exercise junkies who are so supportive and encouraging. My old friends would just laugh at the states I'd get in. I've been reluctant to let those friendships go, but really they serve no purpose to me anymore. \nSurround yourself with people who will life you up, not put you down. It's amazing when you find your tribe.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/krpi0h/go_where_you_are_appreciated/giciorc/"}
