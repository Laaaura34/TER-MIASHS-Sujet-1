I'm not going to claim I know it all, all I can go off is my personal experiences. And I can tell you that timing is absolutely everything. You might be sick of how your life is and you might not know how to get better, you might struggle for what seems like forever. But one day, you will wake up and change will come naturally. Nothing can explain why it happens and I can't tell you when it will happen, but it will. When you eventually get fed up of living the life you live, change will become your only option. Time is your best friend when it comes to healing. Hang in there and know that it will get better. Wishing you the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q79d3j/the_key_to_self_improvement_is_learning_to_be/hgip2aq/"}
