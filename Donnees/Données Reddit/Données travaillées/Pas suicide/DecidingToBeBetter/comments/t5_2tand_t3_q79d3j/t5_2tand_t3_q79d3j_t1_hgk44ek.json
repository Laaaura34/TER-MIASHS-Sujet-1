I cut off most of my toxic friends and sometimes the loneliness of daily life suffocates me. But, like you said, this whole year of loneliness has allowed me to make massive changes to my mindset, to be more self-sufficient, and so on.\n\nI don\u2019t feel happy all the time, but I\u2019m starting to feel more content every day. Things aren\u2019t great, but they\u2019re just right. I\u2019m learning to be grateful for that, even though the reality of how hard happiness is to attain and how loneliness is an inevitability for me sometimes hit me hard. We\u2019ll find our way out of this period of pain.\n\nI cut off social media. Barely talk to old acquaintances. As of now, I\u2019m finally sure that I\u2019m doing the things I want to do, not because I\u2019m comparing myself to someone\u2019s post or because I want my friends to think my life\u2019s great. It\u2019s so liberating to pursue a goal and to have 100% certainty that you are doing it because you truly want to.\n\nGreat post, I hope it helps many more.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q79d3j/the_key_to_self_improvement_is_learning_to_be/hgk44ek/"}
