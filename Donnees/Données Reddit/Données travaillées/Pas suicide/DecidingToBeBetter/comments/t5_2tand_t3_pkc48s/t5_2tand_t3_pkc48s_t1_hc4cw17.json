And there\u2019s an idea that if you give out and show fortune to others you will reap the rewards. I think that we get into states of thinking like this because we feel like our lives are not entertaining enough to express ourselves but in fact it\u2019s that thinking that stops us doing and being exactly what we want. My issues came around when my brother had a lot of success in his career and it affected me in a way of sadness that I hadn\u2019t done anything I wanted and had real conversation with friends of things I\u2019m proud of. But I\u2019ve learned to live my life how I want to and be positive with everyone I know, and I\u2019ve also been putting effort into my friends, giving them time that helps socially and vibing with theM.\n\nAnother thought that I have is that, you also sound like a creative person since you like art, and I also am entering myself into the creative world through music producer side of things which involves creating beats. This is all creative work and is very hard to see results of what we\u2019re used to and this lowers our self esteem. The one thing I would say is to focus on being what character/vibe you want, so that you can find yourself, because creative people find it easy to vibe on their own, but social anxiety comes about and is rectified through understanding to not deep everything and live like a happy creative human being. \n\nI just rambled a bunch of shit but maybe this helped in any way \nNate", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pkc48s/me_being_envious_of_literally_everyone_in_my_life/hc4cw17/"}
