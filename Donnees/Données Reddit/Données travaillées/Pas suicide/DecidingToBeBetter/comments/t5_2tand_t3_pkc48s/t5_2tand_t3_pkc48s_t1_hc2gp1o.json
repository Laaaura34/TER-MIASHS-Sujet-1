Do not hate on yourself for feeling this way. You have acknowledged how you feel, it's a great thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee, do not laugh. I am not a huge Kim Kardashian fanatic, but I do believe in the brand that she has created, that is some impressive and hard work. And in one of her episodes of the show, she said something like if she doesn't like something she is not going to sit and feel bad about it, but rather work on it. And whenever I feel bad about how i have so many unreached goals and wasted potential, i just think about what she said and how much it actually matters yk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to do things, do it. Do not wait for it to begin. I spent the whole month telling myself, I will begin working out daily from tomorrow or Monday or etc. Last week, i just got up and worked out. Like, just stick to it. Remember why you began. Create beautiful small boxed like calendar boxes and color or fill the blocks every time you do a thing daily and do something like streaks. Try not to break the streak.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust forget about people. Being envious is really taxing. Just let it go. See what freedom and lightness comes with just minding your own business.
