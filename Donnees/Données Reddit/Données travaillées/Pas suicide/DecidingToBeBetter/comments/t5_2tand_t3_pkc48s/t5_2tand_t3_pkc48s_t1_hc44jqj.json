Make a morning routine for yourself. Start light. Make your bed every morning. Then when you get used to that, make your bed and pound a bottle of water. Then those two things and stretch. SLOWLY add things to your routine. even if it's things you already do. Make a conscious effort to make it part of a routine. Create a morning routine that can be translated into small daily accomplishments. What you do in the morning sets the tone for your day.\n\nDoing this will eventually translate into you accomplishing bigger and better things. Things that you can be proud of. It'll set your sense of individuality. It'll help you gain control of your unhealthy thoughts and habits. Like I said, it won't fix your problems, but it'll give you one hell of a fighting chance. I also believe in fitness as a form of therapy, but that isn't for everyone.\n\nLastly, don't be hard on yourself. You're a teenager. You're supposed to be confused about yourself.
