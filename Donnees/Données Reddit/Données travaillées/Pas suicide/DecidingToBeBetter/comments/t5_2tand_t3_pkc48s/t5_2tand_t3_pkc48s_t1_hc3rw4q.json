You\u2019re only 18\u2013you\u2019ve got several more years before your brain is even fully developed. I know legally you\u2019re an adult, but I promise you A LOT happens in your brain and perspective from 18-25. Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. I remember being envious of others at that age. You\u2019re desperate to get into the world and be the best version of yourself but it can feel like a competition. \n\nBut self improvement and evolving as a person is not a linear or fast process. And if you do it right, you\u2019ll be growing and evolving your whole life. You\u2019re already off to a great start being this self reflective and focused on growing at 18. It takes a lot of people years to even be able to do that. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of good advice here. Just remember to be patient with yourself and know that you\u2019ll get there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pkc48s/me_being_envious_of_literally_everyone_in_my_life/hc3rw4q/"}
