I hope I can find out who I really am. It\u2019s difficult disputing what I really want and what I tell myself I want. For a long time I wanted to become a more fluent conversationalist but after I took lsd, I realized the only reason I wanted to become better was to gain admiration and acceptance, but not a genuine relationship.

I have my desires completely confused and I did set up a therapist to guide me to self realization.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/auo8jj/i_took_lsd/eh9l6sc/"}
