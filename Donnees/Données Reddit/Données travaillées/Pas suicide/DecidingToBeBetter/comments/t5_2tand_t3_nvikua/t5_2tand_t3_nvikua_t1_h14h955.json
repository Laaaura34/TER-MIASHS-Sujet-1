This may be done subconsciously, but it is there. Some feeling that you have is driving you to act in a way that you\u2019re trying to escape. Thus the \u201cread Reddit until I\u2019m numb.\u201d  So I would ask that you look at your thoughts that are driving those feelings. Become more aware of those thoughts and the feelings that are driven by those thoughts. Are they feelings you are trying to suppress?  \n\nWhen you feel the urge to go back to the internet and browse for hours, stop and recognize what you\u2019re thinking and feeling at that moment. It may take some time and may take some practice, but you will find it. From there, start thinking different thoughts which will drive different feelings. \n\nStart doing this every day: take 10-15 minutes to write down your thoughts and journal. Sounds like you do this a little bit anyway. But this should be part of the routine. From there you can start to identify various recurring thoughts that aren\u2019t serving you. \n\nYou say \u201clow self esteem\u201d but that you\u2019ve also been to open mic nights. Those seem to conflict to me. It is not easy to get in front of people and do a comedy routine, you\u2019ve done it. What\u2019s stopping you from thinking more of yourself and doing it again? Do you think those in the audience would have the same courage and guts to get up there and do what you\u2019ve done?  \n\nYou\u2019re \u201ctaking baby steps.\u201d What do you want to do(eg giant steps?)? What actions are going to get you to your result of being a comic?  Identifying those actions. From there how do you want to feel in order to perform those actions? Perhaps empowered or courageous or focused?  Then from there identify the thoughts that you want to think to generate that feeing. \u201cToday I\u2019m writing three jokes.\u201d \u201cToday I\u2019m gong to absorb the world in order to create comedy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to sign up for 2 open mics.\u201d  Just do it. \n\nIn the end, you are having thoughts that\u2019s drive some sort of feeling that drives some sort of action. Right now the action is Reddit and porn. What are the thoughts and feelings?  From there, how can you change that in order to get to your result?  What can you think, then feel, then act in order to get to your goal?  \n\nIf you have success or failure, how will you ensure yourself and get over it to keep moving forward?  You got this, just look within first, as that is where the issue is. For some people it\u2019s shopping or drugs, for you it\u2019s the internet. \n\nThis is a big goal. You can get there and you can be successful, but clean up your head first. There is so much more to discuss, feel free to reach out. \n\nGood luck, you\u2019re amazing, and I love you too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nvikua/i_know_what_want_to_do_in_life_i_have_the/h14h955/"}
