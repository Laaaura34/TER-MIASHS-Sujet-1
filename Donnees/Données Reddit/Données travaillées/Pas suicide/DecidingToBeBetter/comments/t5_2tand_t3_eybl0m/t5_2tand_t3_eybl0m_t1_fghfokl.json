We only know so much. We\u2019re told that our lives should look a certain way. But honestly, everyone feels similar to you, more or less. No one has it figured out, no one is having a fantastic time every single day. No one is sure of their future. No one is ready for change. Everything you\u2019re feeling is so widely relatable, it might help to remind yourself that it\u2019s not you vs the world. You\u2019re in the same boat as a lot of different types of people, people you wouldn\u2019t expect to relate with you, people you assumed were happy or having a good time - it\u2019s just that we\u2019re not telepathic. We can\u2019t read each other\u2019s minds. We don\u2019t live the lives of others. We don\u2019t see what people go through behind closed doors. You\u2019re not wrong or different. We\u2019re more alike than different, it may surprise you. \n\nThe future rarely looks like what we expected it to, in good ways and bad, so there\u2019s really no reason to obsess over the idea of what your future is going to look like, although I completely understand and have been there myself. Something that helps is changing up your usual routine. Do something that you wouldn\u2019t normally do, even if it\u2019s as simple as going out somewhere to get food or coffee. Just change it up. Even if it scares you. When you change up your normal routine when stuck in a pattern of negative thinking, you remind yourself how change is always possible, it\u2019s happening right in front of you. What was once going to be another typical day, has changed. Through action. You can\u2019t think your way out of this, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned. If you\u2019re more in your head than you are in your body, it\u2019s time to balance things out. Creativity, exercise/sports, hobbies, volunteering/social interaction - these are all things that help us get out of our head for the moment and into the body as we are physically doing something that requires more mental focus than the our obsessive negative thinking, and it serves as a reminder that life is more than just thinking. Our thoughts can take us somewhere else, transcend us. It can also take us to our own personal hell. Life is more than just the mind. Stopping and looking around and focusing on all the objects in the room you\u2019re in, the movement of your breathing, the feel of your skin, the noises you hear - these are all things that are with you in the moment. You can focus on these things when you find yourself drifting into a different place in your mind. Your thoughts about your future aren\u2019t real, they are valid, but they do not exist, they are an idea, and if it isn\u2019t serving you well, it\u2019s time to let that idea move on so you can move on past it. If you want to change, you can. If you believe nothing will change, nothing will. If you believe one day things will look brighter for you, they will. You have a choice in the say of your future. And that\u2019s through the actions of your present moment. You can\u2019t think your way out of this one I believe.
