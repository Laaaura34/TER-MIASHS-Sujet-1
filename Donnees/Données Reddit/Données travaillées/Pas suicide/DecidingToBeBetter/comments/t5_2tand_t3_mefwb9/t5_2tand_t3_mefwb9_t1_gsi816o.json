The same thing goes for the mental health/pop-psychology posts. It's great that we're getting more open about mental health to destigmatize it but I find that it actually makes things worse sometimes. I lessen my own experiences and if anything, further the stigma with myself, because these posts have everyone claiming they have anxiety or depression and generalize symptoms. This in turn, makes me feel like nothing is wrong and that I can't possible have mental health issues.\n\nWith both, it's very much a \"pull yourselves up by your  bootstraps\" mentality. Everyone has a different journey and we all can't just magically change something about ourselves over night.\n\nThanks for posting this though - I knew something felt off about this type of content!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mefwb9/why_motivational_selfhelp_content_might_be_making/gsi816o/"}
