Make sure you put equal effort into your professional and personal life. In college, I was so focused on school that my friendships suffered. I have everything I wanted: good paying job, nice car, dog, savings account, great credit, you name it. But I have almost no companionship to share my life with. 3 of my 6 close friends are still in state, but I only get to see them once a month or so. I always wanted to travel and see the world, I finally have the means but no one to go with. It's incredibly lonely and SO intimidating to try and make new friends now. \n\nI was in an abusive relationship all thru college and he definitely isolated me too, but I put too much effort into classes. My current partner is the polar opposite and while I love that I've been made a part of all of his friend groups, I'm still lonely. Especially seeing how much more fulfilling life could've been for me if I would've invested more time in friendships. I don't mean skip class and go to a party instead, still try your best academically, but make sure it's equal effort. And unless you care about grad school immediately after your undergrad, don't fret over your GPA. If you're going directly into the work force, jobs don't really care what it was.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1owzq/advice_youd_give_to_a_18f/h8hie8i/"}
