I change friends, college and move out for studying, come back to hometown, mental breakdowns, therapy, a couple of jobs, my body change, I lost people and a made new friends and experience. \nSo..my advice: BE LOYAL TO YOURSELF, accept yourself with the good and bad of you, maybe you change and maybe that is good or bad we don't know but u always keep in mind that u need to love yourself and no matter what, always put yourself first, and never is too late for be whatever u want to be. \nGreetings from a 29F who change so many times in my 20s so now a know what a want and most important, I know what I DON'T WANT.\nKeep it real girl.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1owzq/advice_youd_give_to_a_18f/h8h0iet/"}
