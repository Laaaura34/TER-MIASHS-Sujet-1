And I\u2019m 20 years on.\n\n- Keep doing the hobbies you love even if they aren\u2019t seen as \u201ccool\u201d, one day they probably will be anyway!\n- Don\u2019t change for anyone (unless it\u2019s for positive like personal growth or giving up something toxic)\n- Learn to cook and clean, spend time daily doing the chores; no one else wants to do it for you!\n- Don\u2019t trust people without question just because you\u2019re in love with them\n- Don\u2019t hang around for people who don\u2019t intend to commit to you\n- But also don\u2019t feel you have to commit and always have a partner! Learn to be comfortable alone \n- Put money aside and save up for a house deposit. In twenty years it will be worth it!\n- Get a pension and pay into it more than you have to\n- You don\u2019t have to do the career you are expected to do, but it might be best not to jump ship whenever things get tough\n- Same about moving house\u2026 country\u2026 could be fun but you can\u2019t escape yourself, so learn to live with yourself \n- Push yourself out of your comfort zone, it\u2019s normally where the best things happen!\n- Avoid people who are dead end and dragging you down, or doing things you\u2019re uncomfortable with\n- Physical appearance is great to look after but don\u2019t obsess with being the prettiest/hottest. That stuff won\u2019t make you happy", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1owzq/advice_youd_give_to_a_18f/h8g14ip/"}
