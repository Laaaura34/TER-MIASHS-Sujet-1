What brings you fulfillment and meaning?  Aim to do that for a career.   Or at least make that thing a priority in your life, \n2.  If something in your past is bothering you, write about it a lot and think it through until it doesn't bother you so much. \n3.  If you are worried about the future, break that down into the smallest increments you can think of and think of different ways to manage those scenarios.   A more manageable problem is a less scary one. \n4.  Read great books.   There is a mountain of knowledge out there from really intelligent people.   Don't try to reinvent the wheel.\n5.
