Have a life for yourself that doesn't make you rely on anyone. Exercise, learn to invest, do courses in your field of education. You can get cheap ones on places like coursera, Udemy or Skillshare.\n- Travel cheap. Take a train, plane, whatever you can do to go somewhere. Once you're older, you'll have a lot less time and maybe even children. \n- Learn a skill that keeps you busy. And even when it's tough, try to move forward. E.g. a language, an instrument or a sport.\n- Learn to be at peace with who you are.
