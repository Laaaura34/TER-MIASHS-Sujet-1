I'm trying to cultivate discipline in my life and optimistically would achieve that. \nThe only reason that I've not been in a relationship and don't want to be in one for a few years is that I'm still learning to be me, to be content with who I am, to work on my insecurities, to heal through past traumas or anything. I want to be my best self when I get in one so that I could give it my best. \nI'm starting a journal to write my to-dos and track my progress.\nFor meditation I'll try to do \"anulom-vilom\", a breathing technique, as a starter, hopefully, from tomorrow.\n\nThanks for putting in so much effort writing this.\ud83e\udd0d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1owzq/advice_youd_give_to_a_18f/h8gaml1/"}
