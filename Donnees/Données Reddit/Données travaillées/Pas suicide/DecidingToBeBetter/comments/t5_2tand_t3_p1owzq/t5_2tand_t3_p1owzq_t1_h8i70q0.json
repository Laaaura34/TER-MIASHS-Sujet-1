I'm 25 and had many many too many party years, it's not worth going out during the week 9/10 you'll make a fool of yourself. \n\nKnow your worth and trust that gut feeling and go with it! Don't let people take advantage of you. If you think you're in a shady place, leave. Think that a guy or girl is giving off red flags, don't bother with them. Friends that do shitty things to you? Drop them immediately, they'll do another shitty thing.\n\nIf you are interested in college, I would highly suggest talking to someone recently graduated about the financials of it all. Go to community college and get your generals, I CANT stress that enough. Yeah all your friends might be going to college and living in dorms but holy hell save your money it's not worth it. Go visit them on the weekends instead. Also take college seriously, explore your options, find something you love. I fucked around for 2 years and paid for college for 2 years that didn't even count towards anything.  7 years later I finally got it together, graduated and now I'm 70 k in debt.\n\nAnd please get on birth control. Even if you aren't having sex. Live YOUR life and allow yourself to not have that stress luming over you.\n\nNever drink and drive or get in a vehicle with a drunk driver, call an Uber or walk.\n\nLastly, you're not invincible. I lost two very very close friends in college and it has been a very sad opening experience that absolutely anything could happen. \n\nI could go on and on. These are the points that come to mind first", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1owzq/advice_youd_give_to_a_18f/h8i70q0/"}
