The human being develops completely, in every way, only around the ages of 21-22. \n> relationships matter. Invest in relationship with self and people who matter\n> it's okay to fail and make mistakes. Just know when to learn and not repeat. \n> boundaries are important\n> trust your instincts\n> everything you need is within you. \n> you matter. Know that. Believe that. \n> looks change. Fashion changes. Remember to work on your mind and intellect more than you do on external appearance \n> be kind to yourself and others\n> learn and play\n> take mental health day offs more often if you need\n\nI love you. \n\n... \n\nI'd actually write these future letters to myself.
