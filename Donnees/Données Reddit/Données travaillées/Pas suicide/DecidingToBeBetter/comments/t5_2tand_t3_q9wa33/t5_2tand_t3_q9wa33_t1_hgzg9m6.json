Enjoyed building it a great deal, so I gave my real estate clients to my then girlfriend, and earned my General Contracting license.\n\nIt was an AMAZING feeling when my first design I had for sale was framed.  Even better when it was finished and sold for a nice profit.  There's nothing like picking a path and taking the journey.  Even if you have to give up, you've learned something, and if you make it... there's no better feeling.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9wa33/how_to_get_next_level_in_life/hgzg9m6/"}
