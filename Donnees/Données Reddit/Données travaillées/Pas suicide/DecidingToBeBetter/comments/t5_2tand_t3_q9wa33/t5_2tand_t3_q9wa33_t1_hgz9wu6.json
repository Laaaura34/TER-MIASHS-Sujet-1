I don't think it's in the rules or anything, but based on posts I see on the regular it's very much a place where people with addiction/mental illness/bad living circumstances post about the W's they can get in a day.\nOtherwise I suggest that you look at your life as a whole, identify a thing that gives you most issues and work on that. Just setting stuff like sustainable living as a goal will come with plenty of stuff to work on. Researching zero waste techniques or sourcing your products and their production lines or something like it, that is gonna take a lot of time, then that comes with self sufficiency like learning how to fix tech, mend clothes, cooking from scratch. Goes well with stuff like social awareness, scientific and political literacy and so on. .", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9wa33/how_to_get_next_level_in_life/hgz9wu6/"}
