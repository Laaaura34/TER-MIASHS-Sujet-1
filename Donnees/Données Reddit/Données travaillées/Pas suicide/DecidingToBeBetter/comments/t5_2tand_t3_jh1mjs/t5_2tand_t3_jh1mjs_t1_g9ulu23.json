Make sure you document everything. Take a note pad into your HR meeting and make contemporaneous notes. If they ask what you are doing, say that you want to make sure you remember the important bits from the meeting and decided to take notes as a way of doing that.\n\nIf they ask you to stop, challenge them as to why they want you to stop. Then carry on taking the notes. \n\nIf they do fire you, you may want the notes to pass on to a lawyer for a constructive dismissal claim.\n\nThis is exactly what I did about a decade back in a sinilar situation.
