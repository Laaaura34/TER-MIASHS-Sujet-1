If your employer does take adverse action against you, report it ASAP!!! There are deadlines around reporting this kind of thing, often as little as 30 days. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, I'd suggest getting a support team together of your friends/family/etc. Let them know what is going on, and ask for support when it's possible/safe.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jh1mjs/reporting_hazardous_osha_violations_even_though_i/g9x72y6/"}
