Parents set you up with all the necessary resources to learn at a young age. My dad was also a hands-on person, and I really enjoyed spending time in the workshop, watch him work, and sometimes drill a hole or something similar (mostly he would have me hold screws or nails, or one time he asked me to sort several jars of old screws he found in the streets). I won't say I took much knowledge from him in a theoretical sense. Whatever he did was just by gut feeling or with material he had available, so an actual engineer would be horrified. His creations were not particularly good looking either, but they worked.\n\nWith that said, in my late twenties too, I am still not capable to create things myself, or to do some extensive DIY on the house. I found that the reason is I am afraid to make a mistake (e.g. when placing tiles, correcting mistakes can be expensive). The second reason is that I will not spend money on tools that I need because I am afraid to invest in this as a hobby. The final challenge is lack of ideas what to create :)\n\nIs this something your now husband can help you with?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxzpnf/looking_to_learn_handsonskills_i_feel_like_im_so/gvtb01g/"}
