I mean part of it for me is lack of sleep with a toddler, one on the way, and med issues. I'm not sure what the term is, there's 'Hangry' (which I also suffer from) but what is it for sleep...Tie-irksome?\n\nTo work on it I've tried to single out the things that are positive in my life (wife is amazing, kid is budding genius, our Goldens are better people than most people I know). Then, take the things that are irritating me and making me bitter and categorize them. Things I can change immediately, things I can change over time, and things I can't change. The 2 former items I create a plan of action for, and the latter I sincerely and utterly try to accept and move on from. Edit/Add: So for you, like why do you feel others are progressing? Do you need to find a new job? Go back to school? (I know that statement is daunting as fuck but I did it at 32 and am now 40 and 5 years into a gov't job with a pension).\n\nDepending on how you deal with things, you might be well off keeping a journal about your progress and difficulties, seeing a counselor, or at the very least having a routine amount of time to reflect on your day and how you can improve tomorrow. Your awareness of this change speaks volumes about your ability to affect new changes in the direction you want.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qctkw3/how_do_i_start_being_a_good_person_again/hhl1ghz/"}
