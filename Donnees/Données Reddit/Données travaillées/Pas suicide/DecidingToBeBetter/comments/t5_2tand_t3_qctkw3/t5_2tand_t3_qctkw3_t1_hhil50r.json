It sounds silly but just learning to pause and reflect before reacting (even when you\u2019re just reacting to sounds or feelings in your body) is the first step towards not reacting instinctively to other people. The other thing that can help is learning to be kinder to yourself. Morning pages (author Julia Cameron talks extensively about this) are a good way to process out the negative feelings first thing in the morning. The first step towards being better is making the decision so you\u2019re well on your way! And if you feel like you\u2019re getting stuck or falling behind please know you have a whole community here that wants you to be happy and successful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qctkw3/how_do_i_start_being_a_good_person_again/hhil50r/"}
