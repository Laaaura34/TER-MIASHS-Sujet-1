Its really hard to think positively of others if you're being hard on yourself. Give yourself space to be the full, imperfect, wonderful human being that you are. Get in touch with your feelings and figure out why you're feeling the way you feel, and you'll find it'll be easier to empathize with others too. \n\nAlso, finding a 3 things each day that you're grateful for, even if they're small. Focusing on what you DO have rather than what you don't will start to re-train your mind to recognize and appreciate the good things when they happen. It will feel clunky and awkward at first but I promise it works. It helps to make it a routine, like asking at dinner at the end of each day, \"what am I grateful for today?\".
