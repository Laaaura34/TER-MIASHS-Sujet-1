There\u2019s too much thoughts circulating that it\u2019s giving you the impression the world is in chaos, when in reality, nothing is really happening to you physically.  Understanding the difference between thinking and being present will give you the ability to identify when your mind starts wandering.  To reset the mind from thoughts is to focus on your senses as this is what the present moment is tied to- what you\u2019re seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, or tasting.  Anything outside of your senses is your imagination being activated.\n\nA quick trick to snap out of thoughts and to be present is to ask yourself these two questions:  Where am I?  What am I doing?  This is the practice of mindfulness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qctkw3/how_do_i_start_being_a_good_person_again/hhiuuxe/"}
