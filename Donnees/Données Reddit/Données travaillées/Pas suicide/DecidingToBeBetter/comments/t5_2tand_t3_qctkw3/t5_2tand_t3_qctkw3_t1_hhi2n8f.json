Awhile back I realized I am a shell of my old self although maybe I am more rooted in reality than I used to be. A number of years back I believed most people were good. I had a lot of patience. I rarely used swear words. I found the best in every situation. But lately have been more of a black cloud than the sunshine. I think there is an element of depression for sure. \n\nWhat I have been doing is being super intentional. I wake up every single day and tell myself it\u2019s going to be a great day. I have a note in my phone that every night before I go to sleep I list 3 good things. When a negative thought comes into my head (or out of my mouth), I acknowledge it and then follow it with what I wish I would have thought/said. I also have dove back into yoga and meditation even if it is only for a few minutes each day. \n\nAdditionally, I have avoided most social media (facebook/instagram/tiktok), I have curated my reddit to only positive things and hobbies etc. I avoid the news like the plague which I realize is somewhat privileged of me however it was negatively impacting me every day. I don\u2019t listen to much angry music or ranting podcasts. \n\nBasically just focusing on the things that bring me joy and trying to be intentional in avoiding those that don\u2019t. We really are what we think, and it can be difficult to re-train our brains. Best of luck to you, we can do this!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qctkw3/how_do_i_start_being_a_good_person_again/hhi2n8f/"}
