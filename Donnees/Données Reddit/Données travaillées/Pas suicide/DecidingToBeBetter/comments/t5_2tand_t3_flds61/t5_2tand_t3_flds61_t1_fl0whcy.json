Write down questions you have about yourself or your actions, then do your best to answer them, but really listen to yourself and dont lie to yourself. Often times I find the process will lead me to more questions.\n\n\nExample: \"Why did what he say make me so mad?\"\n\"Well, it was insulting, and it said it in front of all my friends \"\n\"Do you think being insulting was his intent? If it was, did you do something that he might have viewed as insulting? Most people don't intentionally lead with being mean\"\n\n\n I try to imagine myself as a seperate person who wants to know more about me. More often then not its very difficult to dig for the answers. It's fun but can be really scary", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/flds61/23_things_ive_learned_about_life/fl0whcy/"}
