Cheaper to buy them in bulk. \n\nProtein. Protein. Protein. \n\nWhole grain bread rather than just white or wheat. \n\nDrink water (or coffee or tea). Helps your body's natural processes and curbs appetite. \n\nAvoid sugar. Especially processed sugars. \n\nAvoid soda and alcohol. \n\nLean white meats over red meats and dark meats. \n\nTry intermittent fasting. \n\nAs much as it sucks, count calories. \n\nIf you feel like your budget is keeping you from getting a specific vitamin or nutrient, supplements are cheap and effective. \n\nEat plant. \n\nThat's all I can think of for now.
