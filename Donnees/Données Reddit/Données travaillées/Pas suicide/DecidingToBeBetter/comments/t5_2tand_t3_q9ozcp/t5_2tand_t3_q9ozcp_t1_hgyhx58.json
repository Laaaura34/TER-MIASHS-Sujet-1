If I go for a run or workout, I forget that feeling very quick and get a positive energy boost from it.. Also other forms of self improvement, maybe reading or learning a new skill are the same. \n\nAnother thing, not really answering your question, but I would have a think about new ways to meet people. It's hard to do that right now, but there are ways. For example I recently started learning a new language, and I hired a tutor for that.
