The gist of it was, an old man was unhappy about all the noise at his house. When the kettle boiled, the whistle was too loud. When a log settled in the fireplace, that was too loud. It made him very grumpy. \n\nSo a wise man said, get a chicken. He still wasn\u2019t happy, so the wise man said add a pig. Same thing\u2026 add a cat. Then add a dog. Then add a cow. Then add a horse. Then add more chickens. The noise was worse than ever! Finally the old man had enough, and sold all the animals. \n\nAhh\u2026 how quiet and soothing were the kettle and fireplace then! \n\nMoral of the story\u2026. eventually you may get roommates, and after dealing with all their BS, like the old man with the animals, you\u2019ll learn\u2026.  ahh, living alone is so nice!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9ozcp/how_to_be_alone_without_being_lonely_advice_pls/hgymbiu/"}
