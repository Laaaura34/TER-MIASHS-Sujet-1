Maybe 1-2 days of the week I do feel pretty intensely alone, and that time sucks.  But what helps is remembering to keep doing things - e.g. keep getting out and watching movies, going for walks or hiking, trying out new restaurants and such.  What helped me is realizing these are things I'd be doing anyway whether alone or not.\n\nSee if you can setup trips to meet up halfway with old friends, then plan those for the future.  Really helps me to have future trips to look forward to.\n\nSee if you can find a friend to sync up with on a regular basis.  I have a friend on the other side of the country who I sync up with and it's a real blessing.\n\nMake sure you have productive hobbies to keep you from being bored.  Some people make their lives busy in order to avoid their mind drifting into realizations of loneliness or despair in general.\n\nAlso would recommend meeting new folks locally through meetup groups or taking classes.\n\nI don't have all of this figured out myself, as I said usually it's 1-2 days of each week feeing very lonely.  But I have felt these things have helped.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9ozcp/how_to_be_alone_without_being_lonely_advice_pls/hgz7n4b/"}
