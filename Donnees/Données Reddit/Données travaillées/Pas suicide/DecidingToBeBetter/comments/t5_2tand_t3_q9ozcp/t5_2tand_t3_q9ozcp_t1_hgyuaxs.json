I'm putting emphasis on the last phrase because in my personal experience, I just simply don't want to interact everyday with a fuckton of people just to \"iMpRoVe\" myself or \"bE a bEtTeR vErSioN oF mYsElf\". People will deadass try to peer pressure you into doing that but true happiness lies in doing what YOU want to do. If you want to stay in and play video games and watch movies then it's okay. It's OKAY. \nAs for being alone without feeling lonely I would recommend picking a hobby. As simple as gaming to guitar or whatnot. Watch movies, shows etc. Other than that, start eating healthy and start working out. It doesn't matter if it's weight training or cardio or even just walking. Do any kind of exercise for an hour or maybe even two everyday. Believe me it'll lift your spirits in a heartbeat. Find new music that you like. And create playlists. \nAnd if you're like me and have body issues then chances are you're even more like me and the only reason you feel bad when you're alone is because you don't feel confident in your body. Trust me I've been through it. So if this is a problem for you then try weight lifting and cardio to be fitter and more attractive. Trust me it'll help you to be alone when you know you've done something productive everyday. I hope this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9ozcp/how_to_be_alone_without_being_lonely_advice_pls/hgyuaxs/"}
