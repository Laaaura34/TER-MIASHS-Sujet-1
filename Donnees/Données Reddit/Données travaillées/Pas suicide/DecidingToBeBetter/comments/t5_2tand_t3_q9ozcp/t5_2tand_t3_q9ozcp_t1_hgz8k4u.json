Yesterday I started the chat with saying how nice it is to finally be out and treat myself to dessert.  Then just asked how she is doing during covid and go from there.  I enjoyed talking to the bartender yesterday and had a good night of taking myself out.  So I asked her what day she normally works and told her I will probably be back just to treat myself because I had a nice night out.  She told me it would be nice to have a regular.  I\u2019ll most likely bring a book next time as well.  Sometimes I just need to get out of my apartment lol", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9ozcp/how_to_be_alone_without_being_lonely_advice_pls/hgz8k4u/"}
