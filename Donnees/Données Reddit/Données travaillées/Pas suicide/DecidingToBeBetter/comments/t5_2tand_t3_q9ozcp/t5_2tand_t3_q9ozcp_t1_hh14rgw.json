It\u2019s not the day-to-day, I enjoy my company and I\u2019m always fine. It\u2019s the holidays that are the hardest. New year\u2019s, 4th of July, and some local events/festivals. Those are the times I wish I had just somebody, even one person that I could celebrate with. But I just tell myself, those are just one day. Sure I miss out on some fun, but it\u2019s one day, and it\u2019ll pass.
