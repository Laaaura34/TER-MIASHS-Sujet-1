I've concluded that for the average guy in 2021, dating apps are at their best when they're deleted. They're more likely to lower your self-esteem than find you someone worthwhile. Loneliness sucks but maybe pursue social hobbies that let you get to know people the real way.\n\nReddit is also an attention eater. You're caught in it because you see it as useful. It can be useful, but it still needs boundaries. We need to stop seeing idle moments as something to escape at all costs.\n\nVideo games can be good but also bad. How are you using them? To wind down after a worthwhile day? Probably good. To habitually escape your emptiness? Probably bad. I'm still willing to play games but have just recently uninstalled two that I made habit forming. Hint: these are often online multiplayer games. That said, I'm also using online multiplayer games to find new friends in. Just a matter of picking the right games and playing responsibly.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lqd8er/goodbye_i_deleted_all_my_dating_apps_i/goh3vfz/"}
