I deleted all dating apps and social media, reddit is the only one I have left. I probably won\u2019t delete it because it\u2019s a good resource for a lot of things, just need to change how I use it. I\u2019m still working on that one, but I\u2019ve started by not going to r/all, and by keeping a curated list of favorite subreddits on my front page. \n\nAlso I\u2019ve replaced videogames with working out, and it feels great to be in good shape. You sound young so it\u2019s good that you\u2019ve figured out there\u2019s more to life than wasting it on videogames. I\u2019m in my mid-30\u2019s so have a lot of catching up to do in my career. Mistakes were made. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with playing videogames, but they\u2019re a huge time-sink so if you have any aspirations for personal development you need to modify your engagement with them. Personally I\u2019m just not finding the time for games at all, and frankly I don\u2019t even miss it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lqd8er/goodbye_i_deleted_all_my_dating_apps_i/goin1io/"}
