And the FIRST thing you need to do: wake up early, and keep waking up early. Don\u2019t think  you wake up after one day and suddenly fix everything within 24 hours, self-improvement takes time. So just get up early, shower when you feel you can and when you realise ur getting to absorbed with useless things just switch those things off without thinking. Don\u2019t say \u201cfive more mins\u201d \u201c30 more mins\u201d ill start work in 2 hours from now is a promise to urself so do that, it gives u comfortable room to do what u wanna do within that two hour period.
