Depression and anxiety can often look like \"laziness\". If you start by trying to treat the depression, you may find your motivation increases and the laziness is no longer there. For me, it's a combination of therapy, medication and some exercise. I too, thought I was a lazy person until I was diagnosed. I have learned depression and anxiety zap my motivation and ambition, but if I try to stay somewhat balanced (sleep is important too) I can handle stress better. Take it easy on yourself and start with baby steps. I hope you feel better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxpczd/mental_health_physical_is_a_wreck/heqwe0b/"}
