We were using the sun to melt everything from gummy bears to coins. The whole time, he was being mean and insulting me. I was doing it wrong. My glasses were women's glasses. I wasn't fast enough.\n\nLater, when we watched the video of our experiments, he heard himself abusing me. Right away, he said \"Wow, I'm really mean to you. I love you dad.\"\n\nI swear to God he has never back talked or insulted me ever since.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxjxery/"}
