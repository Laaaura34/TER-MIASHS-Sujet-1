It might help both them and you a lot. Think Bucky in TF&TWS show, Sam tells him instead of trying to make himself feel better, he should try to make the people he hurt feel better, and that's what will truly help Bucky feel better too. Apologies and acknowledgement of causing hurt can go a long way.\n\n\"Sam: You up for a little tough love? You want to climb out of the hell you're in, do the work. Do it.\nBucky: I've been making amends.\nSam: Nah. You weren't amending; you were avenging. You were stopping all the wrongdoers you enabled as the Winter Soldier because you thought it would bring you closure. You go to these people and say sorry because you think it'll make you feel better, right? But you gotta make them feel better. You gotta go to them and be of service. I'm sure there's at least one person in that book who needs closure about something, and you're the only person who can give it to 'em.\"\n\nI applaud the work you're doing to make a change, and we're rooting for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxi5ztq/"}
