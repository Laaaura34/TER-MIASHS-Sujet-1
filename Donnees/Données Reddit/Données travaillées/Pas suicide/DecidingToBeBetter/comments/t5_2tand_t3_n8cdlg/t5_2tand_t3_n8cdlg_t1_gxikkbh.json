I had two long term relationships that had me writing things down my partner did. Good and bad. Both partners read my journal (without permission) and both of them were completely unaware of how mean they could be. One said \"how can you even love me?\" And the other asked \"did I really say all this?\" But for her it didn't count because she only remembered a few things. I wonder how this comes about? I wonder if you could find a counselor to help you discover why this was your reaction to the people around you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxikkbh/"}
