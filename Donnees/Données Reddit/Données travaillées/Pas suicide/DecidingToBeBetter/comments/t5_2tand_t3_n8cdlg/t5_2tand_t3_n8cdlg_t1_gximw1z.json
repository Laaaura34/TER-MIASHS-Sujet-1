Fess up, explain how embarrassed you were at seeing your actions. Tell them you've grown and you want to do and be better, ask them to hold you accountable and keep working on being the best version of yourself. \n\nI went through this too, I reached out to people and the response was always positive. Sometimes you are wrong and it takes a big person to admit it and people tend to respect that. This action opens the door for real healing and opportunity to create something beautiful. \n\nGood luck OP.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gximw1z/"}
