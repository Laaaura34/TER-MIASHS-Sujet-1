I (F33) can totally relate to your story. I'm a single child and I don't have many friends. I always excused it for living and travelling in foreign countries hence drifting apart from high school and college friends. I don't have videos of myself but I do have flashbacks. Being mean definitely comes easy for me aswell. I've always been proud of my snarky sarcastic answers but truth is I'm just an ahole. I'm working on myself and trying to become a better person. Would you like a penpal from Europe?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxirp3j/"}
