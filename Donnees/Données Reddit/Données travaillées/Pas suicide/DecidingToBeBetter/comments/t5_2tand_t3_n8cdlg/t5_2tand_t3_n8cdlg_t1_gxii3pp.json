And as I skimmed the comments, I see that others agree.\n\nI just wanted to say one thing from the perspective of a person who got hurt by a family member's behavior in the past. When you go to apologize to your siblings or friends, make sure that it comes from a place where you expect nothing in return. You are just there to acknowledge that you caused pain and to show that you are sorry and willing to amend things. An apology is not going to change everything overnight. You're most likely going to have to actively prove yourself for some time before your siblings are able to trust you. If there's even a hint of you being like \"so we good now?\" in your apology, it will not land, I can guarantee it. As a matter of fact, you should never be like \"ugh but i already apologized for that!!!\" even long after the apology. That will just make it worse.\n\nThat being said, that apology will be a big first step as it will show your loved ones that you have humility to admit to a wrongdoing and if they love you enough, I'm sure they they will give you the benefit of the doubt. \n\nHaving this realization is also good for future relationships that you will build with people around you. I'm sure it will help create meaningful friendships with people you might have not even met yet :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxii3pp/"}
