She had this very outgoing, funny persona that I (and many of our friends) gravitated towards. She was always very sarcastic and mean as a joke, and even prided herself on being the blunt fiend. However over the years my friends and I found ourselves uneasy around her. And I realized that what was just \u201cjoking\u201d or \u201cbeing honest\u201d to her felt like downright cruelty to us. We tried telling her several times, but she didn\u2019t seem to comprehend the level of damage she\u2019d done to the friendships. Had to distance myself from her because it took such a hit on my self esteem. To her, she was just messing around, and I genuinely don\u2019t think she meant any harm. But that doesn\u2019t make it less hurtful. It\u2019s funny and entertaining in group settings or on TV, but it\u2019s not a good way to form deep, loving friendships.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxkt26u/"}
