Looking back now, you see that's not the case. However I've noticed you describe your current self as:\n\n>\"I've always felt that I was super relatable and down to earth, I'd even go so far to say that I'm pretty funny.\"\n\nSo you still have the same definition of \"funny\" as you did back then.\n\nThat means you're still the same person.\n\nYou need to change your definition of funny. Acting tough and finding fault in others for a laugh, has never ever been funny by anyone's standards. \n\nYour compass of what's funny and what's not, cannot be trusted. Perhaps stop trying to be funny and give up on trying to be the funny one, and aim to be the one that defends others, makes excuses for others, empathises with others. Life's not all about being the funny one. Truly funny people don't perceive themselves as funny, hope you know that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxisok0/"}
