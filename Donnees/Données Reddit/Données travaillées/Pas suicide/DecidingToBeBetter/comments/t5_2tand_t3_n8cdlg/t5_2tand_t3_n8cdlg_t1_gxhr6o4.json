So... yeah, I'm kinda in your shoes, but the difference being, people haven't even apologized to me, but they're just kinda started to improve and hope that it just improves and we forget the bad stuff that's happened before.\n\nAnd, like you, I still have a hard time really absorbing that. Are they even sorry? If they say they're sorry and regret it, do they really mean it? It's really hard to dissociate what you've always come to know and what people claim they now are.\n\nSorry for the long response and also made it about me there, haha, but yeah, I feel for you and I hope for the best for you.
