Allow me to explain.\n\nStory time...My older brother (4 years older) is a textbook narcissist, and in every home video he tears me down and laughs afterwards. When I was 9 to 12 years old, our dad was dying of cancer. While filming home movies on birthdays/holidays my brother still mercilesly mocked how our dad looked while undergoing chemo by calling him \"fat Gollum.\" He'd say constantly how \"hideous\" I was at 10 years old, and how \"stupid\" our mom was.\n\nI bring this up, because he still does this to this day. He's 32 now. He's a grown ass man who is still a raging narcissist and has **never** felt remorse for his actions or words. Even after our father died. To this day, every time my mother and I speak with him, he says things that are just as bad, if not worse that what was said when he was young. \n\n***You are different because you're feeling remorse and want to be better. Even with your past, you're miles above where my brother (and other true assholes) will ever be.*** Something else that separates you from true narcissists is that you know you were wrong. Narcissists assume they're never wrong and they're just \"being honest.\" (I.e. our already self-conscious father who was literally dying \"needed\" to be told that he looks terrible. \ud83e\udd2c) I've had my fair share of narcissists/sociopaths/bullies in my life, and you don't sound like one to me.
