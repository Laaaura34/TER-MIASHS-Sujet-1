In Seinfeld, George comes to the realization that everything he has done up to that point was wrong. He chose to start doing the opposite and his world changed. I've started looking at life the same way I look at a diet. How your body looks and feels is a direct consequence of how and what you eat (in most cases). This is also why \"going on a diet\" only yields temporary results. You might lose some weight and decide you can finally go back to eating how you want to, but most people don't consider that their previous diet caused obesity and lethargy and going back to that will undo the progress made with the new diet leading to a healthier body and life. My advice, if you can call it that, is to try things that may work for you and continue executing until you see results. If you aren't getting the kind of results you want, try something else. I personally enjoy reading \"success stories\" from business founders and the like to see what pieces of their background I can emulate or implement into my life. The result so far has been doubling my income, buying a home for myself, starting a side business, making new friends, dating someone great, and making overall progress to the life I want. I had intended to be a millionaire by 30, but that isn't likely to happen. If my life simply continues on this trajectory, I will achieve my goals even if it is at a slower rate than I wanted. And I will look for opportunities to accelerate my growth moving forward.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os25f7/how_do_i_go_about_reinventing_and_changing_my/h6lqcbn/"}
