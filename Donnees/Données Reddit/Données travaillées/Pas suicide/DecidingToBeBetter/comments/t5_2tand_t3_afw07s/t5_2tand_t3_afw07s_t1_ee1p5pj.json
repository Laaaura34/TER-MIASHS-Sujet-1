When you get something other than glowing/5 star reviews, it\u2019s not about what happened *it\u2019s about how you handle it from here on out.*\n\n- if it\u2019s a mistake you made, own it 100%.\n- if it\u2019s a miscommunication, start communicating clearly right now. \n- if it\u2019s something you were depending on someone else for, don\u2019t throw them under the bus. Work on *your* time and people management. \n\nEveryone wants to be perfect. Nobody is. Accept this is a great learning opportunity and own whatever the outcome is.\n\nI\u2019m a manager at a company. If someone makes a mistake, I usually do not actually give a shit about the mistake. It\u2019s about realizing \u201coh we made a mistake\u201d and *fixing it* as quickly as possible. The faster I know there\u2019s a problem, the faster I can fix it, and that\u2019s what I really want. \n\nThe people who excel at this are looked upon as very mature and trustworthy. Those who fail here don\u2019t look good, and there\u2019s no reason to be that person. \n\nWork on it!
