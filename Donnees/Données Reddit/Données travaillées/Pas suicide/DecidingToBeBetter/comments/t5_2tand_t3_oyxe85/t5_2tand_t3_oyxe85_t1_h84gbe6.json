Ex: lose weight, exercise 1 hour more a week\n\nspend time in nature, walk\n\nreading self-help book/blogs/Youtube\n\nvisiting websites for mental health like SAMHSA and NAMI, because they'll talk about topics like self-compassion and you can hear people's stories with eating disorder, imposter syndrome, depression/anxiety, loneliness, etc.\n\nstudy fashion and organize closet. You can look good no matter what height and weight. It's about the fit and coordinating. Also accessories. Models give unrealistic expectations. They are 5'10\" while average girl could be 5'4\". Many are underweight.\n\nless time on social media and cut out fake friends.\n\nYou can do this!!!!! You are beautiful and wonderful. You will find those who love you for who you are. Your past will make you stronger, so keep your head up high!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oyxe85/will_i_ever_be_enough/h84gbe6/"}
