What is the difference, between playing a good game, reading some good book or watching good movie?  \nAs far as you are not addicted, It\u00b4s perfectly ok to play games.  \nIf you are somehow addicted, you have a problem, but that is not linked with games at all, you can be addicted to almost anything.  \n  \nSo no, quick workout instead of video games will not make you happy for lifetime. It will make you happy only if that\u00b4s your goal.  \n  \nFor example, I would be really pissed of, if I would discover in my 50\u00b4s, that I missed all of those awesome games and I will never have chance in my life, to play them.\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2z7eta/the_easy_way_is_so_much_more_difficult_than_the/cpghm0l/"}
