Games are way more addictive in and of themselves and demand prolonged attention. They're almost *too* engaging, and they're unapologetically escapist.\n\nYou can read a book on a beach or while you travel. Even the longest movie is a pittance in time compared to how long the average game takes to complete. Games don't make you want to get up and do something, they make you want more of whatever carrot-on-a-stick they're offering.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2z7eta/the_easy_way_is_so_much_more_difficult_than_the/cpgmpdb/"}
