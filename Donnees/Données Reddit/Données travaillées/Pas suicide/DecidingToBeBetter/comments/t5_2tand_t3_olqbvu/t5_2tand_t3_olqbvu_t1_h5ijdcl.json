I was supposed to graduate this year, but because of horrible mental health, I\u2019m gonna need another year to get all my credits. In the meantime, I wanna study for a GED and get a part-time job.\n\n\nI\u2019m struggling to keep up with my hobbies since I keep getting into new things and never stick with them. The only one that stuck was figure skating, but lockdowns aren\u2019t helping :( and even while skating, I take so many breaks because I get distracted by my phone, which I definitely addicted to (17 hours per day sheesh)\n\nAnyway, this definitely motivated me! Especially with that last line. Yes, I may have wasted years of my life, but there\u2019s nothing I can do about it now. I need to move forward (and delete my video games) and set small goals and crush them! \n\n\nThank you Cherry/Levi Ackerman\ud83d\ude02", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/olqbvu/im_a_teenager_with_crohns_and_i_want_to_motivate/h5ijdcl/"}
