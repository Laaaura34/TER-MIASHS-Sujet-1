I too suffer from various digestive issues and am still recovering from a health crisis that struck me 3 years ago. I've had to take time off from school and was only able to return when the pandemic moved my courses online (how bitter-sweet). Life for me right now is unfulfilling; I get quite depressed thinking about how lively I once was vs. how much \"older\" I've suddenly become due to my problems. So here I am, looking for motivation to take back control of my life, and I think this post might be it :) You're a great inspirer, and I'm glad you've been making progress with your own struggles. Keep it up!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/olqbvu/im_a_teenager_with_crohns_and_i_want_to_motivate/h5lllab/"}
