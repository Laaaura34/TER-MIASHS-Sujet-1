Which is a good change, as everything started to take such a toll on me. I lost my appetite, hair started breaking off, under eye bags for days and i had zero energy.\nI suppose it is hard not to panic, I'm in my early 30's and time just seems to be passing by so fast nowadays. \n\nNot sure if therapy is helping yet, but i might also start meditating when i get the time too, hopefully that will help clear my mind and my creative ideas will come back.\n\nI really appreciate your kind feedback D-Wellers.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7m2kf/how_can_i_rediscover_myself/grcr2ve/"}
