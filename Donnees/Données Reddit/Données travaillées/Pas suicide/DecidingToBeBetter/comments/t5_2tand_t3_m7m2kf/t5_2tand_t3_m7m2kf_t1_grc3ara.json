You will get through this phase, you will be OK, and you are already doing the right things (therapy support, healthy eating, drinking plenty of water, activity)\n\nLife does throw us some curved balls that make it tough, but us humans are actually a very tough and resilient breed.\n\nIt sounds like you are being a bit tough on yourself. Be kind to yourself as much as you can. You're a single mum, raising 2 children. That is not an easy thing to do. You're doing fab and should definitely give yourself credit for that.\n\nYoure facing down your own mental health demons and yet you're still raising your kids and pushing back on that negativity. That takes immense strength and courage which I bet you didn't realise you had!\n\nYou don't have to have all the answers straight away, trust that given time and a more relaxed mind, they will come. Take that pressure off yourself. Your path will become clearer when you can remove the pressure to have all answers.\n\nNot sure you realise it but you're actually already well and truly on the road to rediscover yourself...healthy eating, drinking, and being active. Keep those things going and they will form the basis for your return.\n\nOnce you've established the eating and activity a bit more, start small, just set aside a little time to yourself to draw again, but if it doesn't happen, don't worry, try again another day.\n\nAlways be kind to yourself. Youve got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7m2kf/how_can_i_rediscover_myself/grc3ara/"}
