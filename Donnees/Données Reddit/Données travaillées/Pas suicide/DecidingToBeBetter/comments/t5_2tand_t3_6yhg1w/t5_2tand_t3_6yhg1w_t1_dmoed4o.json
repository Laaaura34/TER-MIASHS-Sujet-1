Don't go after being happy or being fulfilled but rather set a goal for yourself, no matter how big or small, and obtain it. And then set another goal. And repeat. You will feel better. It can be something simple like clean your room. And if that is too daunting, clean a part of your room. And if that still is too daunting, pick up one piece of trash and throw it out. Something like that.\n\nEventually after doing this for some time you will feel like taking on a bigger task, and even if you don't, try it anyway. If you tackle a larger task or problem then the ones you've been facing, the ones you've been facing will seem smaller even if you fail. And so on and so forth.\n\nThe point is to progress forward. Rest is important as well. But if you push yourself past where you think your limits are you might find that you don't need as much of it as you thought.\n\nI could ramble on some more but hopefully you get the point. Progress js progress.
