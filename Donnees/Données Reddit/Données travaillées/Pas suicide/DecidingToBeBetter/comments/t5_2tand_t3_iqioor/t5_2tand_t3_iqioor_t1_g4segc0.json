It\u2019s not entirely the same, but I\u2019m having this issue with art. I find if I just so much as doodle now and again on my tablet, sometimes I find a flow and make something. Some times it\u2019s not even a great thing, not even a good thing I\u2019ve drawn, but I like to save it anyway, just to prove to myself that I can do it.\n\nI wonder if the same could be done for music? Maybe hum a little, write it down, maybe it\u2019ll flourish into a little tune. I used to do that in high school while learning instruments and vocals! hang in there, I\u2019d love to hear your art, buddy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iqioor/i_dont_find_joy_in_my_hobbies_anymore/g4segc0/"}
