The most important things for you to change will also likely be the most painful to admit to yourself. Many people end up pushing away exactly the most obvious, necessary changes to their lives *precisely* because making those changes would amount to admitting to a painful truth about themselves. They simply will not make progress until they've accepted where they currently are.\n\nImagine, for a second, a faulty robot. How can the robot know how to fix itself if it does not understand the ways in which it is faulty? Sure, it could try to work towards known positive goals without really figuring out why it is struggling, but what if it turns out that one of its faults is in perceiving its own progress?\n\nIt's really the same thing. Have confidence in your humanity and worth, in the knowledge that all humans are faulty, and that by accepting your particular faults and learning how to heal or mitigate them, you are doing exactly the most admirable thing a human can do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4mi00t/can_selfacceptance_ever_be_a_component_of/d3vpqqr/"}
