Here\u2019s another one I can relate to\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s an app called Freedom. I use it every day. I can access the internet at specific times and the rest of the time I can\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s like everything else we give up. (2nd no coffee day btw and I\u2019m feeling good). Yesterday I thought about having a coffee about fifty times but then I remembered, oh no, I can\u2019t (because I\u2018ve given everything away)\n\nWhen I first started using freedom I picked up my phone a hundred times and day and thought, oh no, I can\u2019t. I HAD to find something else to do. \n\nEvery single one of these addictions/bad habits are deflections so we avoid having to break out of our comfort zone. We stay in situations that we know are not good for us and that we don\u2019t even enjoy because without them we would have to a) get off our ass. b) be present (god forbid). \n\nAddictions/bad habits are what I have done all my life to avoid being with myself. To avoid taking action. Every day I gave my power away. So, yes, I understand. \n\nIf I\u2019d had my coffee machine set up yesterday I would have had a coffee. No question. It wasn\u2019t there so it made it easier. For people like me (and maybe you) we need to take stuff away. Like you, I once considered leaving my laptop in the boot of my car a mile away. Ffs. Now I just use the app. Without it I\u2019d be doing the same as you right now. \n\nAll the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwfh8w/i_want_to_ditch_my_youtube_addiction_but_i_dont/hemh4fi/"}
