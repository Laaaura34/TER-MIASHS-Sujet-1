Regardless I think it's worth looking into r/adhd or the like for tips. \n\nMy partner has largely unmanaged ADHD and likes to have YouTube playing while reading and somehow knows whats going on on both screens. That kind of thing stresses me out to do and i can't focus if i try, but he prefers to have multiple things on to help with focus.\n\nSorry if that's a bit personal, idk how people feel about it, but my partner has done much better since reading up on how others deal and manage themselves to set themselves up for success. Everything from diet to lighting to bedtimes have a big impact", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwfh8w/i_want_to_ditch_my_youtube_addiction_but_i_dont/heguql0/"}
