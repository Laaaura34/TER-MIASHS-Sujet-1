When it comes down to it I don't have the people skills past social skills. \n\nRecently a friend told me that she broke up with her fiance and I had no idea how to react apart from generic condolences. It's like my brain just couldn't make that leap into empathy - I knew it was a bad thing but I couldn't feel any part of her emotions at all. \n\nI think I'm selfish and also I'm scared to invest in people. It's like you said, I want them to need me and, to be honest I don't want to need them, but that's unhealthy for me and unfair for them. \n\nBut how do I develop actual useful people skills when I can't get past the socialising part? I feel like that's the furtherest I get, doing shots and playing drinking games, and all my people skills stop there.\n\nAlso I'm not sure of how do deal with the pain of caring about someone though and having them not reciprocate or drift away? Most of my friends drift away or put me in the background when they're dating/ in a relationship and I get bitter and then want to be the person in that position.\n\nFuuuck as I write this out I'm realising the issues aren't with how people perceive me but how I treat others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/85n22q/i_cant_seem_to_make_any_sort_of_connection_with/dvyvmvn/"}
