When I say I don't think it takes something special what I mean is that you don't need to be Hugh Jackman to be wanted: anyone can find a relationship and it helps if, like you said, they're genuine in their emotions towards others and themselves. \n\nBut with that said, it is a mystery to me how relationships start.\n\nWhen I was younger I went on a lot of dates (that led nowhere) for the wrong reasons. At the moment, there hasn't been a person that I'm super interested in. I think I am projecting my hopes onto people and then disappointing myself before really putting myself out there.\n\nI don't think I have the skills to be vulnerable but I feel vulnerable a lot so I'm not really sure. I think understanding the conflict between feeling and expressing would help so thank you for the book recommendations. \n\n\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/85n22q/i_cant_seem_to_make_any_sort_of_connection_with/dvysakg/"}
