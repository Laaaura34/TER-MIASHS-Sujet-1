You gotta want to share you\u2019re life. When you think about the dates you\u2019ve been on, try and reflect: \n\nDid you really try to learn about the other person?\n\nWhen you shared about yourself, were you honest? Were you sincere? Was everything a joke? Did you talk about anything of substance?\n\nWhen was the last time you put yourself out there? Not just put yourself in a position where you would be open to a relationship forming, but legitimately put yourself out there? \n\n/u/mobydog has a legitimate point.\n\nMy sister experiences a lot of what you are sharing. We had a pretty different childhood from what you would consider normal, so I get it, it\u2019s tough.\n\nNext time you go out with someone, be it romantic or otherwise: ask them something personal, share something personal, it might sound dumb, but my experience has been this: people respond well to actual human emotion. Doubt is cool, curiosity is cool, insecurity is cool, as long as you are legitimately interested in someone - in getting to know someone - they will respond. \n\nGranted it requires a more in depth chill out session other than the frequent friendliness of an acquaintance.
