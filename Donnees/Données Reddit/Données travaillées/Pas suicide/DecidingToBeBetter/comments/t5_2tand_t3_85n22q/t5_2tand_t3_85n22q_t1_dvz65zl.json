You have to be open with someone. You want a deep friendship? That's where you and another person rally back and forth, taking turns being vulnerable and open and compassionate together. If you're not living as your honest self, hiding emotion problems, pretending there's composure and there's more under the surface, it's not going to work. You're too busy protecting yourself to really reach out. So for both of your sakes, you should work on getting to know yourself better.\n\nI hope this too sounds compassionate and open, because I'm saying this from the perspective of someone who tried to make it work with someone who would say some of the things you've put in your post. It seems like you're going through the motions of a relationship without any of the emotional work. Someone like you was a drain on me for many years, and he'll keep being miserable no matter who is around. So I say this because everyone should love deeply, and be deeply loved by friends and family, with many nurturing and complex relationships. \n\nIn any case, there's never anything wrong with trying to be more open and honest.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/85n22q/i_cant_seem_to_make_any_sort_of_connection_with/dvz65zl/"}
