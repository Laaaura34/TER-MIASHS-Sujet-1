I have convinced myself that I just havent met the person that \"needs\" me in that way. Its mainly you overthinking it, and that leads to feeling disconnected from those around you. I honestly don't know how to fix this, but if you figure something out let a brother know. In the meantime, pm me if you wanna talk about this kind of stuff.
