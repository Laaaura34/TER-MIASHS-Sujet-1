Going on parties friday night doesn't do that. In my experience, you need to make a connection with people beyond randomly meeting at public places or events. \n\nInstead of going to parties (which is good for meeting someone for the first time, but not so good for bonding), try asking people to spend time with you on various activities. That really depends on your interests, but some examples include doing sports, board games, going to a concert, play a video game *together*, all the other things. This helps with making friends as well as finding a partner. Figure out what is exciting for both of you, or just google around for ideas, and then invite them to do something *with you*, not something where you randomly happen to be one of the 50 people around.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/85n22q/i_cant_seem_to_make_any_sort_of_connection_with/dvzj85j/"}
