If you start seeing what is wrong then you can start looking for answers and ways of dealing with with it. You knew there was something wrong, you talked to us here openly about it and you received the replies with an open mind to the point it made you realize of things you had not realized of before. \n\nSo this works, as starter, but the real work starts now, and depends on you. You have to make your homework.\n\nConsider therapy, and reading on how to develop empathy. Get out of your comfort zone and own your errors from the past without chaining yourself to them. \n\nStart opening up to the risk of feeling pain and getting people not acting as you expected. You will get disappointed in many occasions but will be satisfying in those that the people give you back or even surpass your expectations.
