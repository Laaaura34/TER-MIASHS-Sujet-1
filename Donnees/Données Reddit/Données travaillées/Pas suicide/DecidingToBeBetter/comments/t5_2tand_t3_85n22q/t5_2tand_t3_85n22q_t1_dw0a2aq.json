You're just complaining, 'I'm perfect yet people don't want to marry me after meeting once'. You're putting the idea of a relationship on a perverted pedestal instead of treating people like human beings and putting effort into getting to know them. \n\nYou have to be willing to give invest without being cynical, but cynicism dominates your perspective. A relationship is **not** a way for you to get affection, it's teamwork and two people making each other better. It sounds like what you really want is people to give you validation because of your fragile ego (like how your points make it sound like you think you are special and somehow deserve to be given something, when in reality those things are not directly unusual or remarkable). \n\nIt's hard to give advice when the issue is ego related, but that definitely seems like something you need to work on and fix.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/85n22q/i_cant_seem_to_make_any_sort_of_connection_with/dw0a2aq/"}
