I do think I'm special, and I know that's incorrect, but I would be lying if I said otherwise. That doesn't mean I'm a psychopath though and I think everyone is like that they just don't admit it.\n\nRelationships often form on dependency; people are generally selfish; people always seek validation and approval; and people don't always value relationships based on 'teamwork' potential. My post is super self-righteous because I was trying to find evidence of being likeable (as tragic as that sounds), but again I'm not some egomaniac thinking I deserve attention simply because I'm me. I'm highlighting a very specific part of my life - the expectation and disappointment part in regards to emotional connection - but my personality isn't wholly this narrow examination.\n\nI put a lot of effort into people. And yeah I get expecting something in return is a bad motive, but I'm not like aggressively demanding reciprocation I'm hoping. \n\nYou raise valid points which I want to work on and improve, but I just want to say that any person is more complex than just cynicism and narcissism. I'm not devoid of morals and ethics and common decency and so yeah I do think I could be less selfish but again I'm not a psychopath.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/85n22q/i_cant_seem_to_make_any_sort_of_connection_with/dw0ejyy/"}
