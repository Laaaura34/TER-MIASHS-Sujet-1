Spending time together in the good times is easy, but what fosters trust and deep connection is being there in the troubles. It takes generosity, giving without expectation. \n\nIf you want to be needed you are going to be disappointed very fast. That's not a healthy dynamic. Maybe nobody needs you because you don't need anybody either. And that's OK, but I would consider it a symptom of or a result of the distance you may keep with people. Call it distance or lack of investment as described before. Have you been there in their breakups, have you helped them when they needed, have you been checking how they are doing and show that you care?\n\nEvaluate if that's you already or if you actually don't need anyone too. Then act accordingl to what you want and who you want in your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/85n22q/i_cant_seem_to_make_any_sort_of_connection_with/dvyu9si/"}
