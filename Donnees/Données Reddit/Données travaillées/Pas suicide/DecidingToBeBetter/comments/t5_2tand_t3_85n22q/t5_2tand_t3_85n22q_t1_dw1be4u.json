From experience, one of the most debilitating things in that zone (thinking of loneliness) is excessively thinking about \u201cme\u201d and exaggerating the meaning \u201cfor me\u201d of things that happen (negative but also positive). In other words it puts me in a state where my primary thought process is on assessing whether these things make me feel good or not, but what these interactions mean to me is way overblown. In short, I am thinking way too much about myself. \n\nIf I turn it around and think less about what I am trying to get from social interactions and relationships, and focus more on trying to make others \u201cfeel good\u201d through my interaction with them, I start enjoying it more and they start liking me more. I focus more on what I have to give. I start small, less with friendship/relationships and more micro interaction. \u201cThat\u2019s so interesting/cool that you X... tell me more.\u201d I try to think of and ask questions that demonstrate I have really heard what they said. I cater to their needs \u201chey your water\u2019s empty and I\u2019m heading to the kitchen. Can I fill that up for you?\u201d Even with boring people I try my best to find something to take and show interest in. It becomes enjoyable and second-nature after a while. \n\nNot saying this applies to your case. But sharing just in case something might click and help. \n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/85n22q/i_cant_seem_to_make_any_sort_of_connection_with/dw1be4u/"}
