I\u2019ve gone through high school and now my first year of college watching everyone forge these awesome relationships. I was and am surrounded by groups of the very best friends and seemingly amazing romantic relationships, but I\u2019ve never been a part of it. Sure, I had tons of friends in high school and I still have some decent friends now, but I feel like I have nothing meaningful. I\u2019m always the first one out in my circle of friends. \n\nI\u2019ve battled depression for ages, and I think this loneliness, this lack of meaning, has played a huge role in fueling my depression. When everything else is going right, I still can\u2019t feel completely happy because I lack what I crave most: a personal, meaningful relationship.  I\u2019ve learned to live with it for now. It\u2019s just the way things are; I try to tell myself that I haven\u2019t met my people yet. When I\u2019ve met them, I\u2019ll know, and until then, I\u2019m just doing my best. \n\nHang in there buddy. If you ever want to talk you can PM me. We\u2019re in a similar boat.
