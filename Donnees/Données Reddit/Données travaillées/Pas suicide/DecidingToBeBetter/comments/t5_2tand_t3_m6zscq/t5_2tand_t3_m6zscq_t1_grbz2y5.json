I never can figure out what is and isn\u2019t acceptable in terms of self-promotion on here so I like to just offer it when people comment if I feel called to do it. But it shares a lot of my journey and tools I\u2019ve used to get here and a lot of people ask me how I do or to expand and the podcast is definitely the best way to hear more about it! It\u2019s called Everyday Perspectives + is a blend of self-improvement, my spiritual journey, + realizations / experiences that lead me to go from a victim mindset into one thats empowered & understanding I am the creator of my experience. I discuss the perspective shifts & tools that help me each day. It\u2019s available on all podcast platforms + I\u2019ll message the link as reddit it might remove the comment lol. Thanks for your support again!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m6zscq/just_because_you_dont_know_where_youre_going/grbz2y5/"}
