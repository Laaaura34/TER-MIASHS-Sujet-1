I've sort of been on a journey of finding myself since my mum passed away 6.5 years ago and I was hospitalised for 2 months and nearly died 5.8 years ago\n\nI didn't think I'd make it after both events, but I'm glad I did since I got to meet some incredible friends, get a part time job, join scouts, go hiking and camping, go through my GCSEs, AS Levels, BTEC and start Uni, go to my first conventions and so much more. Looking back, I'm so thankful for my past self for getting through so many tough times. I wish I could go back and tell my younger self \"You've got this!\", \"You've gone through so much - be proud of yourself\", etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m6zscq/just_because_you_dont_know_where_youre_going/graf5mw/"}
