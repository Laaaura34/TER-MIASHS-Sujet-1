You find it false, untrue, or unhelpful. That's fine, that's why we're blessed with so many different teachers and thinkers that help us get to where we're going. \n\nWhat's troublesome is that the bulk of what you wrote are just judgements that you cast without backing any of it up. For example you wrote \"The initial post is just double talk.\" I looked up what that term means, it means *deliberately unintelligible speech combining nonsense syllables and actual words.*\n\n... So are you saying that my post, the whole post was unintelligible and nonsense?\n\nTo whom? To the +500 people who chose to upvote it? To the commentors expressing gratitude?\n\nIs it really accurate to say that \"it doesn't mean anything\"? Or... is it possible that it just doesn't mean anything to *you*? Furthermore, is it truly accurate to say that I \"come across as just another self-help Guru\"? Again, to whom? Everyone, or just *you*.\n\nDo you see what I'm saying? It's one thing not to understand what you read, it's another thing *to just assume that it's meaningless because you don't understand.*\n\nIf you need clarification on something, let me know, I'm down to explain things in different ways. Or perhaps *I* need clarification on why you believe what I wrote here is false. Either way, I don't think it's enough for you to just leave a comment saying \"This guy is WRONG\" and then dip.
