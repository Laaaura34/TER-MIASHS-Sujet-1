I use it as my main form of \"texting\" with family and friends, also for video chats between different devices. Ive heard you can delete facebook, but keep messenger. \n\nAnyone care to elaborate either side for me?\n\nEdit: wanted to add: Way to go OP, sounds like youve really gotten better control over your life. Congrats, hope you find a great job when you graduate!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1tj2z/deleted_all_social_media_except_reddit_6_months/gk3d7g7/"}
