I just moved to a new town where I knew no one, was looking for part time work as I started an online business and had relied heavily on it to stay in contact with friends and family.  \n\nWhen I first started using social media like Myspace, I only had good feelings about it. I could maintain contact with old friends and stay on top of local events, etc - but pretty early on with FB I noticed mood swings in both directions based on responses to my posts and so over time was aiming for quality posts, curated to get the desired effect (mood boost based on replies, likes, etc). Quitting was this in reverse - I only noticed how much I missed it at first but over time realized my moods and overall mental health was much better. Now it literally looks insane to me and hearing people discuss reactions to their posts on SM breaks my heart. We are treating am as if it is not a choice any longer.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1tj2z/deleted_all_social_media_except_reddit_6_months/gk3m41h/"}
