I havent opened Facebook since. \n\nThe messenger I use to keep contact with friends overseas, college friends and some group chat for business purposes but have the notification turned off. I only open when absolutely needed. My local friends keep in touch using my mobile number. \n\nInstagram I use when I'm at a waiting room or something, but mostly for animals/travel pics and memes, again notifications turned off - I also find that in my country, Instagram loads faster with our shitty 4G compared to Reddit. \n\nSo my main platforms now are probably Reddit, Youtube and Netflix. \n\nCut toxicity in half, and saved my sanity.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1tj2z/deleted_all_social_media_except_reddit_6_months/gk2dzrd/"}
