Am now only on reddit and LinkedIn (but not active on li, keeping my account there for when I decide to switch jobs). It has made me so much more calm. I stopped comparing myself to others and beating myself up whenever they did appear to do better than me. I now have contact with my family and a handful of friends via WhatsApp and thats it. I'll see all those 300-or so acquaintances (were they friends?) whenever I see them. Or not. It saves me so much brain capacity.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1tj2z/deleted_all_social_media_except_reddit_6_months/gk1xm70/"}
