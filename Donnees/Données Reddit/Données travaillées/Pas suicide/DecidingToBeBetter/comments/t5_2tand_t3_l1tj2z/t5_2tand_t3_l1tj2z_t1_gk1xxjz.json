I pretty much never see the toxic side because all my dash is just full of rabbit accounts and I post photos of my jumping spider and tarantula, lol. So I go on Instagram for that sometimes. Facebook bores the hell out of me. I have it and check notifications from time to time. I unfollowed all my friends feeds last year because whilst my friends are all very caring people, they all post very very depressing shit, all the time. I would rather just have a conversation with them.\n\nReddit remains like a good online forum full of sub forums for everything with good content control.
