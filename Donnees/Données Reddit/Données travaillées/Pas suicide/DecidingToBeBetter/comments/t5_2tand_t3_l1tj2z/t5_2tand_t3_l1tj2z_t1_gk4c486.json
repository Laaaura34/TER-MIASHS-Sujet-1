Although, I don't know how long I have been off all platforms. I still have my Facebook though but I use it about once a month for like 5 minutes to check on something particular lol. \n\nMy life has improved so much since then. I share many of the same views you do. I basically live the life that people on Instagram/Twitter want people to believe they live. I make good money, travel, in a healthy relationship, work-out, have interesting conversation, and I never feel the need to boast it for the world to see. That sense of worthlessness that social media produces is too much. I don't want to contribute to that either. \n\nMy girlfriend went back on Twitter & TikTok about a couple weeks ago. Immediately, she went down a spiraling vortex of emotional negativity and depression. Her dopamine was being released every other second. It got to the point where she could literally do NOTHING with her life. She's also enrolled in a very demanding school, so she fell behind on material pretty hard. Since I've noticed what was going on, I had to really speak to her about quitting and the influence it has on her life. It's crazy to see what this stuff does to people, when you're on the other side.\n\nYou'll still catch me on Reddit though! :p", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1tj2z/deleted_all_social_media_except_reddit_6_months/gk4c486/"}
