That is the first step to what becomes maturity. What you are doing is recognizing that there is a problem but you were looking for a solution to fix it. My recommendation for you is to look at all the other comments in this thread and realize that we have all been in the same situation as you have. I think the best point of you that you should take a part in listening in is that you should consider doing meditation and realizing that not all these problems are because of you. Once you realize that you are not always the problem, that is when you start to make progress. Realizing that there are people out there who have the same problems as you interacting with you, is going to be the best way to look at interacting with others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgejw3/i_hate_the_person_i_have_become_and_i_cant_sleep/hi6q9j1/"}
