That makes sense.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry your friend isn\u2019t recognizing her part in causing very real hurt for you. And I\u2019m so sorry your ex cheated on you with someone you trusted. Having one person mistreat you this way is rough, having two people mistreat you and betray your trust is absolutely awful.\n\nWhen betrayals like this happen \u2014 and believe me, I\u2019ve been through a lot of them \u2014 it throws off our balance and can make us question ourselves and our own judgement. On top of that it can be hard to accept that someone(s) you loved, that you thought loved you, could be so cruel. \n\nAnd because it\u2019s near-impossible to make sense of it, sometimes it can be easier for us to look inward and try to see how WE can change, how WE might be the problem. Because that would be something in our control.\n\nAnd that tailspin is enough to cause so many of the thoughts you\u2019re having.\n\nWhat your ex and this girl did \u2014 what both of them did \u2014 was cruel. And what\u2019s worse is you\u2019re the only one having to pick up the pieces.\n\nThere is no great answer here, because you\u2019re dealing with an injustice. So here\u2019s what\u2019s helped me when dealing with similar situations:\n\nFeel your feelings, feel your rage and your jealousy, and everything. Write it down, get it out of you. It will hurt for a long time, but as long as you can physically hold on, you will come out the other side. You will be able to trust yourself \u2014 and other people \u2014 again.\n\nI promise.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgejw3/i_hate_the_person_i_have_become_and_i_cant_sleep/hi7lqqu/"}
