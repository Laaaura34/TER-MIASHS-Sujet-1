I will start I like the way you want to be better and are concerned with the feelings of others- it hows compassion.\n\nI think a lot of the negative feelings stem from the betrayal and it is them not you. \n\nPeople develop emotional intelligence at different rates and some of your friends may not have developed these skills. Give them the grace that they are unskilled and not sure of what to say or do.\n\nSome people make friends fast and others are more introverted and standoffish. Some of the best friends people have are from slow friendships that develop over years.  \n\nSometimes we overestimate the impact of our negative actions on others- try to be compassionate to yourself and others. One massive life lesson I have learned is if you have two choices - choose the kinder option. You never know who is having the worst day ever-  get into the habit of choosing the kinder option and giving others grace and compassion- it makes others feel better and you too. Small actions and a smile can mean the world to others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgejw3/i_hate_the_person_i_have_become_and_i_cant_sleep/hi637ya/"}
