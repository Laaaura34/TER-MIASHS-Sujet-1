The thing is, \n\nI kept asking too many questions about why they did this to me (before my birthday). \n\nMy former friend got really mad at me for asking her questions about it and being unable to move on from it. Hearing her tell me that \u201cit just happened\u201d and her \u201cnot knowing that we were together\u201d made me feel angry, sad and guilty. Because she is trying to remove herself from the drama by distancing herself and having a road trip so she can move on\u2026\n\nI remember talking to my friends about it with the idea that they will support me through it, only to justify my friend\u2019s actions.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgejw3/i_hate_the_person_i_have_become_and_i_cant_sleep/hi7jn47/"}
