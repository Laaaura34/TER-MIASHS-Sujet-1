I\u2019ve been on an antidepressant and that has helped turn my life around in many ways. But really what changed it all for me was realizing the absolute power in accepting that it was my fault my life felt the way it did. If it was my fault, my own doing, then I could still fix it by changing the things I didn\u2019t like about myself, my toxic traits. Little by little. You should give yourself some grace. Understand that you realizing these things about yourself is the mark of a TRUE person. A good, real person. There is nothing more valuable in life than the truth, and you have looked yourself in the face and admitted the ugliest truth to yourself, that there were some things you didn\u2019t like about you\u2026Id say roughly 80% of people in the world aren\u2019t even brave enough to do that - those are the ones who live miserably and die without having lived a meaningful life. You are not one of those people my friend. You admitted that you weren\u2019t living the way you wanted and you decided to make yourself better, for the people in your life and your greater happiness. You will do it and you will be happy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5otq3/current_toxic_person_looking_for_advice_from/hgg320v/"}
