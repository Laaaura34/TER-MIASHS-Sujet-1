Why?  Because the longer you wait, the more you can fool yourself into manipulating the process.  Doing things quickly makes you feel out of control, and that's exactly what you need to do - feel out of control and accept that.  \n\nAnd, all other issues aside, what is probably scariest is confronting yourself.  Subconsciously, you are probably manipulating yourself every day.  You are not willing to give this up, because you assume that you have a weak side that will take over and ruin your life if not kept in check.  However, if that side of you were truly weak, would you really need to keep it in check?  \n\nThat part of you that you are trying to hide is probably hidden because people have attacked it all your life.  But, people only attack parts of you that appear strong and threatening - so, much like other people have beaten that part of you down, your manipulation is probably designed to beat down that part of other people.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1v4agf/"}
