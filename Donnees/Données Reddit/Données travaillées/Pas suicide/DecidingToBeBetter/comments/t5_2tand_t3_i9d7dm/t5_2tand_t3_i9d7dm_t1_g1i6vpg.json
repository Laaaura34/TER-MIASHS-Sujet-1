But the threads and the books did not help me to find my triggers. It was not a living, breathing person that can really make me uncomfortable and learn how to be vulnerable without being defensive (something I still struggle with). I turned to self-education and knowledge as a means to tell myself that I am making myself better (and in some ways I was) but in the important ways I stayed the same.\n\nIf you truly want to change for yourself and your family, I hope you still seek and consider professional help as an option. Also remember: every therapist is different so if one doesn't work and look for another. Therapists are people too.\n\nBest of luck to you and your family.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1i6vpg/"}
