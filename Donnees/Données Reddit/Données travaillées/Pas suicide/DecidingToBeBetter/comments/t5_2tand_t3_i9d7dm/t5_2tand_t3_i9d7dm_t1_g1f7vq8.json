That's what makes you a sound person, and what makes me automatically think in 2 years he's not going to relate to these qualities anymore. \n\nMay I suggest writing a journal? Except this one's a little bit different. Every time you write in it, you can rip out the pages and burn them. The goal is to get to a place where you don't feel like you need to burn them, but at the start then letting your emotions out only to yourself and the book would be a great first step, and you can quite literally burn the evidence. I hope one day you can get to a place where your wife and you can both be emotionally available and open to each other. \nBest of luck :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1f7vq8/"}
