I'm actually a woman who has been in a deeply emotionally and at times physically abusive relationship. Something that helped me a lot in healing was to be able to hold space for the both/and of things. I had a hard time leaving because I thought of it as either/or. Hearing things like, \"abusers don't love their partners\" was very painful and I do think my ex loved me. He didn't have the tools to effectively deal with his emotions, and that came out at me. That is not an excuse for his behavior, but thinking of it that way made me realize that his behavior had nothing to do with me. He didn't treat me badly because I wasn't worthy of love or because I did something wrong, it was because he couldn't handle his own feelings. Once I saw it that way, I was able to say, \"ok, this isn't because of me, and yes he might love me, but that isn't enough. Things need to change or I need to leave.\" He didn't change, and I left.\n\nWhen we think of abusive people as monsters who have no empathy and we refuse to try to understand them, it puts people in confusing if/then situations. \"If abusers don't love their partners, and I label this behavior as abuse, then I am admitting nobody loves me.\" \"If people who abuse people are incapable of empathy, then my partner can't be an abuser because he is so kind and empathic with our children\" etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1hpb0u/"}
