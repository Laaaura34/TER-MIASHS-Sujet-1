I recently browsed my wife's search history and have found that she has recently found the term emotional abuse.\n\nLol at the first sentence. He doesn't realize how wrong this is in and of itself. \n\nThis sounds exactly like my ex (who was a narcissist). My ex put a very bad taste in my mouth for people like this and it's hard for me to believe that they can / want to change.
