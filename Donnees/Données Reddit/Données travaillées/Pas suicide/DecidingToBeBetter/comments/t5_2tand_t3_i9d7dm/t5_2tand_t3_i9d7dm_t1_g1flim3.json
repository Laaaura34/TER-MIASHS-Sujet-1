That act takes immense bravery and it shows what kind of man you can become. \n\nYes,  being a father who takes care of his family financially and doesn't abandon them is a wonderful goal but it isn't the full picture.  Teaching your children how to build and maintain loving, healthy relationships is the life skill they need most.   \n\nThey don't need an emotionally absent source of funds.  Of course this covers some needs, but the real need in my opinion is strong male emotionally connected leadership especially in conjunctionwith the strong  female leadership of your wife.  How you navigate your emotions instead of bottling them up.  How you love and show your vulnerability.   How you choose a partner to trust and grow with.  How to avoid or navigate other manipulators in the world and avoid abusive and toxic relationships.  This will help them figure there own way out of toxic personal and business relationships in the future. \n\nAlso, I reject this idea that emotions do not have a logic.   To me this is a male dismissal of emotions because it is generally a world women are more in touch with.   Our emotions are simple; fear,  love, anger.  It us only our blindness to them that makes it complicated.  You bottled up your emotions out of fear of the vulnerability they bring and because you did not have a good example of how to handle them.  That may be an oversimplification but it makes perfect sense to me. \n\nThank you for embarking on this journey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1flim3/"}
