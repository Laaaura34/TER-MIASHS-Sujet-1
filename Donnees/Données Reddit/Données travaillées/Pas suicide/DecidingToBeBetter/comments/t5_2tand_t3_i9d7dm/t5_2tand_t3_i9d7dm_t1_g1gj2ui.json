She would always make decisions based on how it would make her boyfriend feel - would he get angry? Not like her staying out late? He would also constantly check up on her, ask who she was with, when she would be back, etc.   \nIts going to take a lot of effort to rebuild trust, and trust will come when she says or does something that used to make you angry without you getting angry. Talk about and apologize for your manipulative tendencies every time they creep up (and they will), allow yourself and her to become better at recognizing them. She can help you with this. \n\nAnd remember that growth is often painful and confusing, so don't give up!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1gj2ui/"}
