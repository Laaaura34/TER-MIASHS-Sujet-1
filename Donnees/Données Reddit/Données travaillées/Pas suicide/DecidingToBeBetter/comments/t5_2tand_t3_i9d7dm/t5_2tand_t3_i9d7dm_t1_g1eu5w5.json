I think that you superficially want to change because being abusive means that you\u2019re not in control and that your wife could leave you whenever she realizes that she could do better. \n\nYou don\u2019t actually take accountability in this post. It isn\u2019t impossible to contextualize your issues and still take responsibility , but you didn\u2019t do that. Instead of actually showing that you have reflected at all on how your actions have felt to your family.... you just described your own emotions and how your own bullshit impacts you.... \n\nPlus, you feel entitled to go through your wife\u2019s post history in order to figure out what you need to fix about yourself to get her to stay. That\u2019s not long term change. You just want control. \n\n\nI don\u2019t believe you and this post in itself seems manipulative and puts a bad taste in my mouth. \n\n\nEdit:: Oh and you only see other people\u2019s emotions as manipulative and you found an excuse to get out of therapy? \ud83d\ude44 surprising.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1eu5w5/"}
