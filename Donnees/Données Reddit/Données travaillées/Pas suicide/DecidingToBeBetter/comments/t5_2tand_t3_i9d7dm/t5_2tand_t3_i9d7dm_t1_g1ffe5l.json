Do you recognise the emotional states of others? Do you take those into account on how to act?\n\nI used to be emotionally closed. My answer to any problem was logical, but I learned many people (especially women by my experience) do not want a solution, they want emotional connection, something along the lines of \"that sucks\", \"i am sorry that happened\"... Something to let them know you understand them and are on their side. This will help your wife for example to not feel alone. You can give a solution, but first give emotional support. Offer the solution when the feelings are stable and in control, even if that is the next day.\n\nWhen I opened myself I started becoming more emphatic and noticing others emotions better. I also had 6 months of mood swings due to getting used to different emotions, especially because I was feeling everything 100 times stronger. You will get through this.\n\nBTW: your mom sounds badass", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1ffe5l/"}
