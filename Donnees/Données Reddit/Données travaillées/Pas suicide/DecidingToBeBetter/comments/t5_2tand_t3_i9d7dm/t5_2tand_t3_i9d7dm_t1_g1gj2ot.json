They watch how I interact with their mother and will probably accept what I do as the norm. I would change this is hopes of giving a better chance for a better life for my kids..\n\nI will go back again and again to your post..thank you very much..", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1gj2ot/"}
