I've always thought that letting your emotions get the best of you was a sign of weakness.\n\nI believed that negative emotions were always just that, negative and should just be discarded. Not discussed. Shift from being sad to being happy by finding other things to do.\n\nI never in my life thought that a comment from a stranger can have an effect on me on this scale.. \n\nI hate dealing with emotions as I feel like a child just not knowing how to deal with them..\n\nI appreciate your comment, thank you very very much..", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1ertgv/"}
