She probably didn't spare her children in her manipulation and controlling tendencies, so look into trauma.\n\nHere's an introduction to how it could be helpful: The concept of \"[outer critic\"](http://pete-walker.com/pdf/ShrinkingOuterCritic.pdf) could help you pinpoint behaviors that impact others negatively (criticism or harshness). Before you turned anger outward, you might have internalized critical external messages and thus you have a nasty [\"inner critic\".](http://pete-walker.com/shrinkingInnerCritic.htm)\n\nThe book [The Body Keeps The Score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRCAuGLm6Jg) by [Bessel Van Der Kolk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXv4WobnwyI) is regarded in some internet communities (r/cptsd, for example) as the bible on trauma. It can help you figure out what a \"normal\" or healthy childhood looks like and what neglect or abuse look like in childhood. And the details on the consequences of that should sound familiar. A therapist who specializes in trauma might be a good fit for you, and might be less judgemental and more hopeful that you can get better than therapists with other approaches.
