I\u2019d focus my energies on putting aside enough money to afford it - it might take a while, but it needs not to take longer than what is necessary. \n\nI agree that you\u2019re making a great first step, but I want you to understand that it\u2019s  not enough, and for you to remember that you\u2019re not the victim here (sometimes it\u2019s easy to forget, it\u2019s not a jab at anything you\u2019ve said but just something you\u2019ll need to remind yourself once in a while). It\u2019s amazing that your wife keeps opening up to you despite your reaction, and it\u2019s a good sign that she wants to work through this! But you have to do your part and let her know you understand you\u2019re in the wrong, and that you want to become better. No excuses, no \u201cbuts\u201d. \n\nAnd I sincerely hope you\u2019re not here to have your ego stroked by people telling you how good you are. Remember that you\u2019re starting from below the line of the basic necessities in an heathy relationship. Don\u2019t glorify yourself or your journey because it won\u2019t do you any favor. Recognize your achievements but don\u2019t forget the road ahead.\n\nGood luck with your journey, and don\u2019t get discouraged!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1fe12u/"}
