That speaks volumes that you are willing to learn and grow. Most people never take the time to change or accept there is a problem. If you love your wife and she loves you, you can get through this together. Be open communicate and tell her how much you want to change and I\u2019m sure you will become a better and much stronger person for it. Toss aside the manipulation, and do some inner work on yourself. Love is the answer to all your problems, let people take their own paths in life and you do the same. You get back what you give out. Give out love and you will get love back.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1hqwq2/"}
