Lots of relationships are unhealthy. Caring about others is wanting them to express themselves and find fulfillment in the ways that are best for them, according to them. It is letting them decide what is best for them. It\u2019s not up to you. It is accepting them exactly as they are. This is why manipulation is quite literally the opposite of love in my view. Manipulation is trying to mold someone to who you want them to be, or assuming, arrogantly, that you know better than them on the one thing they know most about in the world: themselves. \n\nSorry, but can you extrapolate? I'm having a tough time understanding exactly what you mean here. I was in a relationship with somebody who was diagnosed as bipolar type 2 while we were together and was absolutely certain the best thing for them was to continue on as they were. They were heavily suicidal and didn't want to resort to medication/therapy because mania was \"kind of nice\". She was heavily against even going to the doctor after she was pushing me away so I could break up with her and she could kill herself. It took me many talks to convince her to go because I was 100% certain it was best for her.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1fhyio/"}
