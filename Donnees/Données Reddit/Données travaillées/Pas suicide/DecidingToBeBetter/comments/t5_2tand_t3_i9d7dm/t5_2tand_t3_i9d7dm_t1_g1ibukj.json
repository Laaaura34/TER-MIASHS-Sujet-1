I rationalized that crying should only be reserved for death and having to accept that it is part of the sad emotion that should be explored is overwhelming. I am not crying but I struggle holding back tears as I read supportivre comments.\n\nI have learned during my childhood to cancel out negative emotions, I believe that self pitty is useless and the worst kind of feeling in the world. I am currently  watching my kids and trying to hold back tears. I have for the longest time told them that crying is not a great way to resolve things.\n\nI always thought people who were in touch with their emotions as weak people. Turns out being able to manage them was the mentally stable thing to do.\n\nSorry for being incoherent and just self reflecting in this reply. I have yet to read about narcissism but I think I would fit descriptions like hand in glove.\n\nThank you for your supportive comment.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1ibukj/"}
