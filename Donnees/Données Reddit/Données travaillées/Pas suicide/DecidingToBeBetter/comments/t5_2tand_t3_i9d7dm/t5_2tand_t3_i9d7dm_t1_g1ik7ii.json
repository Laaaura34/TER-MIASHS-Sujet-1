This persona has helped land me where I am today.\n\nAnd this asshole persona has helped give me things in life that I would have never had the opportunity to have had I remained my loser self. The kid inside that I stopped to nurture is the same that I know cant hold the tears back.\n\nHaving talked to psychology majors during college, some have been baffled as to how much of a meathead I presented myself to be initially..\n\nI always thought I could be myself, the weak child with my wife. Turns out I've let my asshole self run the show.\n\nThe reason I struggle to let go of my asshole persona is the same reason I keep my loser kid inside.\n\nI never want to feel helpless again. I protect myself by being an asshole. But protecting myself and hurtingmy wife is not worth it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1ik7ii/"}
