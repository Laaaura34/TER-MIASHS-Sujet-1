Good job. \nTake some time to process this and come up with a sincere apology to your wife. \n\nSay your sorry, explain how you were being an emotional abuser, how this effects your wife, and what actions you'll take to not behave like this again. \n\nEach time you begin to identify yourself being an emotional abuser, work to not do that.
