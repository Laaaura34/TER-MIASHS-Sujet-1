We didn\u2019t breakup immediately, but things were never the same. \n\nIf you don\u2019t change the way you relate to her immediately entirely you will lose her.  \nYour description of how you treat people made me nauseous because that\u2019s how I was treated for six years and I was miserable. Your wife is miserable. \n\nShe can tell that you don\u2019t respect her. She can feel it every time you speak to her. \n\nYou need to acknowledge (**to her**) that you haven\u2019t treated her as an equal you\u2019ve been treating her as someone to be manipulated. \n\nIf not, I really hope your wife ends up like me and finds a man who actually validates her emotions and makes her feel safe. \n\nYou can fix yourself but if you don\u2019t also work just as hard on repairing the damage you\u2019ve done to your wife, she\u2019ll be dealing with the effects of you abuse for years to come. \n\nLearn all you can about gaslighting, then go talk to your wife and tell her she\u2019s completely justified in feeling the way she does. \nThat\u2019s a start.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1fn9at/"}
