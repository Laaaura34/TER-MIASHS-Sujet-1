Your comment along this whole thread fucking makes me feel bad..or sad, you have made me cry ugly-stupid and right now have a hard time as my kids are needing my attention..I just ran to the bathroom to sob and had to do so quickly..needed to compose myself and be the father I always wanted to have..a pillar of strength..and crying does not make me feel strong but helpless..it takes me back to the days when I was child who cried helplessly waiting for anyone to help..this, sucks..it feels bad..and this I guess is sadness..\n\nMy kids will never feel this way..they will always have me to peotect them..\n\nMan this shit sucks to the core. \n\nI feel bad that they may see their father teary eyed.
