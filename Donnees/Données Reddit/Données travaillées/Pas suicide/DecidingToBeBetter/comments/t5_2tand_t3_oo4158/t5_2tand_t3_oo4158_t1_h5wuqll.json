Keep it going. I didn\u2019t brush my teeth for years due to depression and shockingly don\u2019t have any cavities either! Last November I went to the dentist for the first time in five years and I had real bad calcium buildup in my gums and had to get a reallllllly painful, slightly traumatic and pretty pricy deep cleaning. It made it 10000x easier to floss (once I healed) and I\u2019ve been sooo on top of keeping my teeth clean since. Every time I go back, they tell me how good of a job I\u2019m doing, and the measurements of the space between my gums and teeth have been getting smaller and smaller.\n\nI feel like everything in my life is just a constant reminder that consistency is key! Letting things go for a long time and then dealing with it all at once SUCKS. But doing a little bit every single day is so healthy for your brain to just have that little routine and it makes life easier to deal with. Same with cleaning and exercising. Keep up the good work!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oo4158/dental_hygiene_brushing_teeth/h5wuqll/"}
