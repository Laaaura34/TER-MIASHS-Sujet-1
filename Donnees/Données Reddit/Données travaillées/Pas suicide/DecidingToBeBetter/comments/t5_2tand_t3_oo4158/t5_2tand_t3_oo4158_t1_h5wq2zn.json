Good luck to you too! Don't get me wrong, it wasn't just the toothpaste tasting awful to me, it was just a much bigger factor than I realized. Depression and it just becoming a habit after a depressive episode was the trigger. If you think that it would be helpful, I could find the name of the toothpaste I got. It's Vanilla Chai flavored and it tastes like pumpkin pie. I also like it because it doesn't ruin the flavor of other things like mint does so I don't have to brush after breakfast, which made me more likely to forget.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oo4158/dental_hygiene_brushing_teeth/h5wq2zn/"}
