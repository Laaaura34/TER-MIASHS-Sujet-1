What helped me is the realization, that every person\u2019s goal at every party is to a) feel comfortable and b) try to have as much fun as possible. \n\nWhat happened to me in the past occasions may have traumatized me at some degree,  it it also raised my self-awareness about how I feel at the particular party. So, in short, it takes me much more effort and the \u201cbar\u201d of comfort is much higher to me than to an average person. And that\u2019s why I don\u2019t push myself too much. \n\nI kind of flow with it. Even spend some time alone, observing the crowd. If I spot a group of people having too much fun laughing for instance, I\u2019ll come up to them and kind of wait for the right moment. And so on, and so on\u2026\n\nThe key aspect here is for you to feel comfortable. Remember, you came at the party to have good time. If you don\u2019t \u2014 LEAVE. It is ok to leave the party at any moment. Those other people (especially the ones that organized the party) take some responsibility for your fun. If the party is dull and even toxic, you should just leave. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about hurting some other people\u2019s feelings. As someone already mentioned above, everybody think about themselves.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdczxs/how_do_i_get_over_embarrassment_in_the_past/hhmkqj3/"}
