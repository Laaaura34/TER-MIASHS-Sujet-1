And we are mutually invested in each other being \"perfect,\" or at least \"perfect for each other.\" A lot of insecurities come up that haven't been examined yet. I also think this is why people break up and say, \"its not you, it's me.\" Suddenly, they were forced to look at themselves more closely and find themselves \"lacking,\" so they break up with the partner - subconsciously not wanting to look at their faults anymore.   I hope that makes sense.  Good luck - everything you say is normal, in my opinion.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpbwmwq/"}
