I definitely need to dive deeper into my thought patterns and find patterns. I guess my fear is that my relationships or work will unravel in the process. A bit of backstory, last year I lost over 100lbs and experienced the greatest mental clarity and enthusiasm for life I had ever experienced - recently, i\u2019ve stopped working out, stopped doing most of the habits that made me feel great, and i keep telling myself it\u2019s seasonal affective disorder - but i can\u2019t tell if that is just an excuse i\u2019m making up for being lazy and overwhelmed. I guess I am struggling to trust my own thoughts.\n\nThank you again for your input.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpc4xng/"}
