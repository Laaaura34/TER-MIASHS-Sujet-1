Talk to them about how their reaction makes you feel unheard. People are quick to dismiss the failings of their loved ones as being caused by something else, and want to find a solution to it. In my opinion, even if the cause of your behavior IS your boss and they\u2019re right, your feelings are still valid and put the onus on oneself to be better. \n\nIn many ways, taking responsibility for your own actions is more beneficial than finding accountability for the cause of these actions. Baby steps on aligning your behavior closer to the person you imagine you are will also provide the clarity and emotional distance to find out what\u2019s actually causing the behavior too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpc70u9/"}
