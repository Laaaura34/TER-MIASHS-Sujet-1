You will spend much less energy taking a step back and evaluating the moment and your feelings than you would recuperating from the results of your actions. Mindfulness is all about presence and how much of it you experience in each and every moment. I\u2019ve also found that asking someone if they meant harm helps quell my anxieties and misinterpretations. That way I know not to read into it too much because they affirmed that they did not mean to sound/seem negative or harmful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpc76by/"}
