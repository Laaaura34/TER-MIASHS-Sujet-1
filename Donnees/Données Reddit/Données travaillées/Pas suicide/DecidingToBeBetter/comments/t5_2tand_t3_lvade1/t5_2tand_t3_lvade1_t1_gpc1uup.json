The fact that you can self reflect and want to make improvements and be a better version of yourself is admirable in itself. Give yourself the time to do that! You have only just realized there are some things you want to change about yourself! If you are super hard on yourself this will be a painful process, change takes time and effort and is difficult, allow yourself to go slow and make mistakes. Allow yourself to learn how to change.\n\nWhat helped me is really drilling this mantra into my head: \u2018I am doing the BEST I can with my level of awareness and knowledge. I lovingly accept myself as I am now as I go through this journey of change and growth\u2019.\n\nYou need a mantra like that to remind yourself it\u2019s a process, you can\u2019t go from 0 - 100, you have to LEARN to be a different person, to learn how to break old habits and patterns. It\u2019s really hard to do this stuff, and if you are beating yourself up and looking for all the ways you\u2019re messing up, your focus won\u2019t be on the process of changing and how to help and support yourself through the process.\n\nAlso, you didn\u2019t know better, you didn\u2019t realize you were doing this stuff \u2018wrong\u2019 or whatever, so forgive that ASAP because now that you know, you\u2019re trying to change. You\u2019re literally doing your best. Don\u2019t hate on yourself for doing stuff you didn\u2019t even realize was a problem.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpc1uup/"}
