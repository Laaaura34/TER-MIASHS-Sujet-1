When that happens you\u2019re patient and will take the time to teach them how to do better. You do this out of love for them. \n\nSo when I make mistakes I recognize them as mistakes (not damning character flaws) and opportunities to learn to do better. They\u2019re humbling experiences that show me ways I need to improve. I used to talk to myself like I was sub-human garbage. Like, I wouldn\u2019t talk to my worst enemy the way I would talk to myself. But conceptualizing myself as if I were my own child made it so I want to help myself grow and learn and be the best I can be. Thinking that way really helped me a lot and I hope it can help you too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpcz3wp/"}
