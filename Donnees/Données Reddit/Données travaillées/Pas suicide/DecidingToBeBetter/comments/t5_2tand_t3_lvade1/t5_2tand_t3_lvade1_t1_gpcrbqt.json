Jung's archetype. There is no such thing as a perfectly good person. In Nazi Germany, there were many \"good\" people passively following along with an evil agenda. Sound's like you are recognizing flaws and acknowledging your shadow. \n\nAcceptance & commitment therapy might help with that, far more than CBT. Acknowledging and accepting this part of you and thanking your shadow, subconscious, whatever you want to call it for bringing it to your attention. Acknowledging that there are bad parts to you as well as good parts. You are a \"whole\" person, not an angel. \n\nRest assured you can continue to act according to any virtuous beliefs you may have rather than according to these negative traits inside of you.\n\n\"Get out of your mind & into your life \" by Steven C Hayes may be helpful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpcrbqt/"}
