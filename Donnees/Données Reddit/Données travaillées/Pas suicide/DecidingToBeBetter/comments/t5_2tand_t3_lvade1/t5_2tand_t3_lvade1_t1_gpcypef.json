Awareness is a huge first step and sadly many people spend their entire life ignoring that they could need to be a better person. \n\nI am going to second the advice of a good therapist (CBT) and recommend that you shy away from self treatment. It would be wise to have an actual psychologist evaluate your personality and determine exactly where you need skills training. \n\nThere\u2019s a really good book called Extreme Ownership by Jacko Willink that talks frankly about extreme ownership of the good, bad and ugly. Willink is a former Navy seal and he weaves in his experience in the seals with his premise to help businesses. While his program is designed for business leadership he ties it into everyday life as well. \n\nBest wishes!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpcypef/"}
