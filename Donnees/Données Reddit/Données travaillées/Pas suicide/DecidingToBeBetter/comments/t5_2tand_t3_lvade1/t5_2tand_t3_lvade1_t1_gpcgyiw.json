Mindfulness in regards to what you\u2019re saying. Do I need to say this right now? Is this a good time for the other person to hear/respond to me? Why am I berating myself, especially to others? Why am I not okay with just me? Like you said you need attention from others. Why? You\u2019re probably still a hard worker, you\u2019re just a little lost without the spotlight not directly on you. \nIt\u2019s great you have people you can vent to, but are you venting all the time? Are you an active listener? Do you turn conversations into your issues without empathizing with them? You sound a lot like me. Practicing mindfulness, empathy, and becoming an active listener really helped me. Also, it helps to get out of the \u201cwell this is just the way I am\u201d mindset. Practice retraining you\u2019re brain. A good thing that worked for me was not responding right away. Like if I were to have a situation where I felt like I could react, I would stop, ask for some time to think, then come back once I have thought of things from all the angles. I trained myself to react less, and act more. Don\u2019t beat yourself up so much. You\u2019re aware of an issue and you\u2019d like to address it. You\u2019re already on your way.
