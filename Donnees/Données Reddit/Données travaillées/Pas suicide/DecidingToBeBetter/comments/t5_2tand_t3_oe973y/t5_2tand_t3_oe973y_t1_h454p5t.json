Like include wake up and breakfast, lunch and dinner in the timetable as well as other things. Make a list at the beginning of the week of things you might want to achieve in that week, and just plan it in to a timetable day by day. You can only start to create branches, as you go from the trunk and upwards. Don\u2019t push yourself, but just try and make a start. Once you have a routine and are in control of your life, it might help motivate you for other things. \n\nExercise wise, have you thought about doing any online videos workouts? Even yoga? There are some great channels on YouTube with at home workouts and it might be worth a look just to make a start. I guarantee once you start you will gain motivation to keep going. But in terms of social anxiety (I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this) it might just take away that fear if you start at home and build up slowly. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oe973y/i_want_to_get_my_life_back_after_depression_any/h454p5t/"}
