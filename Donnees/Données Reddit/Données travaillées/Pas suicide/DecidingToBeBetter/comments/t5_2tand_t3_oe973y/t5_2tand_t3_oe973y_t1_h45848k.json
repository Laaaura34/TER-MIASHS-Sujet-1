One year things got really bad to the point I quit my job , stayed in only my room all day , didn\u2019t eat or drink except chocolate or a small snack and 1 water , stayed up all night and slept maybe 4 hrs, and stopped talking to all my friends. Prior to that , I had my shit together and was a social butterfly. Everyday , I felt like shit until one day, I realized I couldn\u2019t live like that for the sake of my friends (who had both died that same year ) and myself. I knew I wanted to do so much more with life, and I shouldn\u2019t waste it. I took things slowly like someone else mentioned.\nFirst , I focused on my nutritional needs. Food and water. I wasn\u2019t eating how I used to at first , but after a while , your regular appetite comes back and you start to crave things again. \nThen, physical needs came next. Working out is always a progress , but as long as you\u2019re consistent and doing an exercise that day , you\u2019re winning. \nMentally: Make sure you clear your mind every now and then of all the negativity. Remind yourself that everyday you\u2019re doing better than the last day.\nFriends came last. I started slowly with spending time with my family again. I also stopped talking to them. Then I started hanging out with friends who stuck by me little by little until I was able to go to social gatherings again and meet new people. \nAfter a few months , I wasn\u2019t exactly me, I still had things to adjust , but I was feeling more happy. And that\u2019s all that matters. It\u2019s going to be a progress but I know you can do it.\nI hope any of this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oe973y/i_want_to_get_my_life_back_after_depression_any/h45848k/"}
