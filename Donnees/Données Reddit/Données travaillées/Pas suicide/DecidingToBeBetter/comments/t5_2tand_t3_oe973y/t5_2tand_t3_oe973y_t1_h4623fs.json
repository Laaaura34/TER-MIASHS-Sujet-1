Just start beating winnable wars. I wake up a lot of times wishing I was dead. But I can get out of bed, pray for two minutes, and make my bed. I can at least do that. Then I can at least feed myself. Then I can at least do a few exercises at home. Just keep finding little things you can win at, then escalate to bigger things. If your old gym has a track for walking or running, just do that until you're ready to get back into lifting (if that's what you do). It takes a while to restablish the habit. But you have to start small. Good luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oe973y/i_want_to_get_my_life_back_after_depression_any/h4623fs/"}
