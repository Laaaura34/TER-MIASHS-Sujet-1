I'm afraid I can't give you an answer. That should be something a good doctor should be able to help you with, but I know good doctors can be hard to come by. Still, it might be helpful to talk to someone. \n\nI'm sorry to hear you're struggling right now. But I will say, I'm encouraged by the fact that you're considering both possibilities, that is, you recognize the role of your brain as well as your environment. I think it's really easy to ignore one of those factors, and the fact that you're talking about both means you don't have any huge blindspots, which I think bodes well for you.\n\nLike I said, I don't know what your situation is, but I know in my case, getting out of bad relationships was really important. I actually have a great relationship with my ex-girlfriend now, but when we were together, it wasn't working, and this took a big toll on me. I was stressed all the time, and that just made all my other symptoms flare up. When we broke up, it was painful, but the level of tranquility I experienced afterward was so worth it. I don't think any amount of medication would have remedied that situation.\n\nThat being said, sometimes it is the medication that needs addressing. And if you're feeling like your life situation is terrible and you're too depressed to do anything about it, then maybe you can start with the medication, too. You don't have to fix everything at once.\n\nSending you lots of love, dude. Best of luck. PM me if you want.
