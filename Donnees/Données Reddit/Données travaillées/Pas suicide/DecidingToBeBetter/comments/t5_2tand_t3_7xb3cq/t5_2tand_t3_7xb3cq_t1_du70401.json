(I also got a Vyvanse prescription, fixed my sleep schedule, have been watching Joel Olsteen, and have been going to the library).  One thing Joel Osteen has helped me with is dropping social and societal pressure. I have felt so much guilt from my family (my dad is asking me how many interviews I've had this week and I'm thinking to myself that I haven't even updated my resume yet), but Joel Osteen is great at saying drop societal pressure and this is between you and God (your conscience) and that you can do it. I know this is a funny statement but I tell myself if I work hard all day than I can reward myself at night by smoking a bowl and watching some Joel Osteen lol.\n\nEdit: imagine if Rob Lowe's super positive character from Parks and Rec had many super positive 30 minute speeches on YouTube.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xb3cq/anyone_have_any_true_comeback_stories_that_can/du70401/"}
