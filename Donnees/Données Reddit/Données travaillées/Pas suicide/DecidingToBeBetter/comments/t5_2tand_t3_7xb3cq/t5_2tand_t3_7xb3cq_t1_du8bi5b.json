I had never done it really, but was very interesteed/fascinated by it. I am great at learning hands on and building things (turns out I'm even better at mental work). Lastly, in my area at least, it paid very well. So in the northwest U.S. as a pipefitter/welder for a mechanical company, you get paid per the county. Jobs are all over the state, but some counties you make 76$ per hour, some you make as low as 37$ per hour. Either way, it's a great way to get money quick while you go to school for a more long term career. There's also a retirement 401k loophole that is one of a kind for the job. Nowhere else can you put so much money in your 401k so quickly! Anyways. I figured it was better for me to just start SOMETHING. Might as well start something with a low barrier to entry and high income. You'll have plenty of time to figure out a long term career later. You'll find that having money and investing young is VERY IMPORTANT.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xb3cq/anyone_have_any_true_comeback_stories_that_can/du8bi5b/"}
