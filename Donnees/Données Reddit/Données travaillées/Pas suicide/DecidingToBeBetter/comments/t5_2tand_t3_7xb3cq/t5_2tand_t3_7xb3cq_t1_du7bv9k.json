I'm also 27 now. \n\nGirlfriend of 3 years, lived together, was going to propose. She randomly broke up with me. I wanted to kill myself. I wrote off my car by driving into a fence because of my medication. But I too knew that this would be the start of my comeback. \n\nI realised all of the negatives within our relationship. I moved in with my grandparents and now have a deposit to buy a house. I realised my job was shitty so I randomly went for interviews for jobs I thought I couldn't get. Landed one and I'm now sat in a hotel room working away with said company.\n\nThe best part about now though is that I have a girlfriend and she treats me amazingly, she's kind and selfless and we both reflect that onto each other. We build each other up. \n\nYou've got this man, if I can suggest a few things:\n\n- Write a letter for yourself to open in 1 year. \n- Do something you've always wanted to do but never had the courage, don't think about it. Just do it. \n- Listen to \"[Baz Luhrmann - Sunscreen](https://youtu.be/sTJ7AzBIJoI)\"\n- See your friends, speak to old friends you haven't seen in a while\n\nFeel free to PM me if you need any other advice or just wanna chat.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xb3cq/anyone_have_any_true_comeback_stories_that_can/du7bv9k/"}
