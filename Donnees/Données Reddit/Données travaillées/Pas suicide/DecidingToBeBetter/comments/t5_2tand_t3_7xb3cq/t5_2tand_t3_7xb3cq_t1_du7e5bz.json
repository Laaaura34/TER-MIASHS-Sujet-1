I had to move back home for my last year and a half of college. After I graduated, I was able to move out but then a year later I had to move back because my roommate had moved and I couldn't afford to live on my own at the last minute. \n\nI was bummed because I felt like I wasn't doing enough, but in hindsight I am really happy that it happened because I got to spend a lot of time with my dad and my family which was a really different dynamic as a result. I was at home for about a year before I had a job offer take me halfway across the country.\n\nWhile I love what I do, there's definitely times when I find myself wishing that I was back home with my family and I would move back there in a heartbeat if the opportunity came around. Enjoy the time with your parents, keep your head down and work hard at whatever you decide to do, and when the time comes for you to move on then you will be able to do so without any regret about the time that you spent there.\n\nAlso, organizing the area that you live in could be a big help. Even if it is your parents stuff, having some order around you can be a big help as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xb3cq/anyone_have_any_true_comeback_stories_that_can/du7e5bz/"}
