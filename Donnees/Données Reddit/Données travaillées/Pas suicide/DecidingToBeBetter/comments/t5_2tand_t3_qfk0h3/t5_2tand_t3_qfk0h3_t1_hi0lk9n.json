One of my main sources of anxiety my whole life was trying to control how others perceived me- I would waste enormous amounts of energy to never be seen as \u201cwrong\u201d because my ego was too fragile to handle it. I think what really signals to others that you\u2019ve changed (more so than standing up for yourself) is spending time alone to fully realize your personal philosophy and ideology of how to handle your own life and how people treat you. That way when a situation does arise, you know exactly how to respond without any regret. (Stand up for yourself, ignore them, etc) When you you are able to respond to any situation quickly and efficiently (even if it\u2019s not perfect) 9/10 most people who put you in those situations don\u2019t expect a quick reply, let alone one at all. So when you perform above their expectations like that, most likely you\u2019ll put them into an awkward position, cause they won\u2019t have anything planned next since most people don\u2019t react as well and quick as that. People are always trying to find an opening to pick on someone else and make themselves feel better (if that person is insecure) so as long as you find peace within yourself (with your own perceived shortcomings) to avoid showing any openings to these garbage people, you should see a dramatic decline in how many people bully you or anything else.
