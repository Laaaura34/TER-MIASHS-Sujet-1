I had to learn the same lessons you\u2019re asking for and I\u2019m still unlearning all the wrong things from my teens and 20s. But the singular biggest success for me was: You don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation. Tell them they hurt you, how, and let them figure out their own truth. I had to cultivate a lot of internal peace to stay sanguine in the face of a bully. You\u2019re also allowed to disengage and walk away from people who are shit, either momentarily or forever. And the biggest thing is, let em laugh. Don\u2019t laugh with them or get flustered, just stand and look at them while they do then repeat your request/command in a clear non confrontational tone. Bullies hate not getting an emotional response. This is a really cool YouTube Channel and I\u2019ve used it effectively at work and in other social situations, it might help to watch and research the topics spoken about if you were interested in learning this way. They aren\u2019t going to make every situation, but knowing HOW to stay calm, or why certain kinds of people do things, or even the correct words is a powerful tool. You\u2019ve got to teach people how to treat you. Good luck and I wish you only love and happiness\n\nhttps://youtu.be/g5RknemM8Hw", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfk0h3/how_do_you_speak_up_for_your_self_without_causing/hi41jv8/"}
