A couple of additions:\n\n1. Imagine a thick glass wall force field between you and the other person.\n\nThen, 2. Calmly state what the other person did which was not cool.  \n\n3. Expect they will have a nasty response and that most of the time, you can\u2019t change people in an instant.  Rather than taking their words or actions personally, focus your brain power on the strategic response.  \u2014 as in which words will help you \u201cwin\u201d.  Notice politicians and lawyers often do this.  Whenever they get insulted or challenged by their opponent, and they don\u2019t knee-jerk resort to anger.  Instead they will have anticipated the objections and respond accordingly with persuasive rhetoric.\n\n4. Detach yourself from the outcome.  \n\n5. Don\u2019t carry the negative experience in your mind and heart after it has been resolved.  \n\nLastly, prepare a notebook for yourself and imagine certain scenarios which would bother you.  Brainstorm what you would say to make yourself feel empowered in those situations.  Write these down and actually say the words out loud so you can feel confident, and you can practice.\n\nKeep in mind, some people are just aggressive to everyone around them.  Pure avoidance could be the best response in certain cases.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfk0h3/how_do_you_speak_up_for_your_self_without_causing/hi3iza5/"}
