You have to get out of your comfort zone and learn to take small doses of rejection. Over time that will build. For me, I worked at a grocery store for two years (starting shortly before finishing high school), and retail being retail, there were plenty of sh\\*\\*\\*y customers, so I learned fairly quickly. Learning not to take things personally also helps. That's a hard hill to get over, but if you can train your mind to do so you'll have a much easier time standing up.\n\nAlso, standing up does not have to equal making a scene- I feel like that does the opposite. I would highly recommend reading *Quiet* by Susan Cain on this part.\n\nI'm still working on this, but practice does pay off. Things don't bother me a quarter of the amount they used to. I actually notice this now in my daily life when things I remember clearly bothering me in the past not bothering me at all.\n\nI don't know if this helps, but hopefully its encouraging even if the advice wasn't great :) Best of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfk0h3/how_do_you_speak_up_for_your_self_without_causing/hi0su6y/"}
