I can totally relate to what you\u2019re saying and I am still trying to overcome my fear of speaking up for myself. \n\nIt starts in the smallest of situations. For example, when someone cuts the line, or when someone tries to speak over you. I learnt that sometimes we have to put ourselves in uncomfortable situations. This helps us grow in several aspects. \n\nI used to overthink every single thing at work. Even when I know I am right, I wouldn\u2019t speak up. Because I was so scared of being judged. But a small trick that always helps me is saying \u201cfuck it\u201d. I would write that email/message or have the things ready in my mind and say \u201cfuck it\u201d(to myself Ofcourse) and spill it out. Whatever comes next, I know I can handle it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfk0h3/how_do_you_speak_up_for_your_self_without_causing/hi2u9dt/"}
