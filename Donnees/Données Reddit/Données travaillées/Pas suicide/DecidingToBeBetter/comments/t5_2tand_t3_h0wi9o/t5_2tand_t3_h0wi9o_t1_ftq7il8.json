They will never taste good again.  I struggled with quitting, I smoked for about twelve years before I tried quitting and it took me another few years of quitting for a month, buying a pack, quitting for another month, and so on.  I eventually went a year and a half without smoking then caved one night and bought a pack.  I took one drag and before I could exhale I puked my guts out.  It was the foulest thing I have ever tasted.  Somehow smoking now triggers my gag reflex so I physically can't enjoy it.  Keep that in mind if you ever think about picking it back up again, it's not going to be like a \"oooooh fuck yeah\" moment.  It's going to be gross and you're going to wonder how you ever got addicted in the first place.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h0wi9o/cannot_believe_after_12_years_smoking_im_now_35/ftq7il8/"}
