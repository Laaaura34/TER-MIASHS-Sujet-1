I started smoking when I was 18, \"quit\" when I was 22. I would smoke a cig here and there when I was out drinking but quarantine has had the opposite effect on me. I have bought a vape and am smoking 50 mgs. I keep saying I'm going to quit but don't feel I have the strength to do it again. Seeing how you were able to quit after much longer it restored my faith in my abilities.
