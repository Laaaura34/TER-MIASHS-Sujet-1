Read Get Your Sh*t Together by Sarah Knight. I highly recommend the audible, the author narrates it and her guidance could be what you need. Direct advice. \n\nI understand you\u2019re having a tough time and I\u2019m sad to hear that. I like that you came asking for advice, it means you haven\u2019t given up! Don\u2019t give up. You have two dogs?! Some can\u2019t even afford the lifestyle for one. Please find time to exercise and sleep well. That\u2019s what our body needs when we feel down.\n\nYour dogs need you too. Sometimes feeling needed is what keep people going. Your dogs need your love and care. Don\u2019t terminate early. Don\u2019t end your life. Your dogs are bonded to you. Maybe there will be others to adopt them. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019re the one they want to spend time with, you\u2019re the most important person in their lives. Keep trying, keep planning, make a plan and work through it to improve yourself. Change won\u2019t happen overnight, remember that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfncj3/hello_if_i_dont_change_i_will_probably_seek_an/hi4oddf/"}
