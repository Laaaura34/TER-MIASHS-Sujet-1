I left my parents house to get \"the college experience\" and while it got me out of my comfort zone, my finances sank, my credit score is cringe-worthy and I have no savings. \n\n\nI'm still in school, but I took a year and a half off due to finances and health issues. I have two more semesters left. I didn't study. I skipped classes, I dropped some. \n\n\nMy high school GPA was a 3.89. In college right now, it's about a 2.0. College is freaking hard, man. Don't beat yourself up. But don't think that because you hadn't succeeded yet doesn't mean you won't. \n\n\nI had a great time being up here, away from my parents. (Honest to god - I love my family, so it's not like I wanted to LEAVE home, I just wanted to go to college) I hooked up with guys, made friends, developed some mental health issues, had some ups and downs. \n\n\nYou're young, which is awesome. Before you do move out, if you do, don't take it for granted that your parents are able to help you financially. **Please** don't take that for granted. And just know that it's not easy going to school AND working in order to pay rent for the apartment.
