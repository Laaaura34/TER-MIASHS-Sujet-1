It did not help that my wife would convince me to give her company on days I would want to not do it.\n\nEventually about a year ago I suddenly felt I was doing no good to myself. I live in Toronto and lately I'm noticing that smoking cannabis is being more and more accepted here. I don't think that's okay. I understand recreational use but I'm seeing more and more of my friends and family start to develop a dependence. And before I get clobbered by the 420 brigade for hating, YES, while it is a theory that you cannot develop a dependence for cannabis the way you would for heroin or even nicotine I don't think long term effects of daily use are well understood. \n\nAnyway I took control of my shit and stopped cold turkey. Slowly, after months of convincing and a couple of fights I was able to show my wife how we had more meaningful conversations and spent ab overall better time together when neither of us was stoned.\n\nMy life is better now, we've got a mortgage, we are going to buy a car soon and we save the 150 dollars a month we spent on cannabis and put it to good use now.\n\nYou should be proud of yourself buddy.
