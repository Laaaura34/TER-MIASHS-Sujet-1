I know this one has gotta feel emotionally raw. First love is like that. But as you get older, you\u2019ll see that she is rotten and ain\u2019t worth all this grief. Truly.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t let your history with this girl cloud your judgement. Anyone who treats you like that is trash. Sorry to say it bro.\n\nI\u2019d say be careful about being in lopsided relationships. You shouldn\u2019t keep giving to someone who only takes or who doesn\u2019t even appreciate it. Be kind and loving and all that, but don\u2019t become a bitch.\n\nYou know all this tho bro. I know you do. Sometimes these situations just happen. Especially when you are young. \n\nAlls I can say is that I know without a doubt that you\u2019ll heal from this. Hit the gym. Get a new healthy hobby. Follow your dreams in life. And good things will come.\n\nOh and there is a good chance she\u2019ll come texting back when she gets burned out there. Do yourself and everyone else a favor and ghost her when she does. Don\u2019t bitch out on that cause your sad. \n\nYou\u2019ll be alright. Congrats on taking the first step.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0gmvm/ending_a_big_chapter_in_my_life/h87cu2p/"}
