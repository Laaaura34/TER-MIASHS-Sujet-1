I never fully cheated but I did some toxic stuff that caused pain and trust issues at the beginning and the end of our relationship. We were very codependent so we both latched on to each other but also hurt each other a lot when we felt hurt. But the middle 3 years were filled with the most loving beautiful and healthy human connection that two people have ever had. I have felt such debilitating guilt and shame from what happened between us and how much unbearable pain he has been in since I ended it. I basically shattered his heart and hopes and dreams with a very \"it's not you it's me\" situation on my end due to things that are integral to my identity. I wish I could speak for all of us pain-causers and say sorry to all of you who have been on the receiving end of it, but it sounds like your ex doesn't feel that way and I am sorry you have to go through that on top of everything else.\n\nWe broke up about 3 months ago and the past few days have been the first days of no contact (he decided he really needed the space to heal) - the last time I talked to him was Friday and it feels like it has been decades. I think the longest we have ever gone without talking since we met was like 2 days. I am so worried about his wellbeing and I just always wanna know how he is doing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0gmvm/ending_a_big_chapter_in_my_life/h87lanc/"}
