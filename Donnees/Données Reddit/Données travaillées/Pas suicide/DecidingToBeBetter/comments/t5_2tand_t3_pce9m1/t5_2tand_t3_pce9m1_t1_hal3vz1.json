I know that constant stress, although not your experience but ofc mine. \n\nI can find relaxation in various things but the first I would recommend for you is meditation. I've the app 'Lojong' it's pretty much free if you click that you can't pay. It has anxiety and happiness mediations. Not everytime I feel relaxed but at least half of it. Don't expect it on day one. I'm now through my first month. \n\nAlso it can help to finish tasks to be more calm\n\n-- this is purely my experience.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pce9m1/what_even_is_relaxing/hal3vz1/"}
