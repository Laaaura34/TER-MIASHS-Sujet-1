What do you do? . As you regain balance, you turn to that person and say \"I am sorry\". You don't feel guilty - it's not your fault but still you feel that person's pain and express that feeling. You don't really care whether the person is mad at you or whether she forgives you. You have expressed what you felt. You learn to use a better stance and hold tighter onto those hand grips (i am not a native speak and don't know the proper names for those pipes to hold on) and move on with your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/e4m97a/i_harassed_a_girl_in_my_school_last_year_and_now/f9fhpym/"}
