If she's willing, then take that moment to say something like \"Hey, I'm really sorry for having made you and Karr feel uncomfortable in the past and it's just been bothering me for a long time since we're in a lot of the same classes and clubs. I'd just like to apologize and hopefully be a little more comfortable around each other. And if my apology isn't enough, do you mind telling me what I can do to make you feel more comfortable?\"\n\nAnd you can also ask if it's possible to apologize to Karr herself, while completely understanding if she says no to that. At the very least, an attempt to apologize is known. \n\nAnd if she says that she's been ok with the safe social distance you already silently established, then that should still be fine. At least you get to properly acknowledge it and move on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/e4m97a/i_harassed_a_girl_in_my_school_last_year_and_now/fcd21n5/"}
