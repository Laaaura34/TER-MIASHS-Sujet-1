I lived in a bedroom with just my ADHD meds, liquor and a computer for a long time too. No real place to go work, but I tried to keep making games. Never really got far though.\n\nOddly enough, it was when I had to medically detox from alcohol that change started happening, my meds got cut off, and I started going to AA(I don't really anymore, but I keep up with a few friends from it).\n\nNow, even though my life isn't where I thought it would be, I do feel better. I'm not drunk all the time, I'm drinking \"responsibly\" with the help of a medication, and I am constantly trying to work on myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nxwk87/i_feel_that_my_mind_has_decayed_significantly/h1kyja8/"}
