I was 14 when i was told that if i needed anything to ask but everybody was in this life for themselves.\nThis dedication lead me down a path of cooking & cleaning our home when i would come home from either school or work, learning how to remove bodily fluid stains, how to choose proper medical equipment, and how to deal with legal matters for her. My social life was the biggest sacrifice.i can't remember the last time I've had a date.\n\n I swore i would do everything i could to make sure my mom got what she gave to me and the price was huge. When i turned 21 i creeped down the rabbit hole that my father fell into just to keep the night terrors at bay. I'm sober now for her sake buti can never seem to sleep well anymore. No regrets though. almost a decade later im still giving my all. 85 hour work weeks. Home gym has been my only release.\n\nThis is the path i chose and it is still so worth it.\n\u270c\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hr51p2/when_was_a_time_that_you_chose_the_painful_yet/fy20741/"}
