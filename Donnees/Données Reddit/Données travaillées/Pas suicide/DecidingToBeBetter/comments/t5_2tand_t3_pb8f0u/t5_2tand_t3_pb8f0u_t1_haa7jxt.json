For some reason, the idea of Self Soothing popped into my head probably from a human development class I\u2019d taken.  Babies learn to self soothe and I was confident I could too.

My advice would be to build your emotional strength and tend to it like a Gardner.  This is your life my friend and now is the time from one who knows.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pb8f0u/how_do_i_reduce_my_emotional_dependence_on_others/haa7jxt/"}
