It\u2019s probably the best bet.\n\nI can relate to what you are saying having experienced that at your age.  I have changed with time.\n\nWhat helps is developing your life.  Meaning outside of relationships.  Dig deep and consider who you really admire.  For me, it was artists who had their little booths at arts festivals.  Once I set out to do that, I found this base of self sufficiency and pride.  It also filled a lot of my time.  If you focus on you and not others for a bit, it will change you.\n\nTherapy is best tool to teach you that you don\u2019t need anyone else to affirm your feelings.  But ultimately a universal truth is you don\u2019t.  You are strong enough and you have all that you need.  That doesn\u2019t mean you never lean on friends.  It just changes form into what you see others do\u2014it\u2019s not so desperate. And that feels good.\n\nHow are your boundaries?  Another exercise is deciding to say no to things you don\u2019t want to do/agree to and finding out other people\u2019s anger won\u2019t kill you and you\u2019ll feel more empowered.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pb8f0u/how_do_i_reduce_my_emotional_dependence_on_others/hab56rl/"}
