I have trich as well. It's strange. I really enjoy how I look with some facial hair, I enjoy that I see it and see a physical manefestation of me overcoming my urges and letting my hair grow. But the cold truth is that if I resist the constant urges for a week, and slip up for 15 minutes, it's all lost. At least it feels that way. The feeling of having the shave because I made an obvious bald patch is a feeling of defeat. A feeling of letting myself down. It's easy for me to get myself down from it, but we have to remember it's just a disorder. Something we have, not who we are, and not something that reflects poor character. It just is. Even if it gets the best of us, we just gotta try to let it grow again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfqvgqz/"}
