I wish I could help in that regard. However, there are many great YouTube videos and tedtalks that discuss the \u201cAttitude of Gratitude.\u201d Also look up \u201cNeuroplasticity\u201d by Dr. Caroline Leaf. She\u2019s an incredible cognitive neurologist and communicative pathologist and she goes into depth over how we literally rewire our brain with our thoughts, and how to change it to benefit us.\n\nThe biggest thing that will help you overcome complaining and negativity is gratitude. It all starts in small steps. When you encounter a frustrating situation, say out loud \u201cI\u2019m so grateful/ thankful for this teaching me\u2026\u201d. Even if you have to force yourself. Even if you have to come up with the smallest, silliest reason.\n\nI really wish I could give you more in depth resources, but I hope this helps some!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfqlxaa/"}
