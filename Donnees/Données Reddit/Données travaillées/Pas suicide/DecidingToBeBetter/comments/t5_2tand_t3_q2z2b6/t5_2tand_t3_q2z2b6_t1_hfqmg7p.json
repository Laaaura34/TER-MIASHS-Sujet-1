Now I\u2019m nearly 9 months sober and literally everyday I notice something in my life that\u2019s better without the weed. The house is cleaner and more organized. I don\u2019t miss important deadlines. Our income has gone up by thousands of dollars (both by not buying weed, not making impulsive purchases, and running our business more efficiently). My kids are visibly much happier. I don\u2019t avoid calling my family and no -smoking friends.
