And Kevin says something along the lines of \u201cyes, but it\u2019s not about the first thought that you have been conditioned to think. It\u2019s about the next one, what you have a taught yourself.\n\nI know the line is probably very different but that\u2019s how I remember it. And it made me really think about how I would think about people and judge them very quickly. For example, if I saw a girl out with short shorts on, I would instantly think about how much of her skin/legs she\u2019s showing, but then in my next thought I would remind myself that she can wear whatever the hell she wants to, and it does not affect me and I should not ever judge people in such a way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfse5xm/"}
