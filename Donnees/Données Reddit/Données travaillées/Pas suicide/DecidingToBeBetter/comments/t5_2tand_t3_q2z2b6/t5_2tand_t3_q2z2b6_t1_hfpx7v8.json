Like a hundred times a day. \n\nLast night, we were out with some friends. He has been dealing with some stuff lately and has understandably been a bit off. When he stepped out for a minute, our friends asked me if he's okay. I said he's going through some shit. \n\nAfter we left the bar, I told him about this and asked him if he's okay. He always says he is okay and rarely admits that he is upset. I was drunk and started pushing him to tell me the truth, which turned into a huge fight. I was being extremely toxic and mean to him, calling him an asshole and whatnot because he wouldn't \"tell me the truth\". \n\nThis morning, I had a major wake up call and woke up with a deep sense of regret. I realized that I have no right to know something if someone else does not want to share it, and my pestering later develops into bullying. So even though my intentions are in the right place, I need to cut the bullshit out-- I apologized to him and told him my behavior was extremely disrespectful and thanked him for being patient with me, even though I don't deserve the patience. \n\nGot my first therapy appointment on Tuesday. I do not want to make the person who loves me the most in this world and who I love with all my heart feel like shit. I'm a major asshole for putting him through that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfpx7v8/"}
