Never used to exercise.  Ate whatever I wanted. I'm 37(f) now and it all was taking its toll on my body and mind. I've lost 60 lbs since last September and I'm a different person than I was a year ago. \n\nI work out 5-6  days a week now for stress relief and strength training.  I'm working on giving up weed but that's tough for me as it really does help manage my anxiety better than anything else I've done.  I just need to stop getting absolutely baked. I stopped drinking as well.  \n\nI also used to watch porn... a lot.  I see now that it is super toxic for me and was warping my sense of reality. I have backed off a lot but the temptation is strong at times and I hate how accessible it is. \n\nOne day at a time.  Mostly,  making time for myself to work on myself as a priority has helped changed my mindset tremendously.  Making the time was one of the most challenging parts of making change.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfpq0l3/"}
