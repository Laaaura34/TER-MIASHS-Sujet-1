Furthering what u/NatureWalker9 said, it's important to actually SAY and/or WRITE the new thoughts that you want to imprint.  Slower, intentional breathing while you do it will make a difference, too.  If you can incorporate some sort of movement/gesture as well, power to you.  Research supports this!\n\nThe thing is that we're always trying to fix our problems in our minds, or waiting for a revelation to change the way we think (\\*raises hand\\*, I'm very guilty of this.)  However, to change our thoughts, we underutilize the **KINESTHETIC LEARNING** needed. Think of how many religions use mantras/chanting/singing in their devotions, especially while doing a repetitive motion like bowing or dancing... Heck, think of a boot camp military unit singing together while running in unison.
