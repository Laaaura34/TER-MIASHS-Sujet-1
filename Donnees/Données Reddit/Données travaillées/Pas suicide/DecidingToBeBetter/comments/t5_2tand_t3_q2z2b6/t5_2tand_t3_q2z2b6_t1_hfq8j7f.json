Supposedly, if you eat lightly one day, eat nothing the next, and then eat lightly the third day at the time(s) you want to eat, you'll adjust the time(s) during the day that your body sends hunger signals. I'm giving it a go next week from Monday to Wednesday if you'd like me to follow up and let you know how it goes. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfq8j7f/"}
