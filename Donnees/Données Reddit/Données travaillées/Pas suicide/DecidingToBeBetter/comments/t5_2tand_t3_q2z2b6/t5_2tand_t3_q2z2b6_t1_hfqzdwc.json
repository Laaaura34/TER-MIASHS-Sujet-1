Genuinely curious, how have you made a meaningful change towards genuinely having more gratitude without going too far and slipping into \"toxic positivity\" / gaslighting yourself?  (Where you're positive but not authentic or accepting of yourself - for example, correcting a negative thought by thinking some version of \"you're complaining again!  Try to find the gratitude in this situation. Don't be so negative, you're not trying hard enough, no one likes a whiner,\" etc.)  I struggle with moderation here... lol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfqzdwc/"}
