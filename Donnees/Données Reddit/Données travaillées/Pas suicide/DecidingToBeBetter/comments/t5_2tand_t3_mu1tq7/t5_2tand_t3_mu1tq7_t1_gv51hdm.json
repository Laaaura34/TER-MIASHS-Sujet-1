I was so proud of myself, too... then I went home to visit family and said yes to smoking a blunt with old friends and.... that was it. I wanted more and started using more because I realized how much I missed it. Of course I\u2019ll miss it, it does help but it\u2019s not healthy and I truly want to quit. It took me going through a lot of denial to realize, yup, I\u2019m addicted and reliant on it. That\u2019s not healthy in general with anything. \n\nI hope this time I can push longer than two months and even more, so on. \n\nThank you for your words!
