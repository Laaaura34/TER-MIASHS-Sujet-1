Just wanna say congrats and I relate to this story and sentiment very well.\n\nBeen strictly off weed for almost 3 weeks now and the quality of life changes are just settling in and only getting better day to day. It\u2019s hard to look back and see how I was functioning day to day with that stuff in me but never the less we grow from our past. \n\nI want to start closing out my rings everyday as well and this has motivated me to do so. Thanks for sharing and keep living strong brotha!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mu1tq7/10_months_sober/gv51ccq/"}
