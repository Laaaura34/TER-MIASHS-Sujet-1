I have shed many tears and relapsed thousands of times.  But one time I decided not to quit it for a month or two but for life, aaaand of course I relapsed, but I changed my mentality and instead of going into a spiral of addiction again because I lost my streak I came to the conclusion that after one relapse I don't lose my all progress so I kept going. I stopped counting days. With this mentality even if your relapse after 200 days(which happened to me) you'll still be able to go for another 200 days because deep in mind you know that your progress is not gone!\n\nI think that's the key to beating this addiction: stop beating yourself for one relapse and stop counting days after 30 or so.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmqye4/giving_up_on_weed_alcohol_coffee_and_added_sugar/hck58if/"}
