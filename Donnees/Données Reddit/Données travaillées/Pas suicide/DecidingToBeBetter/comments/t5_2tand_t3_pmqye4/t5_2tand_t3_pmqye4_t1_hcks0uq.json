I would do one atta time but whatever floats your boat. It's super difficult to quit sugar, more than anything else you listed. Meditation is one of the best ways to discipline yourself. I wish you the best of luck!\n\nEdit: When it comes to food, I advise adding healthy foods instead of removing unhealthy ones. It's so much more manageable. For me, my goal is to eat a salad everyday and that already helps me curb unhealthy food. Just cutting sugar is a bit extreme and will be difficult but again I wish you the best of luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmqye4/giving_up_on_weed_alcohol_coffee_and_added_sugar/hcks0uq/"}
