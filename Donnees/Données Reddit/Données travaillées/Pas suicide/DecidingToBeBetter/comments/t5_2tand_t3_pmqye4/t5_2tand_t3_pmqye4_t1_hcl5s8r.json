If you're addicted, take your time; give it 6 months until it has become a habit not to drink. Use weed instead if you need to - in moderation, of course.\n\nThen switch the weed from smoking to eating. That will get rid of the smoking habit. Look up how to decarboxylate your weed by heating it in an oven or through some other process. Again, dropping the habit might take 6 months but I assume there's no rush.\n\nThen replace coffee with (very?) black tea. It will be similarly hot, bitter and you can add sugar if you like.\n\nThen, gradually reduce sugar in tandem with weed edibles. It really takes time to change your eating habits and taste preferences.\n\nThen drop the black tea, if you feel like it, or replace with less stimulating teas.\n\nI wouldn't rush this, if the goal is to do it sustainably and not relapse...\n\nEdit: You didn't mention a caffeine addiction, consider editing your post. I added it to the plan here :-)\n\nPS: I assume you've heard of /r/stopdrinking - it's amazing!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmqye4/giving_up_on_weed_alcohol_coffee_and_added_sugar/hcl5s8r/"}
