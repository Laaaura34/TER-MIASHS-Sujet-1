When I was young I also was teased about some parts of my appearance, actually by someone who shouldn't have done that, someone who should have been caring for me. It's incredibly hard to get over that, and maybe I never will. But most days now I don't think about it, so that's success.\n\nIt has also taught me that you should be kind to kids (maybe that is obvious to most people.. ), but really teasing a kid like this can have life long impacts. I always make sure to be encouraging and kind to kids. So that is the silver lining, that I can learn from my own experience and help other kids grow up to be happy and confident adults.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nionie/im_so_proud_of_myself_especially_when_i_look_back/gz46h1f/"}
