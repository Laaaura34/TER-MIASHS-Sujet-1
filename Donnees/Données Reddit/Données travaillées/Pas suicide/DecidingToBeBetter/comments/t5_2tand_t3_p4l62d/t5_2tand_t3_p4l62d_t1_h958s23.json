Even at my worst I would have never considered being violent.  I'm not excusing those acts at all, I'm only saying that there are people out there who will definitely cross that line when they are in withdrawal, I knew a few like that personally.  The solution for this is so simple it just blows my mind that the safe supply is not a thing in the US.  That's all I'm saying, is that those crimes wouldn't happen because people wouldn't be desperate.  Obviously there would be restrictions and requirements for getting in the program as well, you can't just go grab them lol\n\nI live in PA and it's not illegal to sell syringes but it's \"up to the discretion of the pharmacist/owner\" whether or not they want to sell them, and 90% of pharmacies will tell you no.  It's crazy.  Anyway I'm glad I don't live like that anymore, and I'm truly sorry about your mom, I'm sure she loved you immensely.  It's hard to understand if you've never been addicted but drugs completely rewired my brain and it was just like a constant feeling of extreme discomfort no matter how long I stayed clean.  It is so hard to break free from.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4l62d/i_robbed_a_walgreens_pharmacy_with_a_knife_and/h958s23/"}
