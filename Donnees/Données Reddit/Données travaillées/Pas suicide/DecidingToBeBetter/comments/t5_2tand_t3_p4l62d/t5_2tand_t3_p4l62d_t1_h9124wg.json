I'm on my phone now so I'll respond. The book is all finished. It took about 2.5 years, on and off. I had to continuously put it down and revisit it. It definitely slowed my own healing process, but I needed to see it through. The book is not lighthearted and was not done willy nilly.\n\nI've been sitting on the finished book now for a few months because I don't have a marketing instinct. I really just want to connect with people, not be a salesman. I just want to reach people and hear what they've been through. Only two or three days ago, I uploaded it to Amazon just to see how it felt. I think it's time to go. I feel good about it. It took me all day to figure it out though. Putting it up there was a huge relief. Sharing it with people is part of my healing process and I'm excited to finally take the next steps. But other than this message to you, I haven't told anyone about it yet. Thank you for posting and reaching out to me. Thank you also for the kind words.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4l62d/i_robbed_a_walgreens_pharmacy_with_a_knife_and/h9124wg/"}
