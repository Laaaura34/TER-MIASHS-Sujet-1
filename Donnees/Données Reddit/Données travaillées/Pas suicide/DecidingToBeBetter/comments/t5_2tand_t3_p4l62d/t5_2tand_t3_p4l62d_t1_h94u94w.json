I've read it several times today. I've been out here now for over 3 years without any trips back to the USA, and at some point since, I also started to see a lot of the negativity that goes on back home now. It just took getting away and stepping into a new culture to see it. It's amazing to me to see how other people from different countries live their daily lives, and you quickly realize that the way you've always known isnt the only way. This has been awesome. I hope to get to India soon, I love Indian food. I spent some time in Penang and started trying different Indian restaurants ever since. Thanks a lot, man. Hope all is well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4l62d/i_robbed_a_walgreens_pharmacy_with_a_knife_and/h94u94w/"}
