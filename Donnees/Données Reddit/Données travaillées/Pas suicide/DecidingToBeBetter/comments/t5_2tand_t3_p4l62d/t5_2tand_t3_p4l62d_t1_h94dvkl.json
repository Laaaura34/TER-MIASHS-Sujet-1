People are dying every day and people are robbing stores, homes and pharmacies trying to get their fix...just give it to them, for fucks sake...\"god forbid someone has access to clean, safe drugs and equipment to use in their own private residence, we would rather have them go out and rob their neighbors and kill themselves with research chemicals instead\".  The whole thing is a joke.  Along with pharmacies being able to deny a customer clean needles if they don't have a prescription.  Harm reduction has always been a good thing.  The only accomplishment made by not selling needles is more Hep C and HIV because people will always get high lol and that's just a fact of life.  Sorry for the rant.  I used to be an addict and I got my shit together now for the most part but my stance on this has not changed a bit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4l62d/i_robbed_a_walgreens_pharmacy_with_a_knife_and/h94dvkl/"}
