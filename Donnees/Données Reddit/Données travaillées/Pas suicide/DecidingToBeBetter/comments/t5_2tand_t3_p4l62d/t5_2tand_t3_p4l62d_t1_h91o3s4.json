Here's the answer: his family is rich.\n\nHe committed armed robbery as a drug addict, his parents paid his bail.  He did his time in a youth correctional facility in 2013 for five years when he was 18 in 2006.  Then he got his parole pardoned by the governor when he got out.   Then his parents rewarded him with a tour of Southeast Asia so he could \"find himself.\" \n\nI know we are anti-opiod and blame Big Pharma but this isn't a hero.  This is a basic rich douchebag.  This post is a great example of how Reddit takes the side of the poster with a sob story regardless of who they are and what they've done.  Where do you draw the line, reddit?  What if in his story he said a crazy conservative pulled a gun and he knew the bullets might accidentally hit others so he heroically stabbed the conservative 37 times accidentally?
