I\u2019m so honored to have read your post and grateful to you for sharing it with us. As a mom, I can\u2019t imagine the pride your father must feel every time you cross his mind (hundreds of times a day, I\u2019m sure). What every parent wants is to leave this earth one day knowing their children will be ok. Mistakes happen, people mess up, you\u2019ve learned and continue to grow everyday. You have given your Dad more than you will ever know. You have reminded the rest of us what humans are really capable of. Thank you, my friend. Keep up the amazing work!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4l62d/i_robbed_a_walgreens_pharmacy_with_a_knife_and/h913mdb/"}
