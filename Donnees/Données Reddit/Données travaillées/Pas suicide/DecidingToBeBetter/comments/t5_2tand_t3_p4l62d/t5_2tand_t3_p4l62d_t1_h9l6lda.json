As an addict were you worried about your child or children being addicts later in life? How did it start for your son? (Very sorry for your loss, I\u2019m not strong enough to even imagine). I\u2019m young but started young as well and as such was an addict for several years. I\u2019ve OD-Ed multiple times and am lucky to be alive. It took a lot of work to get out of that hole but I\u2019m in a good place now. I have an almost 8 month old daughter and I\u2019m scared to death that somehow she\u2019ll fall into addiction later because of my background. Addiction runs rampant in my family to include my own mom, uncles, and extended family (but not my husbands/ her dads at all) and it scares me to think she might be \u201cdestined\u201d for that path", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4l62d/i_robbed_a_walgreens_pharmacy_with_a_knife_and/h9l6lda/"}
