You assign significance to each of these cognitions, which strengthens the neural pathways in your brain, meaning they are more likely to recur.\n\n\nThe next time these thoughts occur, let them pass like clouds in the sky. Control your breathing. Feel the sensations in your body. Find somewhere pleasant and examine the environment around you in complete detail, every sight, sound, smell, and texture.\n\n\nIn this way, you are training your brain to escape from these pointless and self-reinforcing loops of negative thought. Sooner than you think, these cognitions will begin to subside and eventually the neural pathways become disused. \n\n\nUsing this technique I was able to stop my self-hatred (deeply ingrained from childhood), my suicidal thoughts, and much more. I now enjoy the pleasure of being able to recognise when I am starting to live inside my head too much, and I take the appropriate action to escape from the mental prison.\n\n\nGood luck.
