Maybe there\u2019s an underlining fear that A: you are afraid to show/own up to being the weird and flawed human we all are or B: there is not a lot of depth to you/the fear of coming across as boring. I\u2019m not really sure why either way, my two cents could be totally irrelevant. For me, there\u2019s an underlining sense of perfectionism under my desire to be liked, I don\u2019t want to be seen as flawed or weird, because that would mean I\u2019m not achieving the (unattainable) goal in my head of who I think I am. Maybe on some level you believe if you put on a good mask, other people won\u2019t be able to see your insecurities, or your pain. There could be a lot of reasons tbh. I think it starts with being completely honest with yourself and trying different things. Like see what happens if you don\u2019t say something during silence. You\u2019ll probably feel uncomfortable, but then you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re feeling. Maybe it\u2019s just insecurity that you haven\u2019t allowed yourself to fully feel, so you push it away and deny it instead of confronting it, I have no clue. But I know you will be able to find out, give yourself time and honesty.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c58eod/why_do_i_care_so_much_about_what_even_random/es09urt/"}
