Took me a long time to realize they\u2019re just drugs, and the real way out of depression is hard work and an intelligent therapist you can trust. But, that being said, antidepressants did lift my mood to the point where I was able to make it to therapy sessions and do the exercises. It depends on how you look at depression. I used to believe my depression was a chemical imbalance (a common belief) until I realized I was just using that as an excuse to not work hard\u2026 why work hard if it\u2019s just chemical and I can take drugs to solve my problems? Well that attitude didn\u2019t leave any room for personal growth and made my depression worse. So definitely take them if it helps you with discipline and motivation to improve, but don\u2019t expect them to cure you.
