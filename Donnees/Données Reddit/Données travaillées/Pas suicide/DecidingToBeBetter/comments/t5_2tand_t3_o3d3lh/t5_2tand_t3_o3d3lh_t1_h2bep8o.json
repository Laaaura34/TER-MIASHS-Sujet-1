Similar to above, I did not like how they made me feel, as it felt like I was sort of just existing. \nI went through three different types before deciding that they just weren't for me anymore. I just felt very false on them - as if the feelings I felt weren't quite my own.  \n\nThat, and I was no longer able to afford them after being taken off my mother's benefits. (This was before prescriptions became free to anyone under the age of 24 where I am.) \n\nNow that being said, just because they didn't work for me, doesn't mean they won't work for you. It may take some trial and error to find one that fits well, but if it's what you need then I do suggest giving them a go. \n\nI can fairly say that in time you may find other positive sources that work well to help you cope. Until then, I wish you the best of luck, and I'm proud you're taking the steps you need to help yourself. There's never any shame in needing aid in your mental health.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o3d3lh/23yo_male_with_depression_and_anxiety_have/h2bep8o/"}
