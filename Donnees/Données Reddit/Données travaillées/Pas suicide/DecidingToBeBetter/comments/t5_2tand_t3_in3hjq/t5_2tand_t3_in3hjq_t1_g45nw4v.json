That's when I try to indulge in something relaxing and/or pleasantly distracting. Watch a move, read a book, journal, doodle, color, write a letter to a friend, write, play a game, etc. Or if there's something you've been putting off, that's a good time to do it, whether it's cleaning house or showering. Doing something productive, either for work or pleasure, is the key through getting through Sundays. \n\nAlso, don't beat yourself up so much. 75% is a good number! No one can operate at 100% all day everyday. If you feel that you struggle to relax or feel guilty if you do or if you have anxiety in general, you might consider seeing a therapist.\n\n\nHope that helps \ud83d\udc95", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/in3hjq/how_do_you_deal_with_sunday_evening_blues_i_need/g45nw4v/"}
