A co-worker actually hugged me, held me a few seconds. That meant a lot to me. (I never went back.)\n\nAfter my first counseling sessions, I started to rethink what \"friend\" meant to me. Friendship doesn't have to fit a strict set of rules (which I don't know anyway). What a revelation.\n\nAlong with everything else you're feeling, I imagine there could be a huge sense of relief.\n\nGood going.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/euwqbw/i_went_to_get_therapy_counselling_in_the_first/ffsdzt6/"}
