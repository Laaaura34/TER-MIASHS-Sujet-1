I tried counselling for the first time last year, I didn't know what to expect or what would happen. I was referred by my employer to the work counsellor.\nI was at such a low ebb, off work, I hadn't slept for weeks, wasn't eating, couldn't leave the house, that I was willing to try anything.\nI can say honestly, I don't think counselling solved my problems or 'cured' my depression, but it did give me a place where I could talk through my problems freely and without judgement. Where I could get things straight in my head and sometimes, that's what you need.\nI wouldn't expect counselling to have a instantaneous effect or be a magic pill to make everything better, but stick with it and in my own experience, it helps take the weight off you and allows you breathing space, which is what I found most beneficial.\nGood luck, I wish you all the best and hope that you start feeling better soon.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/euwqbw/i_went_to_get_therapy_counselling_in_the_first/ffs4ifd/"}
