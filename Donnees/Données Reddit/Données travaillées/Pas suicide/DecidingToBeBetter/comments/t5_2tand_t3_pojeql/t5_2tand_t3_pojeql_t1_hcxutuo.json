It will be difficult but it would be very fulfilling. \n\nI started my journey at the start of the pandemic at 23 years old and I'm already so much closer to the vision that I have for my best self. I'm healthier and happier.\n\nAlso, remember to take nobody's sh*t. You are who you make yourself to be. Things can always get better if only you want them to and you work towards that direction.
