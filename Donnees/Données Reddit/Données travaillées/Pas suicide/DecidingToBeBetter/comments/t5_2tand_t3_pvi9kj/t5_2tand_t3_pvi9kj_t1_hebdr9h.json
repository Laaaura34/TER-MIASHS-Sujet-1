Being #1 is actually more specific than \"succeeding\". So set goals of getting a certain grade, learning a certain skill, taking a certain class. Getting into certain programs, fields, whatever. Specific stuff. Then when you get those goals (like I dunno, getting into med school) you can fine tune them. Getting the residency you want, getting a job at a certain hospital, whatever. Going for band? Getting a solo. Playing a sport? Being the best at your position, or even beating your personal best. You can reach a specific goal because it is spelled out. \"Succeeding\" is kind of vague so you will never reach it and never be satisfied.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvi9kj/how_do_i_deal_with_my_envy_issues/hebdr9h/"}
