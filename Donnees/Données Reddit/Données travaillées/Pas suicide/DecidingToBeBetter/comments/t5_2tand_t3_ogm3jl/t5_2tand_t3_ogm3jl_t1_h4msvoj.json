We want to do something and our subconscious mind is like \u201cyeah we\u2019ve tried this before, it ain\u2019t gonna happen\u201d. We\u2019ve programmed ourselves to believe we wont follow through which just causes perpetual cycles which reinforce the belief. If you were one of my coaching clients i would tell you to start with ONE thing (reading, working out, walking, positive affirmations...etc) and do that thing for 5 minutes a day (absolutely no more or less time than that) and do that for 2 weeks straight without fail. If you\u2019ve completed that successfully then go on to 10 minutes for two weeks and at that point I would speak with you and reevaluate the game plan. This exercise will help you win your word back to yourself so that when you say you\u2019re going to do something, there\u2019s no second guessing in your mind that you will do it because it\u2019s WHO YOU ARE. This is really about becoming a person of action and I believe you can do it, WIN DAILY. God bless!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogm3jl/i_want_to_change_so_bad/h4msvoj/"}
