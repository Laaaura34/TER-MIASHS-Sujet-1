I\u2019ve made the mistake of mis-prioritizing my tasks and thinking I was doing fine because I was staying busy, but after a couple years I realized that I was not going the direction that I wanted to. So yeah just make sure you know which one of those big dreams is most important, put those tasks near the top of the list (along with just basic life maintenance stuff like laundry/cooking because well, you have to do those), and you\u2019re good to go.\n\nBest of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogm3jl/i_want_to_change_so_bad/h4l70nd/"}
