The funniest thing about not shaving my armpits is how many younger women I meet who see my armpits, excitedly say \u201cYou don\u2019t shave your armpits!\u201d and then show me their armpits too\u2014 like we\u2019re part of a secret club or like she\u2019s amazed and delighted to have spotted another of her kind in the wild. It\u2019s weird but also sweet how many people are happy for you, like you\u2019re being extraordinarily courageous by choosing to wear a tank top in 90 degree heat and daring not to shave. Obviously there are those who are offended by the mere idea, but I\u2019ve never been bothered by that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p877co/i_22_f_decided_to_stop_shaving/h9qn4ic/"}
