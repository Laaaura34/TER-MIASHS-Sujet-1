They don't come out of a positive concern for others.\n\nIt's all MY feelings and MY fears dictate what MY life is like (no matter the impact on those around us).\n\nPeople don't want to cop to this because THEY will feel bad and be challenged to change.\n\nThis leads directly to another hypothesis that all insanity is simply dishonesty. Rationalising and justifying things that simply aren't true to get what we think we want in the moment.\n\nThe antidote is ruthless honesty and making an effort to consider others and do things that are, as much as possible, for them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mch6nv/think_im_a_covert_narcissist/gs5vfsb/"}
