And catch an attitude when you stand up for yourself. I am thinking \"whatever, you pay me this amount of money, and during the time I am working for you I give 110%, STOP EXPECTING ME TO GIVE YOU MORE THAN THAT!!! I come in do my job right and never have any issues. Why do I have to sacrifice more?\n\nJobs, especially these kind of jobs (fast food, grocery stores, etc) always expect you to be open and willing for everything. Ha, the moment I get sick and I'm out for a week, you are already looking for a replacement. Why should I kill myself and make myself sick, just for you to disregard me when I am of no use?!?! I am really liking the new standard for employees such as myself: yeah, I am easily replaceable to this company, but you're kind of company is easily replaceable to my employment. Internally, this is becoming more noticeable on their end (especially with covid).
