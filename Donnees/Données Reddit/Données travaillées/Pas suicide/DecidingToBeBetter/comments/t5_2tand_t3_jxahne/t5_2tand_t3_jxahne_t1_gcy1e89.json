I had this attitude that I was in the wrong so I'd be trying to avoid potential conflicts. And I think it showed, like a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nFor example, it was super easy for someone to convince me that I'm selfish because I didn't really have that sense of what it means to be selfish beyond \u2018if it benefits me more = selfish'. Example, agreeing to work on Christmas day for no extra pay after being pressured just because I don't have a big family and we celebrate on another day.  I should be lucky to have a job, I owe them. Yeah, it doesnt work like that lol! Nor did it make anyone at that job like me any more.\n\n It could go the other way too, I'd think \u2018enough people pleasing!\u2019 and  I didn't consider anyone else unless it was in my interest. Now there is more room for nuance.\n\n The, ability to communicate differs between people and depends on the dynamic. Just because it's awkward with one person, it doesn't mean it's like that with everyone. Those \u2018friends but not really' and that shitty job are not missed from my life.\n\nBut finally, I'll say you need to consider the power and support dynamics. Some people do have to put up with shitty people at work or family, especially if you have a history of not enforcing boundaries.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jxahne/steps_to_get_rid_of_the_peoplepleasing_syndrome/gcy1e89/"}
