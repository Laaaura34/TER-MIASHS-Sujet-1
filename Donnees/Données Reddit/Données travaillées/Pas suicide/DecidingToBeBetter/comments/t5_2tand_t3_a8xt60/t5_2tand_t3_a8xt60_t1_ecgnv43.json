The other thing I get from reading this is you've let your world define who you are. You keep yourself tied to this story that you're a waste, that your sister is right about you, that everyone does things for you, you can't do anything for yourself. You reaffirm this a lot in your post. You're really tied to this story of who you are but you know you have options and that it's almost an imperative to trudge a new path.\n\nI'd recommend Jordan Peterson's book \"12 Rules for Life\"  and/or David Goggins \"Can't Hurt Me\"  ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecgnv43/"}
