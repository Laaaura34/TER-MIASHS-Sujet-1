I also was someone who chose to stay close to home, sometimes lived at home after college due to financial necessity, but it really wasn't healthy.  My sister at one time lived in the same building as my mother, but ended up spending much of her time with her, eating most of her meals with her, and became less and less independent.  My mother eventually had a stroke and had to go into a nursing home which was devastating to my sister as well as my mother.  \n\n\nYou have a lot of positives in your life, you seem intelligent, have a good job, but make no mistake, you're living in a toxic environment and need to get out.  \n\n\nYour parents have an unhealthy attachment to you and at this point it only benefits them and not you.  My opinion: you need to get into therapy as soon as possible to figure out how to extricate yourself from this situation.  And you need to set boundaries.  Don't go to hang out at their house all the time.  You're not a kid anymore.  Sure have dinner with them, but no more than once a week.  \n\n\nFind healthy activities you enjoy in real life (not on the computer) with real people.  If you find ways to fill up your life with people and things that spark passion in you, you won't need to spend so much time with your family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for relationships, that will happen if you first work on yourself.  Don't worry about how well other people seem to be doing, and don't feel old.  My serious relationships came much later than my friends' did.  I'm much older than you.  Trust me, you're young and have lots of potential.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecfvpuh/"}
