When I get depressed, helping a random stranger cheers me. There are so many older people who never get visitors. There are so many older people in your neighborhood who need a heavy box lifted but have no one to lift it, or a lightbulb changed that they can no longer reach. There are people in hospice or nursing homes who could derive great joy from a musician coming and playing for them or just interacting with them and caring they exist. So many elders feel and are forgotten by a world that tells them they become less relevant as they age. Help even one forgotten elder and you've improved the world dramatically. When in doubt, go do something kind for a stranger. Even if your action is the only proof you have that there is kindness and good in this world, then let your actiond be that proof. While there is suffering that can be eased with kindness, there is work yet to do. Make the world better one smiling heart at a time. Eventually, your heart will smile with them.
