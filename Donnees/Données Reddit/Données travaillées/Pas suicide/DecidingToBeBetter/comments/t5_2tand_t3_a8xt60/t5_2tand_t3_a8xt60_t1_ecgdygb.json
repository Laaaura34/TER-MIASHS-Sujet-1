But at least in your post, it doesn't sound like that's something that gives you what you need.\n\nWhat do you care about? What makes you itch? This is the crucial question you need to figure out first. (This doesn't have to be your purpose in life. Just something you really like doing).\n\nYou still have plenty of time. And you will experience all the important feelings that you think you have missed out on (like your first love). All the best for your journey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecgdygb/"}
