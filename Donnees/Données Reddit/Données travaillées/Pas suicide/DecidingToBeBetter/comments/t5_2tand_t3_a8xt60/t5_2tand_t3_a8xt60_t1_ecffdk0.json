I\u2019m roughly the same age but similar situation, living on my own close to parents and seeing them all the time.  I have a job that pays well that I really enjoy but it\u2019s still just a distraction from that I\u2019m basically unhappy when I\u2019m not at work. \n\nWhat helped me is volunteering at an animal shelter walking dogs. I didn\u2019t have to talk to anyone and could spend as much time outside walking an animal who appreciates you. I eventually got a dog and my parents were able to help me with it when I\u2019m working long hours. Just a thought I guess, but it\u2019s helped me meet people and spend more time outside.
