You said you would spend a lot of time reading about that or even watching other people on YouTube play. You should get into music a lot more. Stop thinking. Do. It\u2019s never too late to be where you want to be. If you love music that much, go for it. It\u2019s not all about a high paying job to be happy as you\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s about loving what you do no matter how much you get paid. Go ahead and take that risk of involving yourself more in music because hey from what I see I feel that you would enjoy that. You can do anything you set your mind to. It\u2019s surprising how much people can do if they made something their #1 priority.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecfjfl7/"}
