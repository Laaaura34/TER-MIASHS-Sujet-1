It may be later than others, but life isn\u2019t a race, it\u2019s a journey and a very personal one at that. I can attest that I know many unmarried single females (and males) in your age range. \n\nThis may be repetitive bc some others have already mentioned them but my suggestions:\n\nTalk to a therapist. They can help talk you through some of your frustrations and guide you towards actionable next steps. \n\nTake a risk. I noticed you mentioned wanting to do a few things but then using a potential negative outcome as a reason not to pursue it. Sometimes failure is a good thing. It teaches us wisdom and experience. \n\nNo one knows what they want to be, what they want to do or if they\u2019ll really like something. The only way to know is to try. And fail. Then try again. And fail. And again. \n\nThe scary is unknown but most people walk around half scared, paranoid and worried. When you do something new, you run into those people and bond over the unknown initially. Then, over the familiar. Next thing you know you have friends. \n\nI also suggest you moving further away from your parents and visit them less, taper it off.
