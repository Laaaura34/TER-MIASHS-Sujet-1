Every day. Something that will make your life better. \n\nYou've got the means to make good changes in your life, but a whole lifestyle change doesn't happen overnight. Maybe today you find a cooking class to sign up for. Look for a band to join. Tidy your garage. Invite your parents to dinner at your place instead of eating at theirs. Start giving yourself an hour internet-free before bed (read a book or something instead).\n\nThey can be big things or little. Maybe today you don't feel like going to the gym, but today is gym day and you suck it up and go anyway, that's your one thing. Or maybe today you book a week away somewhere, get away from your situation, give yourself time to think, and also have a new experience, explore somewhere new, maybe do new things. \n\nEither way, every day just do *one* positive thing. Eventually things will improve. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecfa4xe/"}
