The first thing that came to mind as I was reading this is that you really need to do some travelling and especially travel to a place where people are really suffering and don't anyone to take care of them or help them. You are living with an incredible amount of privilege (I hate that word but it's the word that came to mind) and although your parents didn't encourage to spread your wings, that's pretty much what seems to be holding you back. Too much coddling and trying to keep you close. My parents try to keep me extremely close and gave me no freedom and treated me like a slave when I was a kid, Despite fighting tooth and nail to have a better life I'm sick and disabled now, have no job, am quickly running out of savings, no friends, no family, and I'm 38 years old. So to see that you are only 30 years old, have a loving family, jobs that pay a lot of money and an otherwise clean slate is extremely lucky. You got through school on your own and it got you the career you have, you moved out and achieved that, but you seem to be living in fear and apathy about life. What I'm saying is that you can achieve anything you want. And your parents will eventually get used to it. This is why I think before you do anything else, you need to do some serious travelling, maybe backpacking, or at least go somewhere for a few weeks. It sounds like you can afford it. I think it will give you greater perspective.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecfht2o/"}
