You have to get out there and just be. Dont have expectations or a grand old story in your head. Simplify things.  If you want to meet women, get a dating app (bumble), research what a good dating profile looks like. \n\nDont focus on your past. That shit is over. Learn from what worked and didnt work. What do you want to be and go shape yourself to be that way. Trust me. Most people are dissatisfied with their lives. All my married friends tell me not to get married. Which I was probabably never going to do any way but if you want that go and get it. \n\nThere is no exact way to be. We fall into this fallacy that we need to be married,  have kids, etc. But its not true. Go do what you want to do (as long as you're not hurting anyone). And DON'T compare your life to others. Trust me. Delete social media even if you have to. \n\nYou will fail so many times before you get there. Just don't jump to conclusions about people and keep on moving forward.\n\nIf you want some books to read, hit me up. \n\nGoodluck and Merry Christmas\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecgw0vv/"}
