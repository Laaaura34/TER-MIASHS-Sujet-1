Sounds like you got some money saved up. So you can take a few months off.\n\nGo abroad. If you speak English, head for Australia or New Zealand. Try to cross the country once, east to west or north to south. Stay in backpacker hostels. Stay in at least 6 person mixed dorms. Hang around the common area, look friendly, ask where people are from, what they have seen during their trip. See what happens. Make friends or don't. Go with the flow. No pressure.\n\nTry wwoofing during your trip. \nhttp://wwoof.net\nIt's volunteering on small organic farms. You will meet nice people. You will learn some skills.\n\nMix up your hostel stays with 1 or 2 days of couch surfing in each city. Try to find hosts who you find interesting. It's about getting the locals perspective.\nhttps://www.couchsurfing.com\n\nBasically you need to put yourself in harms way in the safest possible way. \n\nYour mission is to have an open mind, smile, be friendly, take no offence. Collect as many impressions of people as possible. Collect stories. Stories you can use when meeting new people.\n\nIt's a numbers game. You are meeting as many people as possible from as many different backgrounds as possible. Sooner or later you will have matches. You will find friends, and more.\n\nThis will boost your confidence. More confidence means more friends. This you can bring back home or to wherever you decide to go next.\n\nGo get em. You have the power.\n\n:)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecgzc4b/"}
