You will be able to talk to someone who knows how to help you.\n\nAsk yourself whether you want a relationship or in reality you want one just because everybody else is one. Considering you are 30 and with zero experience, saying you would not date a divorced woman with a kid is just stupid but I am not going to get into that. Also not every woman over 30 has been married or have kids. Just saying. But of course how could you know when you have no social life.\n\nMove as far as you can from your parents. They are not doing you a favour. At all. Their behaviour is just as problematic as yours.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecfyz1w/"}
