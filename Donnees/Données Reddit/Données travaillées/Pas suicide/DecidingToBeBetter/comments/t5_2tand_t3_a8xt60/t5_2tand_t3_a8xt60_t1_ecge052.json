What really needs to change is, your social life. Very! Being around people of same tastes gives every single thing you feel you are missing on. The first effort is, making friends! Yeah, it might sound tough to meet people with similar tastes but you know your way around the Internet so that shouldn't be hard. Meet up with one of them. You can go to conventions if you want and Im sure comments down here have suggested better ways. The 2nd thing when you have friends is, you need to make an effort to savour you friendship(you'll know when a relation is worth it and you'll make an effort. So no specific Trips on making and savouring friends. Tip: Read related books) Once you have friends you have everything. Now you have good friends, you will probably start hang in out with them. This way you will eventually leave your folks' house.\nSo this is what I mean when I say focusing on your social life alone will sort your life.\nAnd yeah about your career, you have all the knowledge you need. Trust me! You just need to find out your interest, then find related study material and courses(this is what most of the people do) then give yourself a time of 1 year(max) and then it's time to show off your skill set. This way you'll enjoy your job too. :-)\nYou're going to be awesome, buddy! Trust me! You'll have a nice family life, nice career and that sense of satisfaction every man hunts in his/her life. :-)\nHappy life!
