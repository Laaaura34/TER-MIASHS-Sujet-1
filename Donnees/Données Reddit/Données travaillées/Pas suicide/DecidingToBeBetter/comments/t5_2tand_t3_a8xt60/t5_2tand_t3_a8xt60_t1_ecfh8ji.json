Move. As far as possible from your parents. They do everything for you like you said. Since that's the biggest problem, move at least 3 states away. Out of the country would be even better but as far as you possibly can. With all the money you saved up, this should not be too big of a problem. The new setting will inspire you, trust me. \n\nFriends are extremely hard to make, I agree. So I can't tell ya much about that. Hopefully in your next job you meet people, as well as the new city/town/country you move to. \n\nRelationships should come last, since you feel so lost and jaded. Right now is the time to figure out what you want from life, then move on from there. People don't want to date someone who doesn't even know themselves. I can relate, and Im trying to figure it all out too. Good luck man!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecfh8ji/"}
