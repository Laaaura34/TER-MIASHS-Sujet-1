Currently sophomore in high school. I\u2019ve currently been through that electronic music/guitar thing (even though it\u2019s currently dying down a bit). A couple of years ago I was probs playing video games for 6hrs/day, and with just a handful of friends.\n\nReally everyone I deal with in high school on a daily basis, are just acquaintances, and bc the volume/dynamic of the class, I don\u2019t really have the chance to come with or really say anything interesting. I often just find myself drowning away. I also usually just go home and never go with anyone.  \n\nI feel that I\u2019ve never really experienced anything sizable. It\u2019s a dreadful feeling, the dispair and claustrophobia. The first verse of \u201cmind playing tricks on me\u201d by Geto boys is about that. With Scarface feeling trapped in a room with the walls closing in on him. \n\nYour post, as well as the replies have been an important wake-up-call. Even if nobody\u2019s gonna see this, and it\u2019s just is a vague rant, I needed to get this of my chest. I also have to keep in mind that I (and you) have plenty of time to turn things around, even if there are no immediate changes, and that consistency and mindset matter just as much as physical and social merits.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecgqvx6/"}
