I wouldn't call being social online is a waste of time if you enjoy it. Many \"normies\" spend their time doing much more meaningless things.\n\nIf I were you, I would quit my job and travel around the world or study a completely new field (that's what I did). If it doesn't work, you can always find a new job in the software industry. You don't really have anything to lose. Time is the most valuable asset.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAnd as everyone else suggests: Therapy, meditation and don't live close to your parents.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecg7fjf/"}
