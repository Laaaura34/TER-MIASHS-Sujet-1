I have mine on a Google spreadsheet so I can access it anywhere. It will change your life when you actually put down in writing what you want out of this life. And believe me you will delete/change many items in the process. They can be tangible things, travel destinations, experiences, personal goals etc. \n\nAs for women and friends, focus on becoming the person you want to be, then go into highly sociable places like trivia nights, community events on your community calendar etc. I promise if you put on a smile and keep attending these events you will meet people.\n\nLearn to fake it 'til you make it. Visualize the kind of person who want to be and believe in your hearts that you have already achieved it. The law of attraction really does work.\n\nFeel free to PM me.\n\nPeace\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ech3pmz/"}
