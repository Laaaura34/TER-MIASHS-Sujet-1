You might benefit from cultivating true independence as well as your musical talents. Try doing something like learning to cook, learning how to do laundry, etc. for half an hour a few days a week until you can do everything your parents have been doing for you until now. Also, you have the money, so why not try creating your own music? Why not try pursuing it as a side hustle and see where it takes you? Upload your music to Soundcloud, YouTube, Bandcamp, etc. just for the hell of it. Little by little, experiment with different hobbies/activities that don't require a computer so you create a healthy balance between your time spent online and your time spent on your passions. I hope this helps at least a little!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecf48z5/"}
