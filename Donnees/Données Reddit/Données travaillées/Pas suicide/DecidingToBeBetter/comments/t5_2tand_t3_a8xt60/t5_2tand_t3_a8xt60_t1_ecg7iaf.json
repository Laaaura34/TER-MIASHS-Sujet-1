If you have more guts, look for a job or internship abroad and LIVE abroad for some time. I have done that myself and it was by far my best exeprience. It boosted my self-esteem so much. Maybe you fit into other cultures much better. At least you will be out of your routine and you will need to interact with ppl. And whenever you are from abroad, ppl are more open and curious. Distance matters in my opinion. The farther you go, the more free and independent you will feel.\nAlso, your life doesn't sound so bad at all (unless there is sth very bad at the end I didnt read - sorry). You got a degree, you got a job, you got a loving family, you got a home and you got a lot of savings which open opportunities. Not having a gf with 30 - so what! Hey, there are many singles with 30. You can also date girls in their 20s, can't you - even more choice ;). I know life is a struggle but I see you have a some good ressources. Don't give up yet! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecg7iaf/"}
