Not to meet girls, not to learn how to bake but to get away from your comfort zone. It's different from your usual gaming and it's fun if you put your mind into it.\n\nOne step outside your everyday life that depresses you might show you that there's a bigger world out there and it's not too difficult to explore it. It could be anything from a new hobby to volunteer work because it seems that you are trying to find meaning. You won't find it in a new girlfriend or a new house.
