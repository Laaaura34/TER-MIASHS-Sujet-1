Unfortunately with smart phones and social media, everyone suffers to some extent of the same thing you\u2019re going through. Go easy on yourself. You\u2019re young and have so many opportunities. I would politely suggest a phone-free meditation retreat. No internet, no parents to reach out to, just you finding some peace of mind. Use that PTO to let yourself really feel the full extent of your isolation without internet acquaintances who are poor companions compared to real life relationships.  When you face it all head on, I think you could become closer to finding some joy. There\u2019s so much to see and do beyond a screen. You deserve to enjoy it all.
