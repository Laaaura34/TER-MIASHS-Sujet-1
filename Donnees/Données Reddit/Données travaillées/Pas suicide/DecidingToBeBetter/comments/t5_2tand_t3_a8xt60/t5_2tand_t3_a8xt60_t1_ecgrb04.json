It will always try to do things the easiest way, or simply not do it. \nBut you ultimately have the control of yourself, first, grab some paper and a pen, then write everything you want to do. Rate them by the simplicity and feasibility. Do things one by one, wanna cook for example? Check some simple recipes on the internet and buy the ingredients, you may also want to cook for your parents as well. \nI really believe that you lack the taste of achievement, and self-esteem to an extent. The others are the others and you are you. The only person you may want to compare with is the past self (the you X time ago). Check your status, just like in games and see where you can progress.
