Perhaps get your mental health treated with therapy or meds. Get a regular commitment, such as a sports league or art class. I'd really recommend a weekly volunteering commitment like tutoring or helping at an animal shelter. If you volunteer on Saturdays you can try to make that a day you don't go to your parents, or at least not all day. As hard as it is, you're gonna have to embrace being alone sometimes. It'll be really healthy for you to enjoy being alone and with your own company sometimes. Take yourself out for a movie, coffee, a meal, shopping, etc. Your life is not wasted and you have plenty going on that will allow you to move onward and upward. Let me know if you want to chat more. Give us an update. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecgjs6m/"}
