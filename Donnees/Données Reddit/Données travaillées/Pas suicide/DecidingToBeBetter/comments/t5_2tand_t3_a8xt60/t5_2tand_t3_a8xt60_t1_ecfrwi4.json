What would you do if you won the lottery? Do THAT. Did you know there are people that call themselves \u201cdigital nomads\u201d and travel the world with only a suitcase, living in whichever city/country they please, for as long as they like? They work entirely online, usually as freelance programmers. There\u2019s a huge group (and growing) of full-time travelers here in the US as well. Many of them live in really nice RVs or customized vans with all the comforts of home. They travel and go where they want and stay as long as they like. Some have full-time remote jobs and some are self-employed. \n\nMaybe you need the routine of the office and going to your parents\u2019 every night. I would guess that getting way outside your comfort zone would be really good for you. If you did decide to travel, there\u2019s nothing saying you can\u2019t go back home if you tire of it. Some of the people I follow on YouTube have been at it for years and they don\u2019t plan to ever stop, others decided to go home and there\u2019s nothing wrong with either decision. \n\nAs an alternative, have you ever considered getting a dog? They force you to go outside and interact with people. Get a yellow lab or a golden retriever, you can\u2019t go wrong!
