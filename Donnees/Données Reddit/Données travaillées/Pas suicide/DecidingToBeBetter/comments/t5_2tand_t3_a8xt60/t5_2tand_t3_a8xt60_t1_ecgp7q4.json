I'm 23 and I've spend all those years to play video games, being lonely, no friends, no girlfriends, no activities. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut after smth happened to me i've made some decisions to try being a better person, change bad habits to good and I've joined an association to help poor peoples in the street, it keeps me busy the week end and it forces me to talk with others, men&women. It feels pretty good and i think it's a good thing, I will keep this and hope it will help me better with myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that being lonely can kill you, we are humans and the best thing to do is to being connected with others and find more happiness in this world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you will be doing better and count the blessings you got you'll see that there's many of them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecgp7q4/"}
