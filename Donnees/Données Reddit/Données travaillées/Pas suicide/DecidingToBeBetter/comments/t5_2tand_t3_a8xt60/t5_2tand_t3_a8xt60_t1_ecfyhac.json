And since it looks like recreational marijuana is going to be a thing in Illinois soon, why not try a bit of weed or some edibles, to open up your mind in a different way?\n\nI love doing a mild amount of edibles, it motivates me to do stuff I\u2019d rather not do, like housework. I also get some legit insites into my human condition, how I got here, and where I\u2019d like to be going. And you already know music, I know for a fact cannabis helps with creativity. \n\nAnyway, just a thought. You really should look into a therapist. Find one who is into Cognitive/Behavioral therapy. They tend to be shorter term than traditional therapy, and work more at dealing with your current issues and changing things you don\u2019t like, rather than digging into your past. You can certainly discuss your past with a CBT based therapist if you want, however. \n\nAnyway, good luck to you. You have a lot more going for yourself than you realize. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecfyhac/"}
