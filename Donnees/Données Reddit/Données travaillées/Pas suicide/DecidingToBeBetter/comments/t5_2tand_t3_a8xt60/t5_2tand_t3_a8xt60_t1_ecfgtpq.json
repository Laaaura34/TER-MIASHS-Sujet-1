Take a travel sized guitar. The world has much more possibility than you can imagine. But to ever learn to be with people well, you\u2019ll have to step off the side lines and begin to play. Give yourself a lot of kindness as you grow, but stay fierce about learning to build connections in real life. Investigate intimacy, authentic relating, communication, personal development. Find people who are also looking to be more connectable. Take classes, go to adult sleepaway camp, learn tantra, sign up for a men\u2019s course. It\u2019s not just possible to create a fulfilling life - it\u2019s the most fun you\u2019ll ever have. Ask yourself - is the choice I\u2019m making generative or depleting? Anything that drains you instead of filling you up has to go. Being brave is how you\u2019ll get everything you want. Vulnerability is the ultimate freedom. Wishing you the best on your journey!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecfgtpq/"}
