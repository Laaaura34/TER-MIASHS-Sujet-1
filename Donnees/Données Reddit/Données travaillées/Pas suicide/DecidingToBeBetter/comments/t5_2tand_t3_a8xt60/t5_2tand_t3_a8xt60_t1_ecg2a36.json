Expectation is a burden. Where you are is perfect! Spending time at your family is wonderful. Enjoy them cause they won\u2019t be around forever!\nYou are healthy, you have money! That is great!!!! \n \nWhat do you like to do, what do you enjoy besides gaming? Do that once a month.  Keep it simple! \nAs others suggested, volunteer, travel, join a meetup group!\n\nHow about getting one of those travel deals with planned itineraries. Give it a shot. Do a two day travel. \nMan you are in a beautiful place, it seems like your expectations are what\u2019s burdening you. Try meditation. It does wonders!
