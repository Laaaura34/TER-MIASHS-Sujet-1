But I think I'm at that tipping point, and I hope you are too. And when you reach the edge, I hope you choose not to jump. Remember that you have something remarkable to share with this world. We all discover what that is at different points in our lives. We owe it to ourselves though, and to the world, to afford ourselves as many opportunities as possible to reveal as much as we can. \n\nI used to be so scared to leave the house even because I was afraid of doing something wrong, messing up - that I didn't know how to live on my own or to take care of myself.
