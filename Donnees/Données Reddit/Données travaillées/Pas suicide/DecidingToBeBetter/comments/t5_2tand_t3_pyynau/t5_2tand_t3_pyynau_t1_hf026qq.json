LOTS of medication changes until my doc finally found one that worked. It took a long time, lots of patience I didn\u2019t really have, and yes could be quite expensive without insurance. But quite frankly, when you find the right combination of therapy and medicine\u2026my life did a complete 180. I feel like there\u2019s so much more meaning to this life and that I really want to experience it, explore what I desire, who I am\u2026something I never felt since I was at least 17 (probably even younger then that). \n\nKeep trying. I know how hard and deflating it can be when it doesn\u2019t work, but as someone who has had hard-to-treat depression, you truly do not have to feel the way you\u2019ve been feeling. \n\nWhen you find a therapist who you feel like really understands you or wants to (this may take a few sessions to figure out), stick with them. Don\u2019t worry about the \u201cmethod\u201d they use for therapy, just that you have a good rapport\u2014in other words connection\u2014with them, that you trust them. And then trust them. Open yourself up, mention what you\u2019ve mentioned in this post, how you really feel, how in the past things haven\u2019t helped, and asked them if they think they can help you. Therapy isn\u2019t easy. It requires opening up to, essentially a stranger, in ways you may not even realize you\u2019ve been closing yourself off. The emotions you feel that might be buried under years of numbness suddenly coming out or just the idea of being vulnerable with your deepest intimate thoughts can be scary. But you won\u2019t get better if you don\u2019t share them and stick it out. Tell your psychiatrist what medications you\u2019ve taken in the past and what the side effects were and that they didn\u2019t seem to help. If they prescribe you something that doesn\u2019t seem to be working, or that makes you too tired, tell them what\u2019s going on! They can always try something else. \n\nAfter being prescribed the \u201cright\u201d medication for me, which again took years of trials and failures, it still took about two months/8 weeks for me to actually see the results. Other people noticed I seemed different but I didn\u2019t feel all that different for a couple of months. I was able to keep taking it though because I didn\u2019t have significant side effects, in fact the only real side effect was that I seemed to have a bit more energy. I\u2019m taking 150mg of Wellbutrin XL. It may not work for you, but it might be something you bring up to a psychiatrist if you haven\u2019t tried it before. Only anti-depressant I\u2019ve ever been on where I didn\u2019t feel extremely fatigued/tired. \n\nI really hope the best for you OP. I know what living with a rain cloud above your head for years feels like but I also know that with the right therapy and medication, I can have sunny days now too and that I deserve them. I hope you find your sunny days even if it seems like you can\u2019t find them now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyynau/i_cant_give_meaning_to_my_life_nothing_interests/hf026qq/"}
