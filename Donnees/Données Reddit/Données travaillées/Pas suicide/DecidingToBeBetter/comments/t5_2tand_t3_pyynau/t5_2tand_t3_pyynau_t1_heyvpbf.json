Life is meaningless (non-existent actually). And if you go deep enough in anything to find a meaning, you'll realise there is none. And it's okay to not see meaning in anything, it is an expression of self-discovery.\n\nThat being said other commentors have a point. It seems you've been depressed for a long time or haven't found an interest or hope that tickles your fancy in a sustainable way.\n\nIt could be because of using your addictions as a substitute for interest. 15 years, I suppose you've tried a lot of things. \n\nIf I may suggest, allow yourself to be blank for a long period. A few weeks at least. Keep yourself off of pleasuresome stimulus and takeon some basic healthy practices like taking in sunlight and eating simple. You will find a muse, or rather a muse will find you.\n\nLife is meaningless doesn't mean it can't be interesting", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyynau/i_cant_give_meaning_to_my_life_nothing_interests/heyvpbf/"}
