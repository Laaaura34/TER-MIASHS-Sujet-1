I ruled them all out when my first try didn\u2019t magically fix me. Years later, I have found a class of drugs and dosage that takes the edge off the depression. Start with writing up which drugs you\u2019ve been on and which side effects made you hate them. It\u2019s good that you will advocate for yourself by declining a treatment that doesn\u2019t help. Use that to help negotiate with a doctor for other options. \n\nYou mention you have an addiction but not to what. It kind of doesn\u2019t matter, because addictive substances will rearrange your brain chemistry. Alcohol has been my depression\u2019s ride or die. I don\u2019t mean this to sound flippant at all, but please address your addiction. It is 100% a factor. It\u2019s also probably caused by the core reason you\u2019re depressed. It gets to be an invisible cycle.\n\nFor whatever it\u2019s worth, I am diagnosed with a handful of mood disorders and a personality disorder. Progress has been slow, invisible most of the time until I look back. But when I look back, the accumulated progress is huge. \n\nTL;DR: Many people feel the way you do. Antidepressants cover a huge range of drug types and classes, be specific about what you don\u2019t like to guide your doctor. Never by shy about asking for help. You are loved.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyynau/i_cant_give_meaning_to_my_life_nothing_interests/hexvwwx/"}
