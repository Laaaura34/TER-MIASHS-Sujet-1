I definitely had highlights of my life when I was in the center of them. My teenage years I was addicted to video games. My college years, drinking and smoking. Last year it was my girlfriend and gambling. Now this year I have nothing. I quit smoking (2.5 years), three months off drinking, and have quit gambling. Still have speculative investments but they\u2019re long term holds and I never put more than 10% of my net worth in at a time, and I don\u2019t double down. Either go for bust or wait a year for a profit.\n\nHow do I feel doing this? Replacing all the time of mindless indulgence with exercise and sitting at bar tops with friends stone cold sober?\n\nMiserable. Scared. Bored. Lacking purpose. Desperate for my ex to ring and tell me it\u2019ll be okay. Thirsty for a drink. Considering a cigarette. Anything.\n\nBut, I\u2019m 30. I\u2019m grown. I\u2019ve realized that it\u2019s a blessing when things come into your life that help carry you along and give you comfort and purpose. But that it\u2019s also okay when there\u2019s times in life when you\u2019re caught in the dark. When you\u2019re insecure, when you\u2019re alone, and no one seems to want you around.\n\nBut that\u2019s the time you grow. When you process. You might be In this place because *you deserve it*. You fucked up. Or, other people are at fault. But, you\u2019re grown. Eye for an eye isn\u2019t a viable, healthy option. You have to turn the other cheek and keep moving. Welcome to being an adult.\n\nSo, all I can say to OP is.. just wait. You\u2019ll find something. Especially if you\u2019ve depended on codependency or substance abuse for a long time to keep you occupied, you\u2019re expecting a miracle to *quickly* find meaning. You\u2019re reprogramming your brains rewards centers to seek out long term efforts. It craves excitement and stimulus. But you have to actively fight against that call to action and be comfortable with the grind.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyynau/i_cant_give_meaning_to_my_life_nothing_interests/hey9vm9/"}
