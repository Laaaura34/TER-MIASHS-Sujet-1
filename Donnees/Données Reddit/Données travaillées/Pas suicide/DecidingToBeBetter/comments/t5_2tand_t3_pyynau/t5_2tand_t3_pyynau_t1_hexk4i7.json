But it all started right after my first encounter with depression. I've already gone to therapy plenty times, different therapists I even had one psychiatrist... but it didn't seem to help me. Psychology is a very confusing thing for me, so many different diagnosis I received and it was so confusing, and some therapists had a loooong waiting list and others were so expensive for me to afford more than 1 session, I hated anti depressants made me feel even more tired and the side effects are simply not worth it. I feel hopeless its been 15+ years in a row", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyynau/i_cant_give_meaning_to_my_life_nothing_interests/hexk4i7/"}
