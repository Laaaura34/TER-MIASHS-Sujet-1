I\u2019m on a really bad adderall hell loop and I feel the exact same way. Otherwise it sounds like severe depression, which doesn\u2019t mean anything is wrong with you!! There\u2019s always a way out (I hope - for my sake and yours). But you aren\u2019t a waste of space. I was lamenting to my friend recently while on a walk together that I didn\u2019t have any interests or hobbies and didn\u2019t care about anything. She pointed out later that I got really excited wondering about the history behind a random plot of land that was overgrown. That helped me remind myself that we all have stuff we like, even if it seems very inconsequential, and THAT realization is giving me the hope that I can pull myself out of this and find my true self. So keep searching, and keep living. You\u2019re just around the corner :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyynau/i_cant_give_meaning_to_my_life_nothing_interests/hexhs1y/"}
