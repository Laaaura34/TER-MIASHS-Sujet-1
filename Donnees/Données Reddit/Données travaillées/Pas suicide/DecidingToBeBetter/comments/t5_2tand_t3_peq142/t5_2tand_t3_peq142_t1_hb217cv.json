Naturally I wasn\u2019t fed this \u201climitless possibility\u201d fantasy. The lie would do me no good, but I saw how it affected others. The rich people I met in college more often than not seemed to be completely lost in what to do with their lives. I often saw people major in something completely not suited for their skills. Like if you\u2019re terrible in math and science why are you doing engineering? There was also a delusion that they were naturally good at everything even if they weren\u2019t. Living life in delusion helps no one. The other poor students I went to school with were a lot more honest to themselves about their strengths and weaknesses. Those not in that delusion are much better at accepting constructive criticism from friends without it being a life shattering moment or an end of a friendship.\n\nI dated a guy who was terrible at mixing songs but wanted to work in the music industry mixing songs. I didn\u2019t get how he deluded himself so hard cause everyone knew it was bad, but it was like life shattering if you told him this wasn\u2019t an attainable goal. He had the privilege and educational background (rich parents, MBA) to literally do anything else but wouldn\u2019t hear it. And he didn\u2019t think he needed to take classes or anything. I don\u2019t think people talk enough about how feeding children delusion affects them through adulthood. It should not be life shattering for someone to know and acknowledge a simple truth about themselves.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/peq142/your_possibilities_are_not_limitless_remove_the/hb217cv/"}
