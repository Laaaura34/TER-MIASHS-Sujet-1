It is not enough to imagine things in your head. You will have to do things. \n\nExplore and fail, see what you enjoy learning, doing, pursuing and what you don't. You will only become good at something if you enjoy spending some time doing that \"something\". If you also have some inclination in that direction you will have the chance to become great.\n\nDoing something just because someone else seems to enjoy doing it, is a mistake. Find your own way. Put your experiences, your skills, your likes and dislikes to the test and figure out your areas of interest.\n\nDiscover your limits and then decide which limits to push based on personal skills, inclinations, and preferences, rather than live the illusion in which \"everything is possible\" and \"you can become whatever you want\", all while doing nothing.\n\nAll the best to you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/peq142/your_possibilities_are_not_limitless_remove_the/hb0pspw/"}
