The possibilities are only endless in your imagination. Once you want to transform them into reality, you will encounter limits.\n\n  \nReality is the only place where that matters. No matter how much you would like to push the limits, if you are 1,6 meters in height you will never become the next Michael Jordan or if you hate math and calculus you will never win a Nobel Prize in Physics.  \n\n\nThe point was not to never go beyond what you can currently do. The point was to realistically assess your skills and aspirations, your likes and dislikes, and to define yourself from this perspective instead of being misled by your own thoughts by believing that you can actually become anything.  \n\n\nKnow your limits and then decide which limits to push based on personal skills, inclinations, and preferences, rather than to live the illusion in which \"everything is possible\" and \"you can become whatever you want\".  \n\n\nAll the best to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/peq142/your_possibilities_are_not_limitless_remove_the/hb0p8tw/"}
