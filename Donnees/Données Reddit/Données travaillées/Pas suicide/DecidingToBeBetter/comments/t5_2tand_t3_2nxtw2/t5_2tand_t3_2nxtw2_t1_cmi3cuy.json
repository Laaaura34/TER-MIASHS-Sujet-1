People like you, when you get it right, are very important in this world. \n\nWith that, examples are always good. If you can pair your material with real examples then you would really have something. And by real, I mean, a very detailed analysis of someone that has \"made it\" and how they got there. Not some 2 minute, \"Look at Suzie - she has a great positive smile\". \n\nShows like Shark Tank and The Profit are really good at this but they miss so much with respects to what it really takes...day to day. \n\nWhat I would really like to see is a 30 to 60 minute profile on a business or person that covers what they did, down to every last detail, from start to finish, to get to where they are. Cover all the usual business stuff, but also cover the real emotional day-to-day struggles that tend to slice the average person in half.\n\nSo...that's my idea. Content is what really matters. Without it, your like sugar (an empty calorie).\n\nBut again...GREAT JOB!! I really like what you are doing.  \n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2nxtw2/we_become_what_we_think_about/cmi3cuy/"}
