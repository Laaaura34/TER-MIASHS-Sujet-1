People should vote with their wallets more often and more importantly should be very vocal and very open with each other about what they\u2019re being paid and much more interested in collectively bargaining for wages. Companies post record profits then push the price increases onto the consumer to maintain margins and rent is insane along with housing prices to the point most normal people will never be able to afford a home. Investing in the market only encourages these kinds of practices while CEOs get 100s of millions in bonuses each year but hire union busting firms to avoid paying employees more (Blizzard/activision) if you\u2019re noticing this now you should look more into the entire situation if it\u2019s gotten you curious. It\u2019s great you stopped drinking though!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q37rln/start_voting_with_your_wallet/hfq9oxc/"}
