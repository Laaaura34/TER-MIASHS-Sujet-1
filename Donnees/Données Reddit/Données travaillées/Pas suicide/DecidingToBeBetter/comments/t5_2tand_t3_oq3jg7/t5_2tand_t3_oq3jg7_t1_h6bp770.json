I guess the hardest part for me is practicing compassion towards myself. I\u2019m 30 and really not liking where I am now, my plan has been ruined thanks to the pandemic and now have no idea what to do. My romantic relationship is in the shits, my relationship with my mom is also in the shits. I have no money and buried with debt. I can\u2019t seem to find any motivation to get myself out of it. I find myself comparing myself to other people and just hearing about what they have achieved so far makes me feel so insecure. I feel so much like a disappoint and a failure and it doesn\u2019t help that I don\u2019t get any external motivation or praise from anyone. Right now it feels wrong feeling bad because people close to me has just been telling me to snap out of it or be busy. That\u2019s the thing, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to me but I find it really hard to be productive. I feel like I have lost something. All I want to do now is just escape, I don\u2019t know what to do about it. I know I have to do something but I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how to pull myself out of this or when it will end. I\u2019ve been like this since 2020 and I\u2019m not liking it anymore. Feeling appreciated and praised also feels so awkward. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore, I just feel so down everyday and this \u201csadness\u201d or whatever is just overwhelming and I can\u2019t seem to beat it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oq3jg7/you_cant_overcome_innerconflict_without/h6bp770/"}
