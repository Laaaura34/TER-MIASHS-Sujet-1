I also just finished (and started) reading The Fault In Our Stars today, which was important to me as a purveyor of youth culture and an English major.\n\n- Workout-wise, I'm moving up to running PHAT on upper body and a Smolov cycle on lower for the next three months.\n\n- Nutrition-wise, after the IF and the carb cycling, it'll be nice to not stress as much on a lean bulk for the next 9 months. Still eating healthy but less of a numbers game.\n\n- Relationship-wise, I think I'm finally coming to terms with other people finding me attractive and actually believing it. But I still am not sure if I'm in the right headspace for a relationship right now, so I'm keeping my options open.\n\n- And in other aspects, I'm auditioning for Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on a road audition in a couple weeks, which I tried and failed a few years back. I'm glad I get a second chance. Oh, and a friend of mine needs help with his diet so I'll be assisting with that. :)\n\nI think that pretty much covers it!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/26kcr2/waiting_to_stellify_a_success_story/chtlonv/"}
