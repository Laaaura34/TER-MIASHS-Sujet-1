I always think it's important to keep growing as a person. Growth is one of those big keys to feel like your progressing in life:) (But you know that already!)\n\nExactly :) When we learn to cultivate positivity in happiness we learn to embrace those qualities in life, we naturally thirst for adventure and see life through a child's eyes. Cultivating negativity only allows us to perpetuate our own sadness! :)\n\nI'm Glad you're winning at these things :)\n\nLife can be awesome once you have the proper plan in place I think :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/26kcr2/waiting_to_stellify_a_success_story/chtryld/"}
