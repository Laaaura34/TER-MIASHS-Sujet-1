How about Reddit when you see an account with 10,000 link karma and you scored -4 for some OC?\n\nI'm just growing frustrated with this \"growing body of research\" on how Facebook is leads to low self-esteem.  It's more how certain Facebook usage patterns lead to low self-esteem.  If your browsing through photos of your ex-girlfriend at midnight, your going to have a bad time.\n\nI'm not really sure what I'm getting at, but what you see on your newsfeed is a direct result of your behavior.
