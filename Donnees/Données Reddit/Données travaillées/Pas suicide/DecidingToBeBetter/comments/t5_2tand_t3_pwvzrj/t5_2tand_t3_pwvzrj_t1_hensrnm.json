Make sure the vodka is really terrible. Eat ice cream for breakfast, then jump into the sea if you are near an ocean or a lake and swim. \n\n- Have a really extremely disappointing romantic date with someone who leaves you feeling like your skin is crawling, who also isn't interested in you. \n\n- Buy 20 outfits off AliExpress and wear 1/2 of one outdoors. \n\n- climb or swim something with moderately poor preparation. Nothing that will cause you to die if you fall or dehydrate to death or freeze, but enough to be truly unpleasant e.g. bad sunburn, fire ants.\n\n- pick up a physical activity you have never tried before. Acrobatics. Juggling. Cycling. Handstands. Tightrope. Falling over will make you feel young.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwvzrj/what_can_i_do_to_feel_young_again/hensrnm/"}
