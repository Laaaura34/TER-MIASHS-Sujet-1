At 29 about to hit 30 I was going through an incredibly bad time and had done for much of the previous 2 years to that. Now 35, life is going amazingly well and I look back at 29 and think of myself as still a kid, still young etc. I'm sure in 6 years I'll think of myself today as still young. It's all about reframing where you're at.\n\nAnd as a man, if you're single and near 30? Date someone younger for a bit, like under 25, or if you want a real surprise, try being with a 21-23 year old. It will do two things: first, you will realise how annoying Uni undergrad and postgrad students actually are and how much people mature in the years after. Secondly, you'll realise that you're really not as old as you think, even into your 30s you can easily keep up with younger people, but my goodness why would you want to?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwvzrj/what_can_i_do_to_feel_young_again/henhea2/"}
