I was about to commiserate with you and caught myself laughing instead. I do remember (I am way older than you) having a sense that my choices were narrowing at your age but my idea of feeling old, is worn out, body parts sagging, stiff joints and trouble getting up from a chair that is too low.\n\nImmediately learn to laugh at yourself finding ways to build a humorous  healthy way of looking at how ridiculous feeling OLD at less than 30 is. Whoever is telling you to move on is not giving you much help. Sounds like you need to work really hard to address the depression and anxiety, what you have done so far has not worked. Seek out some online groups unrelated to facebook and find a fresh new approach for finding methods to counterbalance your triggers. Deep dive into subjects like happiness training or creation. Get to work. Your not old but your not happy. Don't get into anything like marriage or change much until you get some progress.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwvzrj/what_can_i_do_to_feel_young_again/heouisj/"}
