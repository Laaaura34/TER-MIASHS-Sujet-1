For example, replying here is my \u201c1 thing\u201d today.\n\nSee a weird snack you never tried?  Eat it!  Band you never heard of?  Play their latest album!  Ask a coworker to hangout, or join a group/class!  Maybe even skydive if that\u2019s what you\u2019re feeling!  Sure, you might not like some of it, but you\u2019ll find some awesome things too and that\u2019s the point.  Maybe you\u2019ll find a new hobby and make more friends in the process!  It just takes time.\n\nOne thing that I always say is to trust your gut.  If you\u2019re stepping out of your comfort zone but things just don\u2019t feel right or safe, then stop it and leave.  Your safety is the most important.  You have a whole life to live and more cool things to discover the next day anyways!\n\nHope that helps.  You\u2019re welcome to message me if you want to bounce off ideas!  Good luck on your journey!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwvzrj/what_can_i_do_to_feel_young_again/hekp4jx/"}
