From the sounds of it, it isnt that you miss being young but that you kiss the feeling of carefreeness and happiness, well luckily these are not external though they seem to be reactions to external things. If you focus of the things you do control, your thoughts\n\n\"your soul takes on the colour of your mind\"\n\n \"The happiness of our life depends upon the aulity of our thoughts\" \n\nI would urge you not to turn to things to make you feel better because you will become dependent upon them and once that rush has gone youll be back to square one looking for the next thing to \"make\" you happy. \n\nIm not saying to live a bland grey life devoid of anything which makes you happy, but try not to rely upon anything for happiness.\n\nTry: \n\nA monks guide to happiness\n\nThe little book of stoicism\n\nBoth of these helped me alot when i was servely depressed. \n\nYou are going through a trial\n\n\"A gem cannot be polished without friction nor a man perfected without trails!\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwvzrj/what_can_i_do_to_feel_young_again/hela8pl/"}
