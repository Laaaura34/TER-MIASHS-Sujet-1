I am 22 and I\u2019m probably in no place to give advice but I will tell you what I do with my life just to give you some ideas. I love watching my little pony. I also love peppa pig and my friends and family know me as a huge shrek fan. I also love to knit and paint. I have been learning a few languages too! I am also into health and wellness. yoga, pilates, etc. all right up my alley. I love to cook as well! love me some anime too. \n\npinterest is a great way to get into hobbies or find things you might like!!! there is a board for literally everything! get the app and create a board for everything you want or save some boards! :D you can still \u201cfeel young\u201d because you still are young!!! you can still make up for lost time. I say just create a list of things you have seen other people do that you have always wanted to try out. or things you want to learn or try out. \n\nbeing in my 20s for me has just been dating myself. I do everything alone and I have many hobbies that keep me busy when I\u2019m not in uni. date yourself. go to a museum. explore cute cafes in your city. try out cuisine from every country! you could make a list of countries and put a check mark when you try its cuisine! take a pottery class. watch Anne with an E. watch gilmore girls. experiment with makeup if you are into it! glossy eyes, bright eyeshadow, etc. change your hair. dye it if you\u2019d like! cut it, etc! :D\n\ndon\u2019t judge yourself either! whether that is going to the movies alone or watching a kids cartoon!!! I hope I have helped in some way :) < 333", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwvzrj/what_can_i_do_to_feel_young_again/hejnhm6/"}
