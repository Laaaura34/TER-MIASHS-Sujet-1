This is the best part about life. You get to make it whatever you want. I lost my youth to toxic relationships and fundamentalist religion. I\u2019m now 40 and you better bet your ass I\u2019m having the best time right now! I am teaching myself how to dance to all the songs I wasn\u2019t allowed to listen to. I\u2019m unapologetically queer and living my best queer life. I decided I wanted to learn how to make really good tea and pasta, so I did. I want to learn how to ride a skateboard, so I bought one for me and my kid. I do silly things like attend art festivals and get my cards and palms read. I make bad art. Really bad art. I\u2019m learning home repairs. I found out I really love hiking despite having allergies lol! I worked through a lot of trauma. I ended relationships with people who no longer supported the whole weird crazy version of me. \n\nMy point is, that yeah, you know what, youth is sometimes wasted on the young, but you have so much more time to do whatever you want. Please don\u2019t buy into \u201cI\u2019m this old so I need to be doing this with my life\u201d line of thinking. It\u2019s not worth it. You just find out what kind of amazing person you are, or you want to be, and go be that person. Be unapologetically you. Because you\u2019re beautiful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwvzrj/what_can_i_do_to_feel_young_again/helk6cy/"}
