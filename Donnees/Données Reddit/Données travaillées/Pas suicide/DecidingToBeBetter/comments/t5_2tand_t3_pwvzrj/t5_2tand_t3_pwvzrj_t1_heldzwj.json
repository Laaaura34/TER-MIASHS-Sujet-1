Don't judge where you are at based off everyone else. Honestly know so many people who rushed into things in their 20s due to social pressure who are now miserable. \n\nOne good quote I heard was that your 20s are for figuring how what you don't want to do and your 30s are for going after what you do want to do. That's a great way of looking at things. I wasn't ready for life goals when I was 20, I was lost and like you anxious and depressed, but those life experiences led to me where I am now. Goal orientated and chasing dreams that I never before thought I could achieve.\n\nHonestly if your 30 and single there's nothing you can't do. The world is your oyster. There's no rule book that says you just be married with kids and in the job you'll be in until you retire. \n\nFigure out what you want and then research the steps you need to get there. Literally anything can be learned if you want including social skills, relationships, confidence, willpower etc. It's all a process, often times the late bloomers end up being the most successful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwvzrj/what_can_i_do_to_feel_young_again/heldzwj/"}
