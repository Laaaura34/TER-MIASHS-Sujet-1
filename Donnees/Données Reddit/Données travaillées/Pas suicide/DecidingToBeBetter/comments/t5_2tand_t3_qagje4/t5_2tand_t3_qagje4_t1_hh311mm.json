You deserve to be happy, but not at the expense of someone else's wants.\n\nYou say you have a fear of being taken advantage of.  Well, your guy friend coming back to you time and time again with no thought of future commitment is taking advantage of your vulnerabilities.  I hope you will do the right thing and spend some time working on yourself and doing things for yourself that make you feel fulfilled and happy.\n\nWhen things are right for you, someone will come into your life, and things will be so much better for you because you will be confident, happy, self-secure, self-loved, and living life with purpose.\n\nGood luck to you, friend.  You can do this.  :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qagje4/heart_broken_and_moving_on_day_by_day/hh311mm/"}
