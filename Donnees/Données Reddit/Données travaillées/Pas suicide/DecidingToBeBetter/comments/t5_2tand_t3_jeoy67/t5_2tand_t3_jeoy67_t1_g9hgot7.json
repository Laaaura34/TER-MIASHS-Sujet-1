It pertains to how I\u2019m feeling about things. I\u2019d love nothing more than.. but I won\u2019t because I deserve to suffer. My life is going to be spent alone, because I don\u2019t want to subject anybody to me. I don\u2019t need a response, I know the insanity of the though process. The last 30 years of my life have been a circling mess of me being hurt. Then me hurting others out of lack of control out of my own stupid trauma. I\u2019m working on it, but I\u2019ll never let anyone close.
