I am just a stranger on the internet, but my two cents:\n\nI used to feel this way all the time. It was the standard way I felt everyday, even on good days.  Life just didn't feel worth all the damn work I had to do. In my case, I was actually depressed. Sometimes, the longer that you go on feeling like that, the more it just seems like the norm/standard, something to be dealt with indefinitely. I managed to address my particular depression with CBT therapy and eventually SSRIs and I no longer feel this way. I now feel like life is worth it and I feel strong enough to handle life's challenges. \n\nGood luck! <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pliujp/what_should_i_do_when_i_want_to_just_give_up/hcb4b9e/"}
