Set a reminder on your phone for x:00 and just take a minute to think about what your are grateful for. \n\nAlso, start looking at smaller time intervals for greatness - how do I make this week the best and most fun, or the day, or the hour? How do I get the most out of this short period of time?\n\nSpiritually, what are you taking in on a day to day basis that you could do without? What media can you cut out that is not attributing to your happiness.  If our phones, computers and televisions are the windows to our worlds in this tech world - what do we want to fill it with? \n\nLastly, meditation is a great practice because it allows you to have a better experience with your thoughts.  You get better at picking and choosing what you attach yourself to - if your thoughts were a train going through a station, you can work to stay on the platform until you want to get in the car that is going by instead of getting into every single car.  \n\nLove yourself, love your growth, love your strength, love you accomplishments and see that every new beginning is some other beginnings end.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pliujp/what_should_i_do_when_i_want_to_just_give_up/hcbzeca/"}
