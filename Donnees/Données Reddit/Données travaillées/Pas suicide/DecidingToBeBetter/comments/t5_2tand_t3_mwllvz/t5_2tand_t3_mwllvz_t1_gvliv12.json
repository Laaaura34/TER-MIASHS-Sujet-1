Totally valid question, I wondered that myself before going to my first appointment. From my experience, that first meeting is usually pretty straightforward. Part of it will be administrative (forms, insurance info, etc), and then they'll probably introduce themselves and give you a bit of info on what their focus is (ACT, CBT, DBT, or another therapy framework). Don't worry if you're not clear on what that all means at first. Ask questions and see if it feels like a good fit. This is someone you will be opening up to, so if you're not comfortable with them or their process, it won't be as effective. \n\nThey'll probably ask you to tell them more about yourself or why you're there today. It is totally up to you whether that answer is your life story or a simple, \"I need help with _______.\" They'll take notes and probably nod along, asking questions to see what topics/techniques would be most helpful and relevant. The appointment could end with them scheduling the next session. Or if you've accidentally reached out to someone that specializes in X but you need support in Y, they could refer you to someone they know is a better match. They might also tell you about group therapy options available. Sometimes those are cheaper and can help you form a sense of community\u2014a win-win.\n\nYou might want to think about what to do after that first meeting that's restorative. For me, that very first appointment was the first time I felt seen, and sharing my backstory was emotionally exhausting. I was thankful it was an evening appointment and I didn't have anywhere to be afterwards. Take some time to unwind, reflect on the session, and reset. Wishing you luck and healing \ud83d\udc95", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mwllvz/ive_been_in_therapy_for_two_months_now_and_my/gvliv12/"}
