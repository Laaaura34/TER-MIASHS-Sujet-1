It was cool...but not aligned with who I am. \n\nSo I switched therapists. A good therapist will *tell* you that if you don\u2019t jive with them, then to try another person. Obviously give it a couple of sessions because session zero is really just basic information. \n\nBut you need someone you trust, who understand how you see the world, and has the right type of tools for who you are. \n\nMy partner right now has a therapist who is \u201cfine.\u201d He won\u2019t listen to me when I say to try someone new because \u201cwhat will be different?\u201d\nSo. Much. Will. Be. Different.  \n\nHow the therapist talks to you, how their guidance resonates with you...that matters. \n\nYou\u2019ve got this. You can do this.
