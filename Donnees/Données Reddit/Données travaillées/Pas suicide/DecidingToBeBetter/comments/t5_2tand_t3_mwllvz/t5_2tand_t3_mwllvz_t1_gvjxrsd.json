I hope you maintain your new perspective. \n\nI had a very similar experience that started off how you\u2019re describing your feelings. \n\nWhen I started seeing a Clinical Psychiatrist, I began feeling much better very quickly. The change was dramatic. I couldn\u2019t believe it and wanted to share it with the world. I went from suicidal to wanting to save the world in a matter of 4/5 weeks. I wanted to blog about mental health, setup a charity, quit my career etc.\n\nAfter 10-days or so of feeling genuinely on top the world, I was diagnosed with Mania, caused by the 200mg sertraline that had been prescribed. I was then put on anti-psychotic meds to bring me down. It\u2019s since taken me 2 years to neurologically recover from that episode.\n\nI truly hope how you\u2019re feeling is genuine and not fully drug induced!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mwllvz/ive_been_in_therapy_for_two_months_now_and_my/gvjxrsd/"}
