When I fall in to bad habits, it amplifies my depression/anxiety and makes me feel like shit. I'm constantly sad or scared and I can't enjoy anything anymore because I feel gross.

The only thing that snaps me out of it is thinking about when I have felt good and been kind to my loved ones.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hfqs3j/serious_question_what_makes_you_want_to_get_better/fvzkj9y/"}
