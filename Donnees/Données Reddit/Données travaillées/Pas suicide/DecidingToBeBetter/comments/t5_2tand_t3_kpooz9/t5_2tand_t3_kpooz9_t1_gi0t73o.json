Idk what to say, it was a bunch of stuff from different sources that made me change my mindset and perspective on things: meditation, being more conscious of my thoughts, accepting my emotions and my \"shadow\", understanding basic psychology, philosophies such as Stoicism, books (I found the Mark Manson's ones really helpful),etc. It took time and often the repetition of certain ideas for my mind to finally \"swallow\" them. Im no Buddha though, I don't feel like growth is linear, today im good but two weeks ago I was completely missing clarity and falling into bad habits. I have my ups and my downs and im still going to have them, but embracing those downs and the \"uncomfortable feelings\" they come with them was useful, is a tough thing that im still learning. I hope it helps, I kinda brainstormed the first things that came to my mind so im sorry if maybe this isn't clear enough, wish you the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kpooz9/f17_i_was_able_to_respond_to_a_negative_behavior/gi0t73o/"}
