Everything you practiced during that stress charged exchange was so inline with the book\u2019s advice on how to deal with an emotionally out of control person, specifically parents.

It\u2019s takes time to see things for how they really are but once it clicks you will always be able to manage your emotions independent from the responses of everyone around you. It\u2019s so freeing to not feel at the mercy of other people\u2019s expectations and often emotional manipulations.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kpooz9/f17_i_was_able_to_respond_to_a_negative_behavior/ghzso8f/"}
