As someone who's struggled (and sometimes still is) with their mother, I have to say Im so proud of you!! \n\n\nIt cant be easy having to deal with that. Especially in your own home. The fact that youre able to acknowledge that her outburst is more about her than about you is a huge accomplishment, and one that will serve you well moving forward. Not just with your mom, but with so many other aspects of life. :)\n\n\nThere may be times your mom notices she isnt getting to you and changes tactics, either by guiltripping or gaslighting or something else. Something to try to make you feel bad for not giving her the reaction she wants. It can be hard at first, making you feel guilty and shameful, like your doing something wrong or being cruel.  \n\n\nSomething that helped for me was acknowledging and allowing myself to feel these feelings, but reminding myself that it doesnt change whats happening or happened, or who she is as a person. You can feel guilty, but dont let it interfere with your reasoning abilities. (Which are very well developed for your age!)\n\n\nAgain, Im so happy you found the wisdom and strength to do that. You go girl!!\ud83d\udc96", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kpooz9/f17_i_was_able_to_respond_to_a_negative_behavior/gi012sv/"}
