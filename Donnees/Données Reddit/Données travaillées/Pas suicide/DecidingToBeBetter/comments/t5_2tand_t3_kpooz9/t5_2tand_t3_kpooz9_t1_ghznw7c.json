You deserve to be proud of yourself, too. Hopefully making this post helped you process and solidify this emotional level-up; and in the future, you\u2019ll have this to re-read. How wonderful that you\u2019ve written it out so eloquently while it\u2019s still fresh on your mind!\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve had to re-learn my most important lessons in different circumstances: I\u2019ll feel like I have something on lock and then a new situation arises that makes me feel like I\u2019m back at square one. That\u2019s an illusion, though, because growth is a process wherein we build on our previous work. Writing out my experiences like you\u2019ve done here or even writing letters to myself has been monumental for reminding me that I am strong and I have changed.\n\nYou\u2019re persevering through important inner work with impressive resilience. I am so proud of you. Use this moment as a reference point going forward \u2014 this is *proof* that you are **strong**, you are **wise**, and you are **loving**. You\u2019ve already set yourself up for success by jackhammering the foundation you had and picking through the pieces to put yourself back together. That\u2019s hard work, but **you did it**. The impact of your inner work will be more significant you can imagine. You\u2019re a leader and it bears repeating: I am so, so proud of you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kpooz9/f17_i_was_able_to_respond_to_a_negative_behavior/ghznw7c/"}
