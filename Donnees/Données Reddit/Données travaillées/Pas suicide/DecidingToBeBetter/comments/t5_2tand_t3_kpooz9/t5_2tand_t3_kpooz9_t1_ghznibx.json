Something along the lines of \u201c I can see you\u2019re upset and I\u2019m sorry for any part I had in that, I apologise if this is a hard topic for you to discuss\u201d. \n\nAnother tactic that can be used I call \u201cnaming the behaviour\u201d. Basically if you\u2019re talking in a calm manor and someone responds aggressively you can say \u201cI can see you\u2019re upset about this but I\u2019m a little confused about why you reacted so strongly and I\u2019d like to understand so I can avoid doing the same in the future,  as it wasn\u2019t my intention to cause any pain\u201d\n\nWhat this does is make them aware that their reaction was bigger than what the conversation warranted while also showing that you care. \n\nRemember just because you understand her emotions does not mean you need to put up with people being awful to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kpooz9/f17_i_was_able_to_respond_to_a_negative_behavior/ghznibx/"}
