I was an absolute mess and made a fool of myself. I quit drinking as much but it wasnt until Christmas time that I finally gave it up. My wife keeps assuring me I can have a drink here and there but I don't want to lose my progress. As you've said, we've come this far and I know it's a slippery slope. \n\nCongratulations on getting out of the abusive relationship and sobering up! Those are both awesome achievements and you should be pretty damn proud yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0n6gr/a_year_ago_i_was_an_awful_person/h20tepd/"}
