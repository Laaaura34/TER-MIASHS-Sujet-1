We rush through them with distractions like music or podcasts to get to the real and important parts of life but the majority of our lives are these transitional states. \n\n\nIt's important to make time to learn to approach these times with mindful awareness, to allow ourselves to be present and focus on seeing all the weird and beautiful things we forgot are there because we've been taught to feel ashamed and guilty of dedicating our time and focus to things that aren't \"important\" and will only lure us away from the fame and glory we need to be happy. \n\n\nPlease, next time you have to wash dishes set aside 10 min and find funny joyful interesting weird things through the activity. Make fun bubbles, enjoy the squeaky squeak music you can make with squeaky clean glass, focus on how the texture of the soap changes as it absorbs oils and any or all of the stuff I missed. Allow yourself to enjoy yourself because you deserve to and anyone telling you that you don't deserve to enjoy life is wrong in that regard", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0mpva/im_so_sick_of_being_depressed_and_watching_others/hfcnxps/"}
