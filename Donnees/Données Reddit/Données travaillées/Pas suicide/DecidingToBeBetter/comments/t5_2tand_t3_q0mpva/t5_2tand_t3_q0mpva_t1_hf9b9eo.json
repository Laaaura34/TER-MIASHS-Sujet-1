My wife still spends a lot of time scrolling through social media, but these days at least she doesn't \"buy into\" the false images. \n\nI believe that 90% of social media is just fake persona's. It's much healthier to focus on yourself (your real Self) and stick to wholesome communications. \n\nPersonally I try to keep about 3 real/true friends at any given time. Three Real friends are better than 3,000 Instagram followers any day...", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0mpva/im_so_sick_of_being_depressed_and_watching_others/hf9b9eo/"}
