Based off of what you wrote, you\u2019re thinking is fairly negative. I think your first step should be therapy. You would be surprised to see how many treatment options are out there for therapy. There is not just talk therapy. There is behavioral therapy that is supposed to help you change your thought pattern. I\u2019d also recommend some yoga, meditation, and writing down things you are grateful for. It could be little things like the train getting to the station on time, having a class cancelled, your friends, etc. Something that helped me be more positive is the secret. It\u2019s on Netflix. Hope this helps. I know it\u2019s hard to change but you owe it to yourself and to your loved ones who need you there.
