I am currently in therapy, but it\u2019s to treat a specific issue separate from this. I think, however, I\u2019ll be able to share about my abuse to a therapist soon, I wasn\u2019t ready before, with this one or another therapist. I\u2019m ready to start healing and accepting my past! :D\n\nI\u2019m in my early 20s, i already chose a career, but I want to switch and turn my hobby into a career so hearing you say I should go for it really helps. Thank you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/padh6n/how_to_get_over_all_of_the_experiences_i_missed/ha79i6w/"}
