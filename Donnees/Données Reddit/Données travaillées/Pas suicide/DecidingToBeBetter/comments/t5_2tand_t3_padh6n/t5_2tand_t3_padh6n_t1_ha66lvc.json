I'll tell you by my experience that people say it's hard to find the right therapist. It's not. Find the first one you see, don't go for too cheap and also not too expensive for you. If it doesn't work then try a different one. Don't believe that you on your own can heal and integrate all trauma, it's very inefficient and time consuming.\n\nHere's a secret, everyone needs therapy. You got the worst end of the stick, but we all share some trauma or another. We all have unhealed wounds. \n\nHow old are you? If you're under 35 then as long as you go to therapy and work on your career you will find yourself at a better place each year. \n\nHere's an unpopular opinion, don't get hung up on which career to choose or whether you chose the right thing or not. Here's the thing, as long as you can do it physically and you have the intellectual capacity for it, then there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't do it. Don't let your emotions get in the way and get yourself in therapy if you can't get over yourself.\n\n All the love! Good luck!!! I believe in you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/padh6n/how_to_get_over_all_of_the_experiences_i_missed/ha66lvc/"}
