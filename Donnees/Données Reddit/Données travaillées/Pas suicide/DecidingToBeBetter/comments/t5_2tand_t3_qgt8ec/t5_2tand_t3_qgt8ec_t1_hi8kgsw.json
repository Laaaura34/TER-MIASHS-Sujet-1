Thank you for sharing so openly with us.\n\nI understand that things may be tough at the moment. Customer service is a difficult job, especially with everything happening in the world. Thinking about the future seems like a dead-end because things aren't clear with your job and your girlfriend. But before you make a decision that could end up hurting you and her, I would invite you to take a couple of days off to reflect on what you want to do next in your life. You are 24. You're still at the beginning of your life. You have so many opportunities and chances to grow ahead of you, but no one is going to help you grow if you don't make the decision yourself. Look at your life and see what you are missing. Maybe you need to invest in a hobby or in sports. Something to break up the routine of your regular workday. Maybe pursue a higher degree or take a class. \n\nAlso, sometimes we fail at recognizing our achievements. This is because our culture pushes us to constantly be achieving new things and making more and more money. But what you have achieved for yourself is admirable. Take time to re-assess where you want to be and where you want to head in life, but also make sure to appreciate what you have and what you are willing to let go of.\n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgt8ec/im_24_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_myself/hi8kgsw/"}
