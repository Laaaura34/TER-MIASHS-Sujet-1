The trick is setting a standard for those tasks and doing no less, then going on auto pilot. The motivation comes from the benefits I enjoy after said task was done, such as the peace an organized and clean home brings me or how good I feel when I take my shirt off at the beach. If you\u2019re not feeling it somedays, take your time off, but learn the difference between a break and quitting. Little goals amount to big wins enhancing motivation all around.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mzjsq1/who_has_unwavering_willpower/gw1b6zo/"}
