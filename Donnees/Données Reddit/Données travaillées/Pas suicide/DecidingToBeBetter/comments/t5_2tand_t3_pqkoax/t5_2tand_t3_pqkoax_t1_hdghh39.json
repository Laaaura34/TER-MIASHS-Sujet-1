I exercise a few times a few, always walking my dogs and try to eat pretty healthy. I was on it about a decade ago when I wasn't watching everything and I put on way more weight and was the reason I initially stopped taking it (dumb idea, I know lol). I only take it at night, but if I can make it more than 20 minutes, oh boy do I wanna eat. It probably doesn't help that I'm usually high at night too lol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqkoax/i_havent_drunk_alcohol_for_almost_a_month_yet_i/hdghh39/"}
