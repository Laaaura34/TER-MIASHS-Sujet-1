Once I realized that was no longer an option, I had no choice but to get help. I didn't really have the ability to go to rehab at the time, because I would have lost my job and I didn't have much money. So what I did was start going to AA, went to a medical doctor to deal with some issues I had, got a psychologist, got a gym membership and a bike and went to war. \n\nMy hobby was music. I have fronted a jam band I started about 15 years ago. We played at clubs, bars and festivals, and I can't do those things anymore. I know there are people that can but so far I'm not one of them. Frankly the thought of being on stage in front of people is terrifying now. I never got on stage anywhere close to sober. For that matter I never practiced sober. I realize that a lot of my drinking and using was self-medicating now. Music just doesn't hit like it did before and I can't really get into it like I did. For now that just doesn't feel like an option.\n\nI have dabbled in art over the years but I really got into it over the pandemic. I did a bunch of digital art over that time and even sold some stuff so that was cool, but that's a solitary thing as far as I know it, so it didn't really help in that regard.\n\nThank you for your kind words, they mean a lot.\n\nEdit: spelling and grammer.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqkoax/i_havent_drunk_alcohol_for_almost_a_month_yet_i/hdcle0i/"}
