Nothing done at night should ruin the following day(s). I\u2019m glad you found something that makes you feel better and have the will power not to give into social pressure. \n\nSometimes social pressure can be intense and I\u2019ve found that appearing to drink while your not helps. My coworker is a recovering alcoholic, and when go out at conferences, he orders a soda water and with two limes and asks that it is in a glass that G&Ts are served. Everyone that works with him directly knows what is going on, but he doesn\u2019t have explain why he isn\u2019t drinking to strangers. I do the same thing after drinking my first drink out. It allows me to moderate my drinking and I don\u2019t have to explain why I\u2019m not drinking. I know you should never feel pressured to drink, but sometimes it\u2019s easier to appear to be drinking alcohol when you are not.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqkoax/i_havent_drunk_alcohol_for_almost_a_month_yet_i/hdbrsaz/"}
