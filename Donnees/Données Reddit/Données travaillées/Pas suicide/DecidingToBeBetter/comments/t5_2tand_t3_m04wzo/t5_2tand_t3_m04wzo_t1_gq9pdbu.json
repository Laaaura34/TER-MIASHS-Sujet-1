It got so bad that I left the country to start fresh wouldn\u2019t let people in close so that I didn\u2019t hurt them. I was a really angry person, but also very sad and constantly fatigued. The more I would have outbursts, the more I was convinced I was a bad person. It became unmanageable by the end of 2019 and I sought help. It turns out I have major depressive disorder, and have a lot to work out from my childhood. I did some CBT, group therapy and am on anti-depressants.\n\nI still have days where I don\u2019t feel so good, but I don\u2019t feel so irrational or erratic with my emotions; as in, I don\u2019t feel short-tempered or as sensitive as I once did.\n\nAll that isn\u2019t to say you are depressed, but you might have some stuff to work through. It\u2019s good that you have the self-awareness, that\u2019s a step in itself. It\u2019s worth looking in to and could impact your life in such a positive way. I felt constantly drained previously, and now I can focus that energy on other things that make life better.\n\nI wish you the best! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m04wzo/im_sensitive_and_i_have_a_temper/gq9pdbu/"}
