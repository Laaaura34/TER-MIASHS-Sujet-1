That makes me really happy for you. Attending therapy regularly has been really hard for me. As time goes on, you may find you have other mental illnesses as well. I have adhd and bipolar and ptsd as well. I find it hard to control myself with alcohol/ other substances so I tend to stay away from most of them all together. I really wish you the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obtsb5/i_am_done_getting_drunk_at_bars_for_the_sake_of/h3yx06a/"}
