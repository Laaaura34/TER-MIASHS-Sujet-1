I am a girl and I also went to bars for hook ups and so did my friends so it's not a horrible thing. It's just part of finding yourself. Being with different people. Realising what works for you. It's great you found that that is not what you want but dude... Just wanting to hook up in night clubs does not make you a bad person. There is a lot of people of all genders wanting that too. I am 30 now and married so I don't do that anymore but I had a phase too. And so did my husband. Until way later than 18 so just be true to yourself and live your life dude. You are not a bad person. Say sorry to your friend and move on. Everyone does dumb shit drunk.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obtsb5/i_am_done_getting_drunk_at_bars_for_the_sake_of/h3tmkoj/"}
