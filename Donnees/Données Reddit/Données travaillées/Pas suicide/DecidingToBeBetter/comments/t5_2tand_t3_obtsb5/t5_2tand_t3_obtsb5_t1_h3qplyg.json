What I learned is that I over drink when it happens and don\u2019t eat or stay hydrated. I lost a lot of friends due to this  borderline personality disorder and being too drunk). I\u2019m more in control of it now that I can recognize when it starts to happen. Just limit your self when your out drinking eat a lot and always drink water in between each shot. I really started to chug a glass of water after each drink And it does work. Also the anger comes from deep down issues you have with your self. Don\u2019t stop chasing chicks just don\u2019t get wasted in public. No one likes to hang out with me either and I know that\u2019s the main reason why. Don\u2019t let this be the reason people hate to hang with you. I can honestly say I hate being alone and I miss my friends but What is done is done and there\u2019s no going back. It\u2019s not partying that\u2019s the issue it\u2019s your drinking habits. For me it\u2019s harder to control my personality disorder when I\u2019m intoxicated and I can change my emotions faster than the DJ MIXING MUSIC . Just learn how to recognize the pattern and shut it off be for you get out of hand. After reading your post I\u2019m embarrassed of all the times I didn\u2019t have control. I apologize countless amount of times to people and regret a lot of bad things I\u2019ve done. Yes I had some good times as well but the bad times stick around much longer. Take care and I hope me sharing this with you help as much as you sharing help me.
