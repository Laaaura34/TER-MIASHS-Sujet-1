I\u2019m trying to get into journaling myself. You can find recommendations of good habits by googling, but the best way I found to be inspired to try something new is if someone inspires you! Find something that sounds cool and check websites, pinterest/instagram, youtube and/or podcasts, and just try :) Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c38vi3/im_devoting_three_months_to_self_improvement_what/erpek5d/"}
