Once you wake up do 10-20 push ups and sit ups, followed by a one minute plank. Drink two full glasses of water, (or carry a water bottle with you all day that you can refill). Finally, do at least one productive task for half an hour (at the least). \n\nIf you do this every day, you\u2019ll get a little something done every day, you\u2019ll stay in moderate shape, you\u2019ll stay hydrated, and you\u2019ll grow into a working sleep schedule. All of this combined really helps for a clearer mind, plus you may have gotten a lot of home projects done too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c38vi3/im_devoting_three_months_to_self_improvement_what/erqaox4/"}
