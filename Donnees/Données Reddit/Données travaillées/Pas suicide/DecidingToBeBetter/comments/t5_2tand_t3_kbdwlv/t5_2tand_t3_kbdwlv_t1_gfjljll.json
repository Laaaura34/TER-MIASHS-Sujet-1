Do not let guys determine your self-worth. Women and girls are held to impossible beauty standards, while boys and men who are downright ugly think they are entitled to an attractive women. You need to focus on being healthy, not \u201cpretty.\u201d And screw that guy or any guy who \u201cimplies\u201d that you are ugly. One of my former male friends once complained about having so-called \u201cfat chicks\u201d hit on him at parties. I tapped his pot belly and said I really hate it when guys with pot bellies hit on fit women at parties.
