At least it's nothing that humans have eaten since we've been on this planet. \n\nThe human body is not designed to eat the shit people are eating today. Sure, it can eat it, just like you CAN bake yourself in the sun without sunscreen for years and years. Heck, you'll have a great tan until you're 50 and have skin cancer and a ton of wrinkles. \n\nand congrats on avoiding subway. A 12 inch sub has a TON of carbs. \n\nA 12 inch sub has over 90 grams of carbs (from the bread). That's like drinking 3 cokes! (all carbs get turned into glucose, so they are all the same unless they are loaded with fibre, which neither a coke or subway bread are). \n\nSubway pushes the notion that \"fat\" is bad... but i don't think its nearly as bad as eating too many carbs. Subway is just as \"gluttonous\" as Mcdonalds or taco bell. Sure, it has a TINY bit of vegetables and meat, but most of what you are eating is the bread.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2mmmx2/my_experience_cutting_out_soft_drinks_and_fast/cm5sbrx/"}
