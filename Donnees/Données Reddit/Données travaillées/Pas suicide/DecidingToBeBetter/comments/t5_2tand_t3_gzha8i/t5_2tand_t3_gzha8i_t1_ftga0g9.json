Losing friends BREAKS me. It tears me in ways I didn\u2019t even know I could be torn. I tend to struggle with expressing my love to friends myself. But like you said, the intensity is always there. They become a part of me, especially the close ones. And I\u2019d do any and everything for them and physically hurt when I feel hopeless. I used to think it was a bad thing, to feel this deeply. Especially knowing what you said, about people always leaving anyway. But I guess even through all the heartache, and wishing I never had to experience that pain (as I currently am now AGAIN) I realized that those emotions make us special, and in this world there ain\u2019t ever nothing really wrong with being special, we just see the depth of things through our own eyes. It connects us more to how life truly is I guess. I too am on the journey of self improvement, because I definitely feel like this becomes attachment and unhealthy at many points. So although I can\u2019t offer advice, I\u2019m here to say that you aren\u2019t alone, and if ya ever need someone to relate to about it. You can pm me :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gzha8i/attachment_issues_and_fear_of_loss/ftga0g9/"}
