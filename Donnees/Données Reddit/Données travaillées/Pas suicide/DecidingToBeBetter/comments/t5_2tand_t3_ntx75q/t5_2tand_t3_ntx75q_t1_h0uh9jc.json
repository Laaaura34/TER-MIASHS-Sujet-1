I drank and drugged my 20\u2019s away, working in finance where I was so miserable. I felt like I had zero purpose and couldn\u2019t of felt more lost in life by age 28. I knew my days were numbered in banking because I was a mess mentally/ physically from severe depression and partying. I got laid off which in hindsight was a blessing. I took a few weeks for myself to truly soul search and brainstorm what would make me happy. I pursued and teaching, coaching, and fitness career which I absolutely love. Find hobbies, activities, even a career where you will be glad to wake up every morning to go do. Start making small gratitude lists every morning they help me a lot, 5-10 things you\u2019re grateful for. You have your health, life, shelter, food, clothing, and a good paying job! It took me until 30+ age wise to understand that life is incredible and all the other things women, own place, etc\u2026 that will all fall into place very soon. Become the best version of you first.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ntx75q/i_feel_like_ive_missed_out_on_my_youth_and_i_dont/h0uh9jc/"}
