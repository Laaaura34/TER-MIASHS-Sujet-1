The pool guy was an entertainer, Clara was an artist/singer and the bad guy was a story teller.\n\nI've been told that I'm magnetic. People stop talking and listen when I speak, laugh at my jokes and come to me for advice. I'm always been described like you have described your magnets. (Topic for a different post: how can I use that ability to succeed in my life and overcome fear though) \n\nI'm also a writer and a film maker.
