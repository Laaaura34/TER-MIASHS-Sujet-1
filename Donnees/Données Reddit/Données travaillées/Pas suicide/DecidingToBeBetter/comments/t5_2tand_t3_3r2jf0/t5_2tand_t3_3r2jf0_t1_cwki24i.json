It's interesting-- a bunch of people getting thrown together from different countries and backgrounds into a sort of social experiment where no one has a role. You're free to be yourself and interact with all these new people, a lot of them people that you feel like you've known forever after a few short days. \n\nAnyways, I've noticed that magnetism about people too and I am always finding new ways to understand that mindset in my life.  If your energy is needy and insecure you may try to act out to get attention. If your energy is cool calm and collected then you will be receptive to others and seek to understand first before you speak. If you can do this with a positive attitude then you're in the zone. \n\nI think you have to be in a constant state of improvement to achieve this mindset, because if you don't love yourself for something then you have nothing to fall back on and you will be very impressionable. I don't think it's a good idea to look for quick fixes or anything but I did get the chance to try MDMA recently and it helped me break down some walls inside my head. I noticed emotions as they were coming up and actively dealt with them. I never realized how much jealousy was in my life and how much it's holding me back. There's a lot of love in this world, it's as simple as removing the negative and useless out of your life to let the good stuff in.
