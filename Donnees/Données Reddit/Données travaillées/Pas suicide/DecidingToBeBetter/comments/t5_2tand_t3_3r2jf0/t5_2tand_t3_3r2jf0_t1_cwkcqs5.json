Guy and Clara are positive- they're not SEEKING anything from you, they are being who they are, in an honest way, and everyone can agree that's awesome. John sounds negative- he's only doing things to manipulate. And although he may be magnetic, you've never met the \"real\" john. It's all been an identity he's trying to push into the world. \n    Really cool people don't talk about how cool they are (like how you have to talk to Clara to see her accomplishments). In the same way that rich people don't talk about being rich. They just, are.\n     There's a ton that goes into this. Guy probably taps into improvisation, humor, self deprecating humor, and honesty. Clara: humbleness, self assuredness, people skills, listening skills. John sounds more like social dynamics, body language, flirting and how to display. \n   Any and all of these things are things you can learn, just keep an eye on being you. It's just a waste of time (imo) for someone to learn how to be magnetic, and then just bullshit everyone all the time.\n   Goodluck -some random dude from Longisland", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3r2jf0/how_to_be_magnetic/cwkcqs5/"}
