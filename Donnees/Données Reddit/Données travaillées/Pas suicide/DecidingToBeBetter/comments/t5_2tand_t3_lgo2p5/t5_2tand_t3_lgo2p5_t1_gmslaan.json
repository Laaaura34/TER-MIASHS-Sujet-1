This hit very close to home. I\u2019m in the same situation as you. I\u2019m talking to this girl and she\u2019s super great. But a lot of the times I feel like I\u2019m not worth it. I\u2019ve even talked to her about this and she\u2019s so understanding and sweet. But I still can\u2019t wrap my head around it just like you said. Maybe try being open with him about where you are mentally and if you need some time to yourself let him know! From what you\u2019ve described he should be open to working with you and helping you heal. That\u2019s all the advice I can give you at this time. Hopefully we both find peace of mind soon. Much love!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lgo2p5/can_anyone_with_mental_issues_actually_lead_a/gmslaan/"}
