I am going to therapy regularly, my therapist advice a way to cope with another problem that I had. She mentioned that this method is also used for recovering from addictions like smoking, phone etc.\n\nThe idea is that when you want to reach your phone, and when you are aware of that you are going for it, you pause. You take your 5 minutes and all of the time, you think about why you want to reach your phone. Try to do it every time that you are aware of what you are doing. Start to increase the time of thinking every 5 days or every week. \n\nTo understand yourself better, you can get a piece of paper and a pen to write down your thoughts, when you start your thinking session. Writing down helped me a lot about my first problem. It makes you see yourself from a better perspective. \n\nIt may sound  cliche but I highly recommend going to therapy, if you have the time and money.
