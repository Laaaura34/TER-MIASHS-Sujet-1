No doubt as you continue to build a life away from your toxic ex you'll find that you're able to feel fulfilled with the life you have right now and no longer \"want\" so many things. \n\nBeing in a toxic relationship leaves holes in our emotional fulfillment and it is totally normal to fall into the habit of trying to fill up that hole with \"wants\" disguised as needs. Because back then you DID need more than you were getting from your relationship! So it was normal (if not ideal) to try to solve the puzzle of what you were missing with stuff - the world is full of people telling you that is what you should do (ads lol). \n\nReally dig into your long term happiness and your gratitude with the every day and you'll find that YOU are the best person to fill those emotional holes -  not other people, not things, not spending money. You're the person who knows the shape of those holes best and, with time and practice, can craft the \"just right\" piece to fill in your emotional life. \n\nPlus the more money you save, the more buffer room you give yourself to grow and avoid being \"stuck\" in a toxic relationship again - financial liquid freedom of choice is POWERFUL.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gmcvbc/just_paid_of_4500_of_credit_card_debt/fr4gwfy/"}
