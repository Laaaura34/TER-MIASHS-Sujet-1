I put down my vape for good almost 3 full years ago now. I promise, the shitty feelings go away and you **will** get to a point where you won't crave a cigarette when you see someone smoking. \n\n\nIf you find you're really, really struggling, I recommend looking into using an NRT product like patches, gum or lozenges. For me, switching from vape to nicotine lozenges was crucial in getting my nic intake under control, making it easier to slowly ween down. \n\nThey're the cheapest at Target if you have those near you. Good luck!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mknqpu/today_is_the_first_day_of_quitting_juuling/gti2stn/"}
