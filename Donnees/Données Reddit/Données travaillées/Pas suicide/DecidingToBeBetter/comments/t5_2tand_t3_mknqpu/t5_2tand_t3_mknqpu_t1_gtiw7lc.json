My fianc\u00e9 and I are the same! Smokers since high school and then switched to vaping about 2 1/2 years ago Bc we thought it would help us quit and I find myself vaping more than I ever smoked. We\u2019re trying to quit as well and substitute it with exercise. So far we\u2019ve not been successful but we also haven\u2019t exactly put our heart and soul into it yet; I\u2019m hoping we can do it, but more importantly- I hope that you can do this and I\u2019m sure that you will! Keep us posted! Thank you for sharing your story, it makes me want to get more motivated. Sending you well-wishes and positivity!! YOU GOT THIS!\n\nP.S. I\u2019m not sure how reliable this is or accurate, but I\u2019ve had people recommend getting the super strong altoids and eating those instead of vaping Bc the combination of having something in your mouth and the strong flavor is supposed to help. I haven\u2019t tried this and I\u2019m not sure if it works, but I figured I\u2019d pass this tidbit along because not only are you trying to break an actual addiction, you\u2019re trying to break two- the oral fixation and the nicotine. I\u2019d love to hear any tips or tricks you may have that have helped you.
