I quit juuling on 9/1/2019 and it was one of the best things I've ever done for my health and mind.  First three months were killer, but freedom from the tyranny of that thing is so worth it.  I joined a stopsmoking community that really helped.  Having a tribe to help when it gets tough was essential.  Not worrying about all the sugar I craved at first was also key- turns out juul pods affect your blood sugar.  \n\nBest of luck!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mknqpu/today_is_the_first_day_of_quitting_juuling/gtib65t/"}
