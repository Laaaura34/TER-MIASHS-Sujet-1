I was thoroughly addicted to Juul for 2 years. Hit it as soon as I woke up till the very second I fell asleep. I would burn a pod a day. I quit cold turkey after I read this scientific report on how it damages your brains stem cells, switched to nicotine gum which was really difficult for 2 weeks. Now I can hit one of my friends vapes and be like \u201cthat was nice but Jesus I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t buy them anymore\u201d. It feels so much better to not be a slave to a habit, and also it increased my productivity because if your mind isn\u2019t constantly stimulated by a drug, you seek it in other, healthier places", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mknqpu/today_is_the_first_day_of_quitting_juuling/gth5gai/"}
