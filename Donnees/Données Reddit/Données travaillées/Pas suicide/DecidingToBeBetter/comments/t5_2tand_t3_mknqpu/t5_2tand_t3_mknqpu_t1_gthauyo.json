The problem for me was that it's not *just* the decision, by then it's too late, it's the entire conversation with the little voice in my head that leads up to the decision, breaking it down so that I could pick up on when I was starting to have these \"justifying conversations\" with myself made it much easier to \"change the topic\" so to speak, then I don't have to try and fight my subconscious on a decision that's essentially already been made 15 minutes ago or whatever.\n\nAgain, I understand that therapy is not a suitable option for everyone, hell these days it's not an affordable or accessible option for most. But if you have the opportunity I'd say go for it. At the very least try to look into CBT, specifically mindfulness, that's been a huge help for me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mknqpu/today_is_the_first_day_of_quitting_juuling/gthauyo/"}
