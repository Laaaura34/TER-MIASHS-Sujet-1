I was already hypervigilant when I tried to date again and when we broke up in good terms I've had my trust crushed a few months later. Now I want to keep myself single for some good fucking years and never really compromise with anyone in the mean time, mostly because you can't be betrayed if there's nothing to be betrayed on. One of the things I want the most is to be capable of going through a day without ever thinking about wether I could ever find someone truly trustful or not. I hope the book OP talked about can shed some light on this", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mylvz1/i_finally_found_a_book_about_cognitive_behavioral/gvx3848/"}
