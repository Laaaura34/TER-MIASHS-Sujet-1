I started therapy and my therapist recommended I read this book, so I have an understanding of how PTSD and C-PTSD (what I\u2019ve got) has developed as a diagnosis and it\u2019s history of understanding. Complete eye opener of a book. It\u2019s brought me a lot of peace to understand that the way I function and exist in this world isn\u2019t just me, it\u2019s completely normal given the environment I was raised in. And now I\u2019m able to set boundaries with myself and others while I work on different coping skills and building life skills I should have learned a long time ago.\n\nHonestly I feel that book should just be required reading material for all people entering adulthood; college age kids. It\u2019s really eye opening.\n\nI also have OCD, so I\u2019ll have to check out this book too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mylvz1/i_finally_found_a_book_about_cognitive_behavioral/gvwkbra/"}
