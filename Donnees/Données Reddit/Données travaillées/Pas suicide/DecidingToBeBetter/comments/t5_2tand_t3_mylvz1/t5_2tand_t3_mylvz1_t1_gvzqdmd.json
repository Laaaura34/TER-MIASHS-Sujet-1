I am in a fantastic relationship. Married for the first time, age 63 not even a year. And I am about to ruin it with my jealousy issues. Same thing, obsessively checking FB,Twitter, Instagram. He is the best ever and not exhibited any behavior or inappropriate  responses that I've found. Social media has been a HUGE culprit. I fucking hate it, a necessary evil for classes requiring community (for me), otherwise I'd dump it. If I'm not on there I'm not checking. My husband is on there all the time... ex-girfriends, wives, they all go back and forth bantering... I can't put my foot down, he's not really doing anything but I must find a way to cope with this before I go off the chain... I'll read your suggestion... I think I need traditional therapy too. Thanks for posting this, I feel a little better knowing I'm not the only one who has this issue.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mylvz1/i_finally_found_a_book_about_cognitive_behavioral/gvzqdmd/"}
