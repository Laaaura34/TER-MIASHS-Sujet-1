The day i realised my same thoughts in my relationship were from my ocd was such a game changer. I have always had ocd but never realised it had jumped ship onto my relationship \n\n\nI am definitely going to read this book because it will only further help so thank you!\n\nA friend of mine recommended medication to me and im so grateful vecause it has helped me so insanely much and truly saved my life. Just looking at where I was even a year ago.\n\nAlso, you saying how you no longer feel crazy- i soooo know that feeling! Realising my condition wasn't me has honestly made me the happiest person and has helped me overcome a lot, because I was in a consent cycle of self loathing and feeling I was an awful person and emotionally abusive etc. And as soon as I started to realise and work on myself with a therapist and talking to friends and being on medication, that all changed and I feel happier than I ever have before.\n\nI am so grateful you have shared this book! Thank you! And I am so happy for your new outlook on life ans yourself. You deserve the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mylvz1/i_finally_found_a_book_about_cognitive_behavioral/gvw55i9/"}
