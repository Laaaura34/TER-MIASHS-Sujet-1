I am Diagnosed with OCD and a few other things and lately it feels like it's getting worse. I've been to the Psychiatrist and I feel like this is something I need to tackle myself more. I work alone in a studio and yesterday I missed my public transport because I couldn't stop checking my door, leaving, and going back to check the door was locked even though I knew. Nine times. I've been thinking about it all morning, and then I jumped on here and saw this. I'm going to see if the book is available here in Australia.
