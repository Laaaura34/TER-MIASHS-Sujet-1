Congratulations!!  I want to move away from my hometown. I could make twice my salary or more if I did. It\u2019s very hard to move to a new place, no friends there, new job.. So as for myself I\u2019m kind of stagnating. I\u2019ve got 15 years experience in my profession, I\u2019m 49, no marriage, no kids. I feel that if I stay here, I will always wonder \u201cwhat if.\u201d I\u2019m very happy for you! My Mom isn\u2019t thrilled at the prospect of me moving away but she gets it. She doesn\u2019t think I will. I think I will but not quite yet.
