They are probably worried you are moving away and that makes the sad but that is being selfish. My son just move away from Pineville, NC  to Maryland. I wasnt happy about it, but he has to live his life. Be happy and dont let others hold you back. I have 4 kids and would never hold them back. I always encourage them to do better for themselves, if need be, no matter where it takes them. Good luck and God bless.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pr9ijc/no_one_in_my_immediate_family_is_happy_for_me_but/hdh58m0/"}
