Your immediate family are satisfied with the status quo that works for THEM, not for YOU, and may even depend on USING YOU for THEIR egos & neediness.   My wife & I felt like we had to dance to everyone else's tune.  I was the 'fixer' for other's careless negligence, she was the bottom of the pecking order in her family.  So we married & moved 350 miles away.  Far enough to avoid all the drama, close enough to visit on a weekend, then escape again.  It's been 27 years, we live OUR lives, focus on OUR interests, support each other, stay out of their negativity & weird dramas; it's been great!\n\nYour family SHOULD be your top supporters; if they're not, take that as proof you're doing exactly the right thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pr9ijc/no_one_in_my_immediate_family_is_happy_for_me_but/hdhcqxo/"}
