But then I realised that putting the expectation on myself that I shouldn't cry was only adding another layer of suffering to my experience. It caused me to avoid asking for help and withdraw when I faced difficult situations, because I felt too embarrassed to show my vulnerability around other people. I've come to realise that crying is a healthy expression of emotion and should not be suppressed. \n\nI hope you don't mind me saying, but it seems like the situation you actually need to concentrate on improving is living with emotionally abusive parents. I wish you all the best with that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oczq1s/as_an_adult_with_problems_im_just_wondering_if/h3yb19d/"}
