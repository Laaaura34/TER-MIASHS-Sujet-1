As you say, You ARE an adult. There is no reason you need to remain in a situation where you are mistreated. It would seem that you have become accustomed to this treatment having grown up with it and don't realize that you have the ability to completely change your life. \nMake a list of what you need to do to get out from under your parent's control and get to it! If you need a job,a place to live, transportation...start looking NOW! The question isn't if it's OK to react any specific way as an adult, it is how can you have a fulfilling and happy life that gives you everything you desire? Go out and create the life yu choose.
