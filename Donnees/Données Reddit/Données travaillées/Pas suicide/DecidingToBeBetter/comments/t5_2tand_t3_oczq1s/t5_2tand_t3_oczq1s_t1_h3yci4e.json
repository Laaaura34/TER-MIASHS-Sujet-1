These are just human things but for some reason it has been stereotyped as an embarrassment. Bascially humans have emotions. One most important thing about emotions is once you show what you are feeling, the feeling goes automatically. Emotions are too be expressed but society has a stereotype that a person who stays cold is far superior. Lmao that is just bullshit. \nIf you feel like crying please cry if you dont want people to look at you while crying. Find a secure place to cry and let go off your emotions.
