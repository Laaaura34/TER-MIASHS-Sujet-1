I have 2 nieces on the Autistic spectrum. One lived with me for a couple of years. She tried volunteering, I put her in counseling, she tried college.... nothing worked. She basically wanted to be on disability because she was unable to functionin society due to anxiety and PTSD. Neither of her parents not I were willing to take care of her for the rest of her life so she went online and found people who would let her crash for a month or two. If no\\_end doesn't have any marketable skills and has no support system then they have very few choices other than staying or homelessness. Both completely suck. However they are not alone. Lots of others are out there on the spectrum and function with varying degrees of success. My advice is to try to get out of the house as often as possible. Libraries, parks, any place you can be alone and feel safe. Once you start to see that there is something else other than your homebound prison you may find the courage to build a life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oczq1s/as_an_adult_with_problems_im_just_wondering_if/h3yxxmu/"}
