If accepting your emotions, circumstances, or actions causes you to cry in the process, that's okay and is just you processing things. If however you use crying as a defense mechanism to avoid how you really feel about something, then the crying is toxic and hinders your development. So no there is nothing wrong with crying in general, but whether it is good for you completely depends on how it is being used.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oczq1s/as_an_adult_with_problems_im_just_wondering_if/h3y62jd/"}
