I don't care how tough you are. There are times that you are gonna need to do that and you don't have to do it in public or in front of everyone but you can let it out in private. \n\nNow I didn't like the profanity but I think the point is even \"aggressive AF hyper masculine men\" will cry hard even if on the outside to the public they don't show it. \n\nClowns cry hardest so even comedians do it. Actors do it. Sports fans do it. Pro competitors do it. We all do it even if we don't show it and you don't release it it's just gonna be boiling under the surface. \n\nI think people are afraid to show the emotions publicly because they will either look like a bitch and appear weak or they are afraid it might backfire such as other people adding to the problem i.e. narcisstic parents. \n\nIf you need help I actually looked up YouTube videos on how to cry from actors and they gave some pretty cool tips on how to do that. Additionally one can sulk to music so it might take a bit of time but it might let out the feels even if it's not explicitly. I have sat next to some songs and just sulked and could hear the crying inside even if not outside or having tears rolling down. Usually after 30 mins of effort it will come. \n\nIt's like constipation but eventually the poop gets pooped.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oczq1s/as_an_adult_with_problems_im_just_wondering_if/h3zy5u1/"}
