I would never even have that thought in mind makes it alot easier. You aren't competing with anyone, it does not matter how much money you make, your looks, size or age. If something you cannot change doesn't go your way, move on. If you don't you will either go crazy or exacerbate the process of moving on. Now, be honest with yourself with this one. How selfishly are you living your life? Also, how much energy do you put into helping others feel good vs energy helpinf yourself feel good? This is solely based on observation but the majority of people I've seen who spend most of their time devoted to helping  others, and seeing the positive in others generally have more. I mean it pretty much is one of the only areas in which our brain differs from a monkey. Those types that don't have much money or possesions don't care one bit. That's because its a serenity to have full controll over your life like you always have and always will. Personal pleasures are nice and needed some times. Too much though, will leave you selfish, alone and eventually empty and depressed.
