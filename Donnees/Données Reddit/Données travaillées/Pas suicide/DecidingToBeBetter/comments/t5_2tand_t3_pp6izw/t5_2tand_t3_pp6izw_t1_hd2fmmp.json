A single piece of cake, a few cookies, etc and I completely eliminated candy altogether. I stay within +/-20 percent of the recommended sugar intake. I was extremely disappointed when this \"it's the best I've ever felt\" feeling did not manifest for me as I literally noticed no change whatsoever. I maintain it because it is the healthier option and I'd like to hopefully reap the benefits down the line, but I'd really caution against overselling the immediate changes to people because not everyone gets them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pp6izw/gone_a_month_without_sugar/hd2fmmp/"}
