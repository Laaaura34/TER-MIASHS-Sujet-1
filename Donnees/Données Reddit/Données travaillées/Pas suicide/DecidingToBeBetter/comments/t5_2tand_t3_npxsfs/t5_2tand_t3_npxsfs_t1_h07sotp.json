You don\u2019t.\nPorn makes you unappreciate your partner. You need to knock your ego down imagining you could bring a different girl home daily, but honestly, even if you could, is that what you really want? A different girl every day? It gets old fast. And these girls, do you think they\u2019d (truly, not faking) moan for you like the girls on the screen? That you can satisfy all of them? \n\nAlso, regarding your relationship, you should give some thought to whether or not that\u2019s what you want right now. If you truly want to sow your wild oats and you keep lying to yourself about it, you will most definitely end up ruining your relationship one way or another. Take a good hard look at yourself, get some therapy if you can afford it, be honest with what you want.
