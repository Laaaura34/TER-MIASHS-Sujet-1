If you want something go for it. No one is going to do it for you and you will have only yourself to beat up about it. I know, because I am you_ you are me- we all have deep seeded anxiety. We are all worthy of Love and with that comes the possibilities of failure.. but to fail is not to be be a failure in ones self; It is simply an indicator of work still needed to be done. We can fail an exorbitant amount of times, yet that doesn\u2019t in itself make us failures. We fail when we tell ourselves we are not capable, we are lesser that those who can..  for failure is a mindset not a characteristic of man. \nFor all the  times we fill our own hearts with doubt- Tell yourself, \u201cI am good enough, I deserve love, I will try, I am allowed to fail, my failures do not define me. In general we have one voice in our own minds, it\u2019s yours - You have to power to be kind or to torment yourself. So treat yourself the way you would like others to treat you. Would you tell your friends they are failures for making a mistake? We generally don\u2019t provide ourselves the same leeway we dole out to our loved ones.
