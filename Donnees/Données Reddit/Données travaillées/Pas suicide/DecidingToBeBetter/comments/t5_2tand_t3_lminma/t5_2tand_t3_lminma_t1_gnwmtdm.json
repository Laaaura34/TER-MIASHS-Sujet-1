There was a common theme in my entries \"quit weed, quit nicotine ....\" as well as those same tasks sitting there incomplete. I began to ask myself, why do I feel so behind?? Then one morning something clicked, I decided I had enough of not getting  stuff done that I needed to. \n\nIt began really small mind you, it all started with Journaling, which led to making my bed in the morning, which led to focusing on one task instead of many... and so on. Eventually I started to become a lot more productive, and I realized that I can't live a completely productive lifestyle if I'm stoned everyday. Nicotine and porn were thrown in because I'm tired of having high anxiety and the jitters. \n\nSorry if this answer seems incomplete, you asked a really good question.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lminma/decided_to_quit_porn_weed_and_nicotine_all_cold/gnwmtdm/"}
