I commend you for wanting to make moves for the better in your life. Especially at such a young age. I'm 52 and only in the past 10 years had the strength to snuff my addictions (drinking and pills). Trust me when I tell ya, you'll be better off in the long run. Congrats. If you're this mindful now, I have no doubt you'll succeed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lminma/decided_to_quit_porn_weed_and_nicotine_all_cold/gnyrkbm/"}
