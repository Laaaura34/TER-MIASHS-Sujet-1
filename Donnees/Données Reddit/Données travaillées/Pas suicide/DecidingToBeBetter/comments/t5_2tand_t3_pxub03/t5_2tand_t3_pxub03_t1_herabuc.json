But you really did the right thing. A person who truly loves and can't be without you would try their best to show you that love that you so rightfully deserve. Comfortability can only keep you \"happy\" for so long. If anything, happiness doesn't really fit the feeling. It's more of comfortable sedation. I'm sure he was a kind man. But anyone can be kind. It's rather easy. You shouldn't spend the rest of your human existence with someone who can't initiate intimacy, never expresses his love, who won't even try to make you feel special because he worries you will become \"superficial.\"  How utterly ridiculous. Life and love should be passionate. \n\nBeing 32 means nothing. So fucking what. Would you rather be 42 and still be in a passionless-roommate style relationship with a man who doesn't care about your feelings? In this context, your age really doesn't matter. You have so much life ahead of you. Go out into the world with passion in your heart, and find what you are looking for. Don't just settle for any \"nice guy.\" Ignite your lust for love and life now. Your life isn't over. It really began the day you realized your worth and what you truly deserve.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/herabuc/"}
