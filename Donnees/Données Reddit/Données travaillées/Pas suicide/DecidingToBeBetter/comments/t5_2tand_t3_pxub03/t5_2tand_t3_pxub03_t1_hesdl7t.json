Which surprises me because for a long time, I thought I was alone. \n\nI was in your shoes roughly 4 years ago. I\u2019m also an expat and I too, was in a terrible financial situation where my ex earned roughly 2x what I got paid. I\u2019m also a minority in this country. But I left, started over, found a wonderful man, and he makes me feel loved every day. It\u2019s never too late to start over and i have faith in you that you\u2019ll find happiness again with someone that deserves your love", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/hesdl7t/"}
