I'm a gay man.  My partner and I had a great time for the first few months.  Shortly after moving in, he decided he didn't enjoy sex or intimacy or anything.  He would lecture me about being more \"manly\" and not expressing myself so much.  He is from China and I get that Chinese people tend to be closed to expressions like this - but he blamed EVERYTHING on being Chinese and it became too irritating to handle.\n\nI was with him for three years.  The last 2.5 were bad.  We were both codependent on one another and it was bad.  I had to end it because I have a high sex drive and simply couldn't handle it.  He belittled my sexual and romantic needs and made me feel like shit - which I'm still recovering from.\n\nPeople can learn to express love differently, but if they don't want to try, they won't.  Mine refused to try and I owed it to myself to move on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/heq9gt9/"}
