I was near suicidal. I just did not want to do that to my kids. And one of my kids is disabled and I couldnt imagine what life would have been like for him especially. So I hung in there. I also got personally very religious. Kept praying. Novenas. All these \"get your man back get your life back\" prayers. Desperation. Didnt change the situation. I was a SAHM for so long, and he bled us dry (drugs, other comments explain it).  Destitute even for a while, thank goodness for family.  Then I was like, ok, I can get a job in retail, and I tried some programs which did not help (job training/career change). I thought I would never have a relationship again.  Did not really want one. Started dating. Fell in love a couple of times, puppy love. Still friends with some people I fell for.  Then met a guy who was just supposed to be a couple of drinks, maybe a hookup. That was Feb 2018. We live together and plan on getting a house together and getting married. COVID kind of slowed our roll.  But I just took it day by day and got therapy, and just...tenacious my therapist called me. EDIT: And resilient. No idea where it came from, but there it was. Wow, didntk now how much my life sucked before, LOL, I am so happy now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/het568t/"}
