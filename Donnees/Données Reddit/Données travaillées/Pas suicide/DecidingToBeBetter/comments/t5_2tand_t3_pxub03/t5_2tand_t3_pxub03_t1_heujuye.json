The way you were explaing his behavior kind of reminded me of some of my reactions to a relationship l use to have at the time l felt real back l can't give love like he wasn't me to and the intimate parts were scattered (l was full of alot of guilt and question) resent ly l found out that was normal for  demisexual (sequel orientation)  it under the asexual spectrum.  We can be in a relaxed but what bonds us is the deep  emotional connected (the demisexual)  but what you mostly explained reminds me of asexual but l might be wrong as well just wanted to put it out there. It can be tough when everything is going great except the part that you personally want but they can't provide \n\nWish you best of love you got this girl ! \ud83d\udc96\n\nIf it helps abit am start to find my career part in my 30s first semester this fall.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/heujuye/"}
