Honestly, everything you said after you being \u2018compatible in nearly everything\u2019 explained exactly how you are not compatible. Also, if he loved you and was loyal even as a friend, he wouldn\u2019t basically put you on the street after the breakup. Also, 32 is incredibly young!! I understand the feeling left behind other women at that age but personally I started life over at 33 (am 37 now) and am so effing happy I did. I focused on me and my mental health. I know what I want now. I have boundaries now. I have enough self esteem to demand my needs in all my interactions. Other people\u2019s lives don\u2019t affect my life or choices, no matter how close they are to me. Also, dating never stops. I haven\u2019t left the house since the pandemic and don\u2019t go to clubs or parties or clubs at all but have been getting texts and calls from potential suitors the entire time. Again, 37. Finding a partner should not be a focus or worry right now. IVF for family will be available and likely more advanced when you\u2019re ready. Jennifer Lopez, Mariah Carey, Chrissy Tiegan, Michelle Obama and many many many more womenall used IVF to have families in their late 30s and 40s. You can\u2019t afford to worry about finding someone to fit your imagined timeline. after you get yourself mentally trained to not let things that bother you slide. You\u2019ll be great! In most cases, starting over is good. Honestly starting anything over is great. You literally have a blank slate and can design the very long life you\u2019re going to live to ensure you are mentally and emotionally ready for any future stumbling blocks. Good luck, you\u2019re awesome and ask google or Alexa for a compliment for a moment.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/heswdkh/"}
