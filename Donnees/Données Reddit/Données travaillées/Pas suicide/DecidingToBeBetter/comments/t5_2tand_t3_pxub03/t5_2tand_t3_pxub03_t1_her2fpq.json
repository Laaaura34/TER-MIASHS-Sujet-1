My ex was quite similar, unable to express affection and unwilling to initiate much. I would like to believe that if he had genuinely worked on it, it would yield (some) success. \n\nHave you guys tried couples counselling? Or just.. being explicit about communication/showing affection? Maybe he needs to make an effort to pay you a compliment or initiate intimacy once a week and you need to accept that over spontaneous actions of affection? Idk, I wish it works for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/her2fpq/"}
