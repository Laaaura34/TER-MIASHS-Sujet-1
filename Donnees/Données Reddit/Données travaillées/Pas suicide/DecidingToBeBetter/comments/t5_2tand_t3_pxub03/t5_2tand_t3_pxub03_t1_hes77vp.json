Although I don\u2019t have a concrete reason behind why my sex drive isnt as high anymore, I just don\u2019t feel the constant need to jump her bones which makes her upset. Both codependent on each other. I think deep down we both know we might not be sexually compatible but we don\u2019t want to act on it. \n\nWhat would you recommend to try? We\u2019re still intimate but we ~get it on~ maybe 6 times a month, compared to daily in the first few months. We\u2019ve tried scheduling days for sex and new toys etc. I\u2019ve tried to make her feel wanted but it\u2019s still not enough.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/hes77vp/"}
