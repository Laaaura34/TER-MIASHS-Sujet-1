You are obviously in a good place maybe partially because of the high expectations placed on you.  That obviously came with a lot of pressure and negative consequences. The more you focus on how insecure or hurt the people were that made you feel less than, the more you will feel what you are, a successful, worthy person deserving all of the wonderful things that come to you.\n\nI know it sounds a little cheesy but it does work if you do it enough.  Also, I highly encourage you to associate with people who do not make you feel less than.  It is a lot harder to change the way you feel if you are still getting the same message over and over.\n\nI will tell you that you are not entitled or selfish but it will be so much better when you feel it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gj6vjg/i_just_want_to_hear_someone_tell_me_that_im_doing/fqqq2qs/"}
