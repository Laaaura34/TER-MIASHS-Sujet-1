I didn't like other girls hanging around him and I felt very subconscious that he would leave me for someone better. It never gets easier, which is disheartening, but you have to understand that he is choosing you and if you trust him that's all that matters. \n\nLike your bf, my husband is well liked and seems to always be able to carry on conversations. He ls also hot, smart, and kind. It's hard to not be worried about losing him because I love him so much and he seems so put together compared to me. Makes all the right decisions, says all the right things. \n\nIt's going to take time to change being jealous and you just have to work on it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgq21p/im_tired_of_being_an_envious_and_jealous_person/hi82ktr/"}
