I started practicing gratitude when I got really sick. I was in a really bad place mentally because I couldn't work, couldn't do my hobbies, and every day kind of felt like it was defined by how sick I was or how much I had lost or couldn't do. \n\nSo when I first started it was things like: I'm greatful that I was able to make lunch for myself today. I am greatful that I live in a place where nature is right outside my door. I am greatful for the sunshine and that I have a garden to sit in and enjoy it. And now it is things like: I'm greatful my partner makes me amazing coffee, I am greatful to have a job that allows me to work from home and is disability friendly, I am greatful I have internet to enjoy Netfix. \n\nIt was really difficult at first because I felt like, is my life that shit that I have to resort to being greatful I put a wash on?? But I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/WPPPFqsECz0) and bought their gratitude journal and it helped reframe it for me. My brain is 10/10 at noticing negative things but less skilled at noticing the good things in my life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kyikvj/gratitude_has_changed_my_life/gjhhflf/"}
