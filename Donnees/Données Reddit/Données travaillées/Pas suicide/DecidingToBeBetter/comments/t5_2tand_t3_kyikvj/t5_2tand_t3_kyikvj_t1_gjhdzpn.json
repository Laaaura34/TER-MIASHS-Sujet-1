It made me so much happier! Has had a long term effect. One of the main things was that I was deeply unhappy with my job because it\u2019s a small business and my boss sometimes does weird dodgy stuff regarding paying me. \n\nThrough listing what I\u2019m grateful for I realized how many positives my job has that I wasn\u2019t seeing because of that one negative. (Positives: super close to home, great hours, freedom in how I do my job, independence, get to help people, actually do get paid decently). \n\nI learnt to trust in myself that I will be able to confront her and resolve the issue if she messes with my pay. Now I\u2019m so much happier.\n\nMindset is a powerful thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kyikvj/gratitude_has_changed_my_life/gjhdzpn/"}
