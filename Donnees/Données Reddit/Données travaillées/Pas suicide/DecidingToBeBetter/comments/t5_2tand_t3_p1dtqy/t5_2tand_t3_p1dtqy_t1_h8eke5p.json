I live in a small town, so it's hard to get work. \n\nMy self esteem isn't too bad at the moment, but I'm 23 living at home, and being broke and at home everyday is getting quite sickening. I'm still constantly applying for jobs, just haven't been lucky in getting one, despite having three job interviews since.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1dtqy/i_finally_found_a_job/h8eke5p/"}
