Absolutely beautiful! \n\nI used to be the same way- always felt I needed to stand up for myself against those who misunderstood/spoke poorly of me. What's helpful to remember is that you are a mirror for those who you interact with. The things that they are so upset and worked up about, the negative aspects they see within you that have them pestering you relentlessly, are things that they recognize within themselves or within their own lives.\n\nAdditionally, they do not and cannot ever actually know \"you.\" They have their ideas, but all of their ideas are based on their own life experiences. We can only know and understand that which we ourselves have experienced. Nothing they are saying holds any validity and at some point or another knowing this will be enough for you. You will own your self worth and love yourself so unconditionally that you'll recognize any energy spent responding to such hurtful and hate-filled individuals is energy wasted. There is no changing minds or opinions. You do you, be you, for you. That's all that matters!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kv9hz0/for_the_first_time_in_25_years_instead_of/giwz131/"}
