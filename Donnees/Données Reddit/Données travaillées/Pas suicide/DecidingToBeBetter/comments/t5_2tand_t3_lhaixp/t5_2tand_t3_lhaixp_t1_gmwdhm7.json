I'm glad I was able to help. I volunteer a lot of my free time and I really enjoy it so I always point it out as an option to people who are looking for something to make themselves feel good by doing something good!!\n\nLike I said, you made a mistake, but that's all you did. Look at some pictures of dogs (or blow dried cows if you've never seen any!!!), let yourself relax, maybe sleep on it and tomorrow will be a different day, and it'll already seem less scary.\n\nBest of luck to you \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lhaixp/did_something_illegal_and_stupid/gmwdhm7/"}
