I'm a woman and it never bothers me when people say something chatty to me while I am in line somewhere or at a grocery store or something like that. If a woman doesn't want to talk to you it is easy enough for her to just smile or agree and then just keep going about her business. Women usually just get annoyed when guys keep talking despite not getting much of a response.\n\nIt's also very offputting when guys come in super hot, e.g. I have had a stranger stop me to tell me I have nice arms. I also had someone at a conference come up to tell me I was \"killing it in my heels\" which honestly made me feel super bad because it is not like I was at a club... I was at my job. It's such a clear signal that I wasn't being thought of as a professional or a person.\n\nIt is easier said than done but try not to frame the goal as getting a phone number, so it doesn't feel like a \"miss\" if you don't. Just think of it as practicing talking to women. Any pleasant exchange is a win and the rest is just bonus. Remember, some people chat just to chat and it doesn't always have to be to make a connection.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dxgxp1/i_saw_a_beautiful_woman_in_an_art_museum/f7tid6b/"}
