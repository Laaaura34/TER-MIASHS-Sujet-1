A museum is perfectly acceptable public place to introduce yourself to someone. It\u2019s not like the gym. If the girls body language implied she wanted to be left alone then fair enough, don\u2019t approach. \n\nIf he opened to the girl, perhaps making a remark at an exhibit they were both looking at, and she clearly showed a response showing she wanted to be left alone then OP should just abort within 30 seconds. \n\nBut it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to give it a shot. Your comment doesn\u2019t factor in OP\u2019s desire to establish a human connection with a girl he\u2019s interested in at all, you\u2019re only speaking from your own personal antisocial behaviour. Perhaps this girl loves to chat at the museum ? You don\u2019t know.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dxgxp1/i_saw_a_beautiful_woman_in_an_art_museum/f7rbjng/"}
