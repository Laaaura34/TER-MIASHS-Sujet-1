I'd say it seems you were very active , maybe try adding some physical active like running or joining a team again. It might tire you enough to get better sleep. Joining a team might also help you make some friend which might make you feel better if they're nice people.\n\n\nAlso just some I guess information from my experience. Thank God that high school was not the best years of my life.  Life really begins when you get freedom you dont have from school. If you work hard and try different things there's so much you can do and experience.  Alot of my friends now that I'm older say high school was just a blip. Its important to educate yourself and go to college or university if you can afford it/plan for it but I'm sure you'll have a better time out of school! Especially you said yourself you seem smart.\n\n:) theres better things to come. Try to get threw this final push of high school to go to better things.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/icc6vg/ive_17f_decided_to_be_betterbut_have_no_idea/g23uc1p/"}
