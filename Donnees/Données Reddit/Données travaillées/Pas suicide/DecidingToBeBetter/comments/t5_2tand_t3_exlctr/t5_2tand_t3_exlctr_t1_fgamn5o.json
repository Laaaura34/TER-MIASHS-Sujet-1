How will her sister ever learn responsibility or independence if when she breaks something there is always a back up provided by someone else. Without even being respectful to the fact that it\u2019s being provided by someone else. \n\nAdditionally, It\u2019s the internet, social media , games, etc , she doesn\u2019t *need* 24/7 access at her age or any age. If anything I think her not having constant access to such things is probably better. I\u2019m female and grew up *with* the internet. Social media is toxic, especially to younger minds. \n\nIf she already feels like she can\u2019t go without it then it\u2019s a sign of an issue that goes beyond even this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/exlctr/i_changed_the_passwords_on_all_of_my_devices_so/fgamn5o/"}
