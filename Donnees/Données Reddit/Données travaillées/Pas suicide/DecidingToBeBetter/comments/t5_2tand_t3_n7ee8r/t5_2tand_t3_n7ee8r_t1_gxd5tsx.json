I had everything ready, just needed to walk like 10 minutes. I have no one I can connect with, I purposefully didn't do any of my tasks so it all built up, I threw out things I loved, I sold stuff off, planned weeks before hand with absolute certainty it was gonna happen.\n\nBut I sat there, confused on why I felt no energy to walk out that door. I just went to bed. Knowing that when I wake up I'm gonna have to get everything I didn't do done (which was overwhelmingly a lot).\n\nI'm glad you're still here. There was something that stopped you, and that something will guide you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxd5tsx/"}
