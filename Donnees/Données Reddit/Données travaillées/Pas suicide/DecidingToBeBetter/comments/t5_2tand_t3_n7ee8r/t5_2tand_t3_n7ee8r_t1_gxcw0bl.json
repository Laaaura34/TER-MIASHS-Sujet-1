That\u2019s really shitty. I\u2019ve been going through a really rough time emotionally as well. Some days really suck to the point where I\u2019m questioning what even is the point of living and others are a bit better - just know you\u2019re not alone and I\u2019m also here if you want someone to talk to. \n\nLike others have mentioned, if you don\u2019t already have one, a counselor or therapist would be helpful to talk to. There\u2019s many options out there to explore to help pull you out of this dark place. There\u2019s hope and you\u2019re not alone. \ud83e\udde1", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxcw0bl/"}
