It hurts and you need a support system to help you. Reach out. I've been in that place many many times. Without my friends and loved ones there would be no me. Reach out and when someone holds out their hand grab it. Hold on. That darkness is so great and staring at the pit with no one makes falling so much more tempting.\n\nTake time. You have to start the hardest journey, processing that grief that is in you. The betrayal, the violation of trust, your past, your present. That grief is so big right now that it is blocking out those better days that the future can hold. It will not be easy, I won't lie, but you have to fight for your broken heart. You have to learn to love yourself and forgive the you that is hurting, accept that side of you because let's face it, when you've been taken advantage of you start to hate yourself. You hate that you were weak, that you trusted the wrong person, that if you were different these things would not have happened. Find someone that can help you process this grief. There are places that give you a safe place to talk. \n\nKeep your head up. Fight for yourself and know that people love you. Tomorrow is filled with so many possibilities.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxcsjf1/"}
