After that I really changed my views on life. I stopped trying to be that successful dude I was trying to be and just decided to take time for myself. Spent a whole year abroad thanks to a huge scholarship and never looked back. I became a more confident and likeable person, I feel great with who I am and have a few hobbies I can go to when feeling stressed.\nMoral of the story, as many others have said, you just want your current life to end, not to end with your life at all. So just do that, small steps will get you a huge way forward. I would recommend just taking a break (if possible) from your current life. If you can't do that at the moment, just try to do something kinda bold: picking up a new skill you always wanted to, study something new or making some friends.\n\nCongrats on realizing life is worth living, for some of us it took a while, but I can tell you is the best thing that will ever happen to you :)!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxe6njn/"}
