To feel alone and just want to cease to exist. I\u2019m glad you were able to overcome that feeling tonight. When times are better, you will also be glad you found the strength to keep those feelings at bay. It\u2019s easy to say and hard to do, but try to not let those feelings define your life (or it\u2019s end). Search for joy and companionship; it\u2019s out there. \n\nPersonally, I still have those thoughts every now and then. Some nights (it\u2019s always nights!) are worse than others, but I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve ignored them. Even though it has seemed utterly hopeless to find happiness at times, like there will be no brighter tomorrow, I\u2019m always proven wrong. Whether it was adopting my cat Maui or visiting my siblings and going to watch a movie... I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve stuck around. And I\u2019ve definitely improved at ignoring the thoughts.\n\nI don\u2019t know why you feel lonely, but if you need friends, you can make some here. Even if it\u2019s just to help pull you back from the edge on your worst days, there\u2019s people here that understand the feelings you\u2019re going through. Just reach out. You can always shoot me a message if you wanna talk with someone. (I\u2019m a guy, maybe you\u2019d like to find a girl to be more comfortable.) Don\u2019t do something irreversible without reaching out first. Sometimes we just need a little help telling our own brain to chill with the suicidal thoughts, and that it\u2019ll feel better in the morning.\n\nAlso, consider getting a pet if you don\u2019t have one. Sometimes they know when you\u2019re down and them coming to cuddle makes all the difference in the world on our darkest nights.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxdgee4/"}
