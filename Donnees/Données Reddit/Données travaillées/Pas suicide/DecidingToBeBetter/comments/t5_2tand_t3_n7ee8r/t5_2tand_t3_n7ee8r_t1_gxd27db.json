This subreddit has a lot of positivity and encouraging comments that I really needed to read and be reminded of. You're all wonderful and I appreciate every single one of your comments. It really means a lot that, we as a community, can come together and help one another out. This has been a beautiful decision and laying in bed seeing such kindness really solidifies that making my choice was the right thing for me. I know we are all stranger to stranger due to social media, but this post has connected us all together. I may not be able to get to each individual comment because I honestly didn't expect this post to be recongized this vastly. I'm grateful that my choice has allowed us to come together and encourage each other. There is great advice being given and a whole lot of genuine people. It means a lot, I thank all of you. You really made me smile and feel reassured. This is a reminder that we truly aren't alone and that you are valued. Thank you all so much.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxd27db/"}
