Keep working on you and your life WILL change. It feels like baby steps but every step makes a difference. \n\nI'll share my story. This time last year I was addicted to marijuana. I had a psychotic break in Feb 2020. My dad was becoming increasingly violent. He sexually abused me for many years as a child. I found a childhood journal of mine. It didn't explicitly say he was r**ing me but it was clear being written by a child. It's hard to explain without really going in depth. Anyway, I wrote in sharpie on the journal that I knew he molested me and they're the reasons I did meth and drank and couldn't hold a job. They're the reasons I cut myself. I tried to kill myself.\n\nAnd then I left. I ended up in another state, in the woods, naked. Like I said, I had a psychotic break. Anyway I was taken to the hospital. I wouldn't see or talk to my parents. The one time I talked to my mom I said I didn't feel safe coming home. She said I don't see why (mind you before I left she was literally texting me when it was safe to come back so I didn't run into my dad). I said because he abused me my whole life. She said \"I don't know where you think I was that that happened.\" I hung up. She knew. I knew she knew.\n\nI was discharged to a shelter. The day covid was declared a global pandemic. The shelter was a temporary stay and I had to go home.\n\nI was so scared. But my parents were a lot different. My dad had kidney issues before I left (why he was so agitated he was really sick). He had healed. He was retired and with covid didn't have to help my mom with her work (she was working from home). So he started baking and working in his garden. \n\nI did get a lock for my door. And a sound machine (I could hear him peeing through the bathroom walls and it was very triggering for me). June 6th 2020 I cut up my medical marijuana card. I got off all my psychiatric medication. In August 2020 I started a part time job. Which I held till the end of April. I quit because I got an amazing job at a university. And yesterday I signed a lease to my own place. I move in two weeks.\n\nIt sounds like a miracle but it's not. I did the work and I never gave up. I found a lot of comfort in spirituality, yoga, meditation, and the archangels. I would pray to them whenever I was really struggling. I had many days of crying and wishing I could just die. Nightmares of the abuse, of my dad. Which was so hard because then I had to see him. But here I am. And it sounds crazy but I actually have a good relationship with them now. They're hiring movers and offered to pay which is awesome because it'll be at least a grand. I suspect my dad was sexually and physically abused by his father. And not that it makes what he did to me okay but I forgive him. It's present tense because it's something I have to do consciously. I forgive my mom, who was r***d by her stepfather. And her mom didn't believe her. So she left home very young. \n\nMy honest advice for you is to try to get to a place financially where you can move into your own place. I knew I couldn't have roommates. I've struggled with substance abuse and couldn't have someone who parties or even just wants to have wine or beer in the house. Or smokes weed. Hearing sexual noises or just knowing someone was having a lot of casual sex would be a trigger for me too. \n\nI do think therapy can be helpful but it's hard to dive into trauma work if you're not in a safe place. I refused to talk about my childhood while living here. It was too triggering. But a therapist could help you with how to talk to your roommate. Or how to ground yourself during a flashback. \n\nI realize my comment was so long so I'm going to leave it here. But I just wanted to share because a year ago I wanted to die. And I chose to keep taking those baby steps. Quit weed, start caring for myself, part time job, and look at me now. I'm moving out! In two weeks! \n\nIt will get better. Just keep taking those steps \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc99\n\nP.S. something that helped me when I was really struggling, especially during weed withdrawals, was writing a list of what I was proud of myself for. I always included getting sober from alcohol and weed. Making it a year (now two) without cutting myself. Applying to jobs. Taking out the trash. Showering (which can be triggering for me), taking my dogs for a walk, waking up early. Like it could be anything. But it helped me to see I was doing the work. I did it right before bed and I'd remind myself good things are coming.\n\nCheck out the song Black As Night by Nahko \ud83d\udc99", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxdic3j/"}
