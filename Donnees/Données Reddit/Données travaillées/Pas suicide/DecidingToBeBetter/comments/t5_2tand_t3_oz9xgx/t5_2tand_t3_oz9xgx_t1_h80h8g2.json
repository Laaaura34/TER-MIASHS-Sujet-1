Been there myself. Your thoughts dart from \u201ceverything is fine \u201dto \u201cI\u2019m miserable af\u201d literally every other sentence. It\u2019s ok to accept you are not happy in life at the moment. The best advice I can give is to really think about what fundamentally is making you unhappy. I\u2019m sure it will be a mixture of things but the only way to get out of depression is to understand what is causing it, and to then address those problems. For me it was the jobs I was doing since graduating, took me 3 years to realise I hated every job and the entire industry and suddenly had the realisation of why am I doing this? I\u2019ve got a degree from a world leading university too, but I don\u2019t understand what that has got to do with your depression? Yer I have one too, but it didn\u2019t stop my depression. Only things in the absolute present really matter, particularly in regards to mental health/wellbeing. Forget your past and figure out who you are now and what you want.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz9xgx/how_did_you_overcome_burnout/h80h8g2/"}
