Like you said, writing a song has been your dream from teenage years. After all those years, you could have shifted. Or once you did it you don't feel it was as fulfilling as you imagined.

Maybe you can read some biographies and talk to people to hear their stories. A lot of people go through many job changes and do different things, so that's okay. Try to be in nature. Do something new and more physically engaging, like gardening, to be active, but give yourself a break.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz9xgx/how_did_you_overcome_burnout/h80b80x/"}
