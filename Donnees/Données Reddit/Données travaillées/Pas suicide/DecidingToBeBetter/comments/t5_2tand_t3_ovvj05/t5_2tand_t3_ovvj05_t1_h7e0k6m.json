I don\u2019t have a scientific evidence to back it up, but it did plant the seed of the idea that we are all kind of two identities combined into on, our right and left brains if you will, and at some point I started thinking and trying to catch these two parts interacting with one another; a very simple example is when you think of something funny and you laugh at it, or when you do some sort of self care and you appreciate it. You can be two sides of this internal relationship and suddenly you\u2019re never alone because you can always take care of you, and you can always be happy that you have yourself.\n\nI dunno; it\u2019s just a weird experience I\u2019ve had that\u2019s served me well. I also agree with the person talking about yoga.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovvj05/anyone_know_how_to_combat_loneliness_when_alone/h7e0k6m/"}
