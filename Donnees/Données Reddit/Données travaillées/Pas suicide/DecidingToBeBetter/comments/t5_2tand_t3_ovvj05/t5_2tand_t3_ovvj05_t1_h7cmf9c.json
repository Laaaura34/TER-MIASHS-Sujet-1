Yogis in the true vedic sense are masters of making friends with themselves. Many of us in the west are being forced to go through life alone since our communities have mostly been dismantled, naturally or by someone's design it doesn't matter. The Yogis, since almost the start of civilization, have learned to live alone for the sake of bettering their societies. This is the original role of a shaman. Meditation in any form you enjoy, digging into your own shadow. Learn who you are, warts and all. You don't have to like everything about yourself, no one truly does. But love yourself. Treat yourself like someone you love, treat others with respect. When you can be kind to others, it will reflect back on you and your kindness will reverberate into yourself. Do like fifty burpees a day and take some ten second cold showers. Tackle your life like an obstacle. Get the high score every day, and be proud of yourself for what you accomplish. Look into philosophy. When you have some free time, maybe at night if it helps you sleep, read books on philosophy and write a little. You'll learn about yourself as you dig and that's how you can stand the isolation. You're not alone if you're your own friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovvj05/anyone_know_how_to_combat_loneliness_when_alone/h7cmf9c/"}
