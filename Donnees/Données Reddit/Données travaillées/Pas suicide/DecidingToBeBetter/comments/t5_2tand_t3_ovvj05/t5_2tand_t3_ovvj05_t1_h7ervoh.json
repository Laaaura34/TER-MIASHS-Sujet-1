It comes from not \"knowing\" you. \n\nWhen we are around other people we connect with them and enjoy it and it is fulfilling. This also can't be done all the time and as you said it can be exhausting.\n\nI think that the time we have alone is meant to be time used to fulfill and satisfy ourselves, but that is obviously going to be hard to do if we aren't connected well to our sense of self and what we want. \n\nIf any of this resonated with you it may be a good place to start. If getting to know yourself seems tough I would say fear not, we can literally just trust out gut because deep down I think we always know what we want, even if it is deep down.\n\nI hope tgtihb", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovvj05/anyone_know_how_to_combat_loneliness_when_alone/h7ervoh/"}
