I backslide now and again, but I\u2019ve since moved out of the house. \nWhat has helped me is figuring out what I don\u2019t enjoy about my life (what bothers me, what needs fixing) and accepting full responsibility for it. Once I\u2019ve done that - which sometimes takes months (it\u2019s hard!) - I\u2019m able to make the changes necessary for shifting my life in a better direction.\nI read something recently that helped me make a tough decision: make choices based on who you want to be. So let\u2019s say you\u2019re tired and just want to chill and play video games, but you also have this image of yourself in the future as fit and healthy, then you need to decide in that moment what will get you to that vision - video games or going for a run/lifting weights/going outside/whatever?\nAnd you\u2019re right about life being short. My question for you is, in this fleeting existence we have, are you reaching your potential? Will you look back on your current decisions and actions and be proud of them?\nIf not, don\u2019t shame yourself, but perhaps study your habits, behaviors, and thoughts, and figure out what needs to change. It won\u2019t be easy. It means extinguishing comfortable habits that may be limiting you, and establishing new habits that can propel you toward the version of yourself you imagine possible.\nHope this helps. It\u2019s an ongoing process. Set small reachable concrete goals. The feeling of accomplishing a goal will motivate you to continue", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or0633/i_dont_know_how_to_mature/h6gbdg9/"}
