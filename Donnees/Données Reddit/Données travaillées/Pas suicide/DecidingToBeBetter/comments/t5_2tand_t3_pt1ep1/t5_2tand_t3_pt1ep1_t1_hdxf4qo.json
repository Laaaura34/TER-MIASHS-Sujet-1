Days are painful and dull so I relish my time in bed with my phone. Then I get carried away and stay up until the wee hours. That desire to be entertained and not let the day end is powerful, especially when the morning is nothing to look forward to. I dread the thought of turning off the phone to end up in darkness, silence and nothingness with only my own thoughts for company. Hell no. So my solution is podcasts or audiobooks. Then I can turn out the lights, get comfortable and close my eyes and STILL be entertained.  I set the sleep timer for an hour and can usually drift off to sleep without the stress of having to spend time alone with my own self.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hdxf4qo/"}
