I also have PTSD and find it super easy to zone out while scrolling on reddit or whatever. I have a hard time feeling joy as a result of the things that I went through. It becomes very easy to form habits around things that increase dopamine levels, like scrolling on a phone, food, porn, etc. \n\nFor me, it\u2019s not as simple as \u201cput the phone in the other room\u201d because I\u2019ll just replace this habit with something else. It\u2019s about getting to the deeper issue and working on that, building routines, finding hobbies, etc. It\u2019s not a quick fix though, especially when your mind is working against you and you\u2019re struggling to even get out of bed.\n\nIf /u/EbonyFaery had as much empathy as they say they do, they\u2019d be able to understand this. Just because your issues manifest in different ways, doesn\u2019t made OP\u2019s struggle any less valid. Instead they decided to mock OP, respond aggressively, and take a stance of superiority. It\u2019s off-putting, to say the least. You don\u2019t have to chime in anytime you don\u2019t relate to something, and you definitely don\u2019t have to be a dick about it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hduxm64/"}
