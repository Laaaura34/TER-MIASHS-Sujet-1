This usually includes doing my nightly skincare routine, sometimes doing a face mask or showering, making sure that my dog has eaten his dinner and eating dinner myself if I haven't yet, then I kind of look around and make sure that I've got everything. 1 hour before bedtime, I take my last couple meds, turn a narration on my Alexa thing and put my phone on do not disturb. After I lay down, I'll ask my dog if he wants to cuddle before bed. Sometimes he does and sometimes he doesn't. This is the time I take to really unwind my mind before bed. Sometimes I'll just lay there and do some breathing exercises. Once I start feeling quite tired, I go outside for my last smoke and tell Odin to go potty.

So, my best advice is to stay consistent", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hdttgra/"}
