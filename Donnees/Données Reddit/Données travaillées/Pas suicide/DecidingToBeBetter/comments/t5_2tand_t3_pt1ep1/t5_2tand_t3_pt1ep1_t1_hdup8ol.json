I absolutely encourage everyone to stick up for their view and contribute to a discussion. But that isn't what you were doing and you know it. This was in no way a \"healthy debate\" bro. All your comments were about calling people \"snowflakes\" and saying how pathetic they are. How do you consider that a healthy debate? \n\nHonestly, I personally agree that people largely need to focus more on personal discipline and finding their strength. But you were not contributing that point for a healthy debate. Even your response here to me \"Riiiiight\" a sarcastic condescension is not a healthy debate.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hdup8ol/"}
