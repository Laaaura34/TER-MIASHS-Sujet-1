It\u2019s not \u201ceasily\u201d combated, OP could be under a ton of stress, simply saying \u201cOP just go workout, eat great food, and get 10 hours a sleep, gosh, why aren\u2019t you taking my advice\u201d is kind of \u201crude\u201d(this is an example, obviously you didn\u2019t say this). There\u2019s a ton of factors that can be at play here, maybe OP has ADHD, where simply \u201cturning it off, have it in a different room\u201d isn\u2019t so easy. Dopamine is a powerful tool, and sadly most do not break away from an addiction until they have hit rock bottom, that point varies from person to person. Maybe you caught on the fact that your phone was addictive and took control before it was too late. When I was in deep depression I used videos/scrolling to escape from reality, this happened for years until I get better. I\u2019ve taken years to improve myself and I\u2019m still not out from its clutches. Yeah, I can turn my phone off, put it in another room, but my brain is conditioned for that dopamine, I try to improve bit by bit everyday, but it\u2019s a long process. You block every dopamine receptor in a rat and it won\u2019t move for anything and will eventually die, that\u2019s how strong dopamine is. From what I\u2019ve seen, OP doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s not taking advice either, and considering he posted on this forum asking for advice, I wouldn\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t want advice. I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re a therapist, you basically stated \u201cYour problem isn\u2019t a problem I have, therefore it\u2019s pointless, just use willpower dumbass.\u201d Maybe you\u2019ve posted some actual advice in other comments on here, but for this thread, you haven\u2019t contributed any useful information other than the fact you\u2019re way better than OP. You have to be a troll. You can always delete posts and stuff, and I\u2019m not dedicating my time to scroll through your entire comment history.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hduules/"}
