Also I do all my scrolling in a different room pre-bedtime then when I walk in the bedroom it goes right on the charger.  When I want to build a new habit I find downloading an app like Fabulous or Forest or a habit tracker (they even make fun RPG ones) or using a physical bullet journal to be helpful. I know it sounds counterintuitive to download a new app when trying to cut down on phone use, but the positive reinforcement from an app makes me feel like I've accomplished something and makes me want to keep doing it, and seeing a graph or crossing off a new day along with a motivational message keeps me wanting to continue. The bullet journal is nice for if you wanted phone use to be really reduced though and if you like doing art, and it's relaxing in itself to draw and write in it before bed. I even know a friend who uses a flip phone!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hduszhh/"}
