It\u2019s wrong. Especially if they\u2019re in a relationship, but even if they\u2019re not. They are taking advantage of their fans, and the groupies are also naive. Sorry. But you realised and showed you are stronger than your desires so good on you! \ud83d\udc4d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f2pij5/i_need_to_talk_myself_out_of_going_to_his_show/fhg62i1/"}
