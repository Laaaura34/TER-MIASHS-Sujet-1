I'm not talking about people in cities or in rural areas. I'm talking about OP. \n\nShe's taking a two-hour train ride and said she didn't have a place to stay. Ergo she needs a car. Full stop. She doesn't have one, and to me this lack of equipment illustrates a clear misunderstanding of how reality and priorities work. The question \"you don't have a car and...\" is rhetorical and illustrates to OP that just the question of transportation to this event should be a sign that she needs to stop what she's doing and look at herself in the mirror.\n\nHaving said that I also see my comment got down voted like 69 + times or something. This may be the type of sub where wanting to do better is all about like a pat on the back and saying yeah you're a great person, you're going to make it everything's going to be okay instead of wow dude you're way off you need to get your s*** together on a whole other level.\n\nIf this is that type of sub I'll leave.
