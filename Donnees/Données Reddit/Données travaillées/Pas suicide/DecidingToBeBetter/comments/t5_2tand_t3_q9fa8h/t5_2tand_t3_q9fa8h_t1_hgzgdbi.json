I would like to encourage you to ask yourself / think about how you know whether this relative is a \"light\" vs. \"more extreme\" case.  Like, what's your frame of reference?  Do you have other cases to compare this relative to? I am asking because I never felt  what I experienced was extreme. It took me almost 20 years to come to terms with the fact that a lot of things I got to witness weren't (even remotely!) normal. You know? That's why I would  suggest you use the grey rock method with anyone who causes you to be uncomfortable or gives you trouble. Mental health is super important, and if we don't stand up for ourselves, who will?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9fa8h/am_i_a_coward_for_avoiding_someone_who_repeatedly/hgzgdbi/"}
