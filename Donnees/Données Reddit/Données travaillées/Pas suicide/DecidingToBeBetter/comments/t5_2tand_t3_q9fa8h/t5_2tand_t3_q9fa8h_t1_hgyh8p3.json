It's my house, and no matter how important family and relatives are in our culture, some lines must not be crossed. \n\nThe only thing is that SHE is going no contact with me right now, she left the house for 3 days till now since I last confronted her,  not a single call or text, which made me feel extremely guilty and feeling like I was the reason why shes not returning. \n\nBut i have caught myself, shes used this with me before, talking behind my back, hurting me emotionally and then acting dumb and when she figures out I know something? She goes no contact until I reach out. \n\nBut not this time around, it ends here and I'm definitely re-setting my boundaries.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9fa8h/am_i_a_coward_for_avoiding_someone_who_repeatedly/hgyh8p3/"}
