Ive spent the time since focusing on myself and thinking hard about who I want to be and how to be a better person \n\nI was always in relationships even before that longer term one so this was a first but 3ish years later I\u2019m very happy I chose to stay single and learn more about myself. When I do end up in a relationship again I definitely think I\u2019ll be a better partner because of this break\n\nCOVID definitely made it easier since that was like 1.5 years of not being able to do much anyway but even in the last couple months starting to go out again I just look to enjoy myself and focus on my friendships. If someone special comes along I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll notice and if it works out then it works out. There shouldn\u2019t be any pressure to find love and it may be cliche but you can\u2019t love another until you love yourself (tbh still working on that last part but much further along than I was before)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qglwyz/how_to_decide_to_be_single/hi8ls67/"}
