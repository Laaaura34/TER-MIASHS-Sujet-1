I settled with 1 year (365 days). And according to my calendar, I am 270 days deep. Yay!\n\n\u2022 Community. I signed up for adult drawing classes where I get to be with same-aged people doing something relaxing. Take a yoga class and meet other people, join a book club, hang out with the current people in your life, put yourself out there!\n\n\u2022 Fall in love with yourself :) I did this by taking myself out on solo-dates and doing the things I love -- drawing and reading mostly\n\n\u2022 Accountability. Tell other people your goal to stay single for some time. Be open about your pitfalls. My main one was dating apps because it is very quick and easy to get validated on there. So I made sure to avoid those like the plague.\n\n\u2022 Introspection. Journaling to find out what you feel, who you are, what you want, what kind of partner you want. Everything. Engaging with emotions leads to greater self-awareness\n\n\u2022 Heal. This one is NOT glamorous, but it is very much worthwhile. I am in physical therapy right now, but counseling has been on my mind a lot, putting that one off for financial reasons. Healing doesn't only happen in counseling. It can also happen in introspection, communities, and time.\n\nBe kind to yourself \ud83d\udc9c it is okay to have lonely nights, as I had them (and still do too) but I feel better knowing that I am more self-sufficient emotionally and mentally than I was 270 days ago.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qglwyz/how_to_decide_to_be_single/hi9czfv/"}
