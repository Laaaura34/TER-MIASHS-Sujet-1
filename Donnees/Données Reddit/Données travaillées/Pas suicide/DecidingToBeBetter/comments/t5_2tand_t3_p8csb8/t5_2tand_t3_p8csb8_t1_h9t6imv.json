A man nervously approached me, holding a pair of work boots. He told me that he was starting a new job the next day and just bought the boots for the job but didn't have money for food.\n\nMy inner voice told me to give him some money, in a \u201dcast your bread upon the waters\u201d way. So I opened my wallet and I had a $20 bill, which I gave to him. He was surprised and appreciative.\n\nIf I had been told a lie, then he got rewarded for a good performance with props. But I think he told me the truth. I don't regret giving money to him or others.
