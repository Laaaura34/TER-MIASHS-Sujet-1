We do granola bars and water, hand sanitizer, travel tissues, masks, deodorant, bar soap, travel shampoo, tampons and pads, socks and underwear, a $20, and a lighter. I'm pretty sure we throw one or two more things in there too, but I can't remember them. Anyway, they're met with a mix of confusion and appreciation most of the time. We don't explicitly say what's inside, but whoever I give them to almost always smiles and looks just so excited like they've gotten a present. But yeah, the reality is every now and then, the recipient either won't care or assumes there's nothing they need or want inside and just take it and move on. We don't judge, we just hope it helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8csb8/20_seconds_at_a_stoplight_changed_me/h9syya2/"}
