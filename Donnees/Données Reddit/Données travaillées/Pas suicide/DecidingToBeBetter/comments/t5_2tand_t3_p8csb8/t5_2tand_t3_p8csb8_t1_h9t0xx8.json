I also from time to time carry disposable masks and other items when I\u2019m able to. I live in Seattle where we have a very large unhoused population and it\u2019s hard to see people suffering. \nI\u2019ve been on both sides of that situation- and while the food and things fill the immediate need, it also shows that someone cares, which is also important for people who are struggling.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8csb8/20_seconds_at_a_stoplight_changed_me/h9t0xx8/"}
