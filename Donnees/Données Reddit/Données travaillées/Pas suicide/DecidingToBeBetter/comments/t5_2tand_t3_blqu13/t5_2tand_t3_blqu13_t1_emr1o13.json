If you think you can trust your friends, I think you can be pretty sure your personnality doesn't bother them. If it really bothers you, should try to talk about it to one of your friends. In a real heart to heart talk, you know (talk about what you said in this thread and that it really bothers you). If they still say they aren't bothered by it, would you still want to change that part of your behavior?\n\nFor the calmness, I'd try meditation. I know to a lot of people it sounds like hippy stuff but I think it might be beneficial in your situtation. If done right, it can give you some of that calmness you're looking for.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/blqu13/how_to_be_more_calm_and_get_rid_of_my_neurotic/emr1o13/"}
