I too always felt the need to be the jokester and come up with witty comebacks. Often I \u201chijack\u201d a conversation and blatantly talk over the person telling a story, and incorporate my own thoughts/experiences.The thing is, you don\u2019t need to be in the spotlight to be interesting, you probably find your calm friend interesting and she isn\u2019t in the spotlight as you call it. \n\n\nAnother good way to test yourself is asking yourself \u201cam I listening to my friend so I can respond, or because I genuinely care about what they have to say\u201d. Half of the time I was already thinking of what I would say next -and inevitably reverting the attention to me- in my head while listening to my friends speak. I was listening to respond, not because I cared. \n\n\nLastly, don\u2019t be afraid to be yourself! It is okay to be loud and make lots of gestures and wanting to entertain your friends!
