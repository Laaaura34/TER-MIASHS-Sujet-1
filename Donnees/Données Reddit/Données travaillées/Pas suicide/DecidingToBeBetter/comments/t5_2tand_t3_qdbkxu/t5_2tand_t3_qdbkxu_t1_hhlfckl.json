I am so so so proud of you. Its hard leaving an abusive relationship. Im so glad you have good friends supporting you through it all. You only deserve good things in life and none of this was your fault. She abused you in all forms, physically, emotionally, gaslighting, manipulation\u2026 just everything. Im proud of you for deciding to get \u201cbetter\u201d from this trauma. Its really difficult to get out of that headspace and get depressed which is understandable, it can be part of the healing process. That parasite is gone, and she wont be feeding off of you for her own plan. She will probably try to contact you again in some sort of form even years later but you wont take that shit. My partners ex girlfriend even contacted him 5 years later who was the exact same! Would always threaten suicide if he broke up with her too. You got this. \nGood job being able to get out. Who knows what else she wouldve done to you years down the road..\n\nHopefully this cane out the right way, im using my phone so difficult to type!
