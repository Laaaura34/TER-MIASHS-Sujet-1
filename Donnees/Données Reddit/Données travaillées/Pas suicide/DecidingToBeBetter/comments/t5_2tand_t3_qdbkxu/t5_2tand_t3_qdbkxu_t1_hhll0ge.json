Yeah I'm glad I got out, there is so much more that I left out because my post was long even without them, like threats of suicide If I leave her and blackmailing to tell my family about me being agnostic and use of alcohol (they didnt know then) \n\nAs I said, sometimes I wish to talk to her but I keep one of her notes saying sorry, this all happened bcs I love you so much (the physical abuse apology note I mentioned) and remember how I felt to stop myself.\n\nRealizing my best friends were always there for me was the best thing happened since we broke up. I used to think that she was the only one who can support me but it was the opposite. My friends are there whenever I need and vice versa\n\nI was so scared to see her whenever I go out (we live in a small town) I was angry at myself bcs of this but I got over that problem too. I don't plan to see or talk to her again, ever. Even If I run into her I am sure I will be indifferent.\n\nAgain, thank you so much for your kind words.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdbkxu/about_leaving_an_abusive_relationship_and_what_my/hhll0ge/"}
