You could even make the jump and apply for internships and see if they\u2019ll give you a chance to learn on the job. You can usually leverage your past work experience (even if it seems unrelated) in interviews. Just practice interviewing. \n\nAlso I would say don\u2019t focus on learning a bunch of skills on the surface, but focus on learning things that genuinely interest you and get real deep.
