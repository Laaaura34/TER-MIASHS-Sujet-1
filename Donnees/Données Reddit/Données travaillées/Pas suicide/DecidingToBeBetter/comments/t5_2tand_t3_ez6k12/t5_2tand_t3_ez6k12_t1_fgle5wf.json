But it's okay to remove yourself from a situation that is only bringing you negativity. I get what you're saying about having to face the criticism because you will run into these types of situations a lot and would like to deal with them better, but engaging with a person who has no interest in having a conversation and acknowledging your point of view isn't worth it. Online is not reflective of the real world. Block them or simply ignore them, and move on.\n\nIf you MUST engage for whatever reason, kill them with kindness. Be mindful of what they're saying, really try to see things from their point of view regardless of how different it may be from yours. Even if it's criticizing you, just step outside of yourself for a second and see where they're coming from. Try to think of what might've happened in their life to make them think that, acknowledge their human-ness. We're all just misguided and scrambling around trying to find our way. If the conversation is going nowhere, just agree to disagree and then wish them well, sincerely", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ez6k12/a_fellow_redditor_is_calling_my_ideology_shit/fgle5wf/"}
