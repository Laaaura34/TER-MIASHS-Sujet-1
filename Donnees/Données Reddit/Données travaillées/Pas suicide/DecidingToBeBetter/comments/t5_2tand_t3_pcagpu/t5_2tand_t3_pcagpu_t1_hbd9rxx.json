I have the same problem, and \u201cout of sight out of mind\u201d is much easier said than done. I know you know you shouldn\u2019t be looking at socials, but sometimes the urge to look is too strong to ignore. My boyfriend and I both are like this, even tho he doesn\u2019t care about his exes and I don\u2019t care about mine. We\u2019re very open when we\u2019re feeling extra insecure due to the same reasons, but we both are very reassuring to one another as well. I know he would never cheat and I know I have nothing to worry about with his ex but she\u2019s always on my mind, I think she\u2019s so pretty it\u2019s almost as if I wish I were her friend or something. I\u2019m sending positive thoughts your way, just know youre not alone with this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcagpu/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_my_boyfriends_ex/hbd9rxx/"}
