I am a visual and analytical to a fault person, so whenever I catch myself on those dangerous thought rabbit holes, I picture an iron wood box that my grandpa made for me years ago. When I think of something that I need to talk about, but don\u2019t have the time at the moment, like trauma from my childhood or an ex or anything like that, I open the box in my minds eye, put the thoughts inside, close it and put it on a top shelf in the back of my mind. If it\u2019s something I don\u2019t need to think about, like someone being better than me, or prettier, or thoughts of worthlessness, I imagine a train coming to a stop in my mind and those thoughts getting off. I say nope, not your stop anymore, get back on and send the train on its way. \u2018Back on the train, out of my brain\u2019 helps.\n\nLike others have said here, it\u2019s fuckin work. Everyday. Practice mindfulness, aware of thoughts as they enter and then let them go. You got this :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcagpu/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_my_boyfriends_ex/haionaf/"}
