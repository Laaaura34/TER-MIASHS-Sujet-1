The biggest piece of advice that I can give you (rehab 3x detox 3x sober 3 1/2years finally!) is to be open to new ideas. Don\u2019t don\u2019t allow yourself to feel like the ideas you are shown are dumb. Be willing to do the hard work to make change which usually involves exploring the feelings that lead to addiction. Forgive yourself, love yourself and make sure that the voice that is in your head is loving and caring, like when you talk to your very best friend. I would love an update in a couple of months!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qawejg/going_to_rehab_tomorrow/hh636pr/"}
