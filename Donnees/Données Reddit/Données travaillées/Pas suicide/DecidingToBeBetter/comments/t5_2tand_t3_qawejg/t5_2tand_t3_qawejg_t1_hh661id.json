Take it serious and listen to what they have to say. Getting off of drugs isn't just stopping taking the drugs. I mean that helps, but it's mostly working on yourself once the physicals are over and dealing with the mental F&ckery. You have a reason to go to rehab. Find a reason to live sober, that way no excuse to use will matter. You got this if you want it. We make our own lives. We control our own emotions when things happen. Learn yourself and meditate, I think it's a must for recovery. You have to find yourself to be happy. Best of luck to you.
