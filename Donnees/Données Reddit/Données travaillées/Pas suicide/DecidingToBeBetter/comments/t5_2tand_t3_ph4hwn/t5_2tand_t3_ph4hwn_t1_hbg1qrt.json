I mean, keep the streak if it\u2019s fun! Maybe a game; food you cook, things that make you think of each other (\u201cI walked past this store and HAD to send this:\u201d) etc! If you only need one a day I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not hard. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThat said, it sounds like you wanna also make sure that real solid conversation is happening beyond that! That\u2019s tougher with less shared lives. In my experience with distance, short calls that are worked into the routine work best, like cooking breakfast or getting ready for bed. Long calls end up like system updates are aren\u2019t quite \u2018live\u2019 enough for a proper give and take. (Versus a quick morning call \u201cYou got this!\u201d and/or a quick evening call \u201chow\u2019d it go??\u201d These let you still be valid players in each other\u2019s lives. :) \n\nFinally, always have at least one visit planned and plan the next one during that one. Gives ya something to look forward to. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ph4hwn/want_to_end_snap_streaks/hbg1qrt/"}
