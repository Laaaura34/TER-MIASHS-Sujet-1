I know in the field of \"business intelligence\" that's what has become the flavor of the month in the past few years. I know \"R\" is also used for marketing research and analytics. If you want to change industry but still keep your knowledge and skills, that could be an industry where you could adapt yourself.\n\nI was looking at job for a health center I applied to (in public affairs), and there was a job for data scientist, I guess it would fit your profile. Have you looked into that type of job?\n\nYou are at an age where you should start to get a stable income with a \"real\" job. I was in the same situation as you, same age. I regret not having started to work earlier.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mptex0/29m_i_have_no_idea_what_i_should_be_doing_with_my/guc95by/"}
