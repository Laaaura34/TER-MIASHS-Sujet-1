You are correct. The reason I wanted to do a PhD is coz I like research, my plans were to ditch research after 10+ years and go into teaching and feels comfortable surrounded by the walls of a school. Very accurate on that part.\n\nWhen it comes to a job, I have done 3 years as business development exec (prior to my first masters) and 2 years in University administration (between the first and second masters) just to realize that I hate a desk based job. Which is why my biological field is animal movement and behaviour. \n\n>  You are at an age where you should start to get a stable income with a \"real\" job. I was in the same situation as you, same age. I regret not having started to work earlier. \n\nis what scares me. I know societal norms are just a trash, but I got two parents who I need to take care of. I am already with what I can every month, but that might not be enough as they are getting old now.
