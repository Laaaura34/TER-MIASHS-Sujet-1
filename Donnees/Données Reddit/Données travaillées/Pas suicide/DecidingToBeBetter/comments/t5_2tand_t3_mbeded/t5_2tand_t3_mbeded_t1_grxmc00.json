When I feel super stressed and all my emotions are maxed out, I try to remove myself from the situation if there is one and go into a quiet personal place (my room or the bathroom) and I open up either my notes app or my notebook and just let loose honestly. If I\u2019m angry I write like I am venting, if I\u2019m anxious i write down what is making me anxious and what i think is causing it. Doesn\u2019t matter just get all the feelings out on the notes. After i get out all the overwhelming thoughts i feel a noticeable shift.  It really is helpful even if it feels hard or kind of silly to write out your feelings. Another plus of writing out the feelings is being able to look back at a time where you are calmer and can rationalize to find a solution to the thing that is causing all this stress for you! Whatever the case may be, I hope you find some way that works for you and also I hope your stressful situation is over soon.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mbeded/i_need_ways_to_calm_myself_down_that_dont_revolve/grxmc00/"}
