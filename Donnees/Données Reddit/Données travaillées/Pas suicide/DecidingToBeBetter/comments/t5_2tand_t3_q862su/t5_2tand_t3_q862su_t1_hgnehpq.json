The ones that flat out have told me they don\u2019t have friends outside work (and they don\u2019t there either) are Q guys who deny the Holocaust. \nOf the nerds at work that I like and get along with, most are family oriented and are not going to do any thing social outside of work. \nThat\u2019s pretty much where I\u2019m at re: OP\u2019s problems. \n\nI\u2019m very social and I already had friends, hobbies. I don\u2019t negative self-talk or have low self-esteem, but my problem is I basically meet zero women outside dating apps because I don\u2019t have any hobbies women like (and I\u2019ve tried a million new ones), and obviously no women at work to become friends with.\n\nI agree with you btw, all good advice.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q862su/how_to_let_go_of_regret/hgnehpq/"}
