I just don\u2019t share enough interests with women.\n\nMy interests: martial arts, watching MMA, crypto, guitar, reading, video games, history, psychology, self-help, hiking, camping, exercise, cooking and a lot of other stuff (I\u2019m being too quick typing this out to recall).\n\nI tried: Yoga (I\u2019m already very flexible from martial arts, and I like yoga,so this was a no-brainer), a few cooking classes, wine & painting nights.\n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t have any of OP\u2019s baggage, I worked on myself for a very long time. I\u2019m a very confident person, I have zero problem approaching anyone and befriending them, and not to be *too cynical* I\u2019m definitely attractive to most women (6ft1, white, mostly athletic, blue eyes, dark hair) - I absolutely cannot meet women interested in a relationship. If I have some drinks on a night out, I have no difficulty meeting someone for the night, but nothing serious.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q862su/how_to_let_go_of_regret/hgppum0/"}
