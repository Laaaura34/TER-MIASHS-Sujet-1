You're human, you make mistakes. Learn from them.\n\nHating yourself now because of what you have done before is just a waste of time. Focus on what you should do next, and work towards it. It's cliche, but for good reason: you can't change the past. \n\nBelieving you know what other people's entire lives are like based on seeing one small part is called imagination. Just because people are able to do what you want to do a little earlier does not mean their entire lives are \"normal,\" whatever that means. If what they have is something you think you need in your life, go for it. Envying others won't get you there any quicker.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q862su/how_to_let_go_of_regret/hgpde65/"}
