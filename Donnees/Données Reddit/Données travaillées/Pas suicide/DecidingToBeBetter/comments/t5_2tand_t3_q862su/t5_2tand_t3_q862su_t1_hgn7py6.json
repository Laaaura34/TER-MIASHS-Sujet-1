You sound like you have a pretty good life already and lots of potential ahead of you.\n\nI would focus on controlling your envy and jealousy issues. Go to therapy or continue to go to therapy if you're already doing that.

I hope you feel better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q862su/how_to_let_go_of_regret/hgn7py6/"}
