Now, I have been in the same boat as you, seeking the \"why\" behind everything, and to be frank what I learned is that this mythical \"chemistry\" is really just a spirit of play.  \n\nWas there a time where you enjoyed playing, with no goal in mind?  Have you shared this with anyone?  There's nothing new under the sun, and really that same joyful collaboration that binds children is what also attracts other adults.  \n\nSo, I say this not to be critical, but your first step may be turning off this pursuit of some grand reason \"why\" you cannot build this mythical idea of \"chemistry.\"  What you are seeking can only be found by doing, and not thinking, and this absence of thinking means you also have to turn off the part of you that seeks a purpose in any playful activity.  So, for example, you might have a snowball fight with someone, but the \"chemistry\" you seek involves living in the moment and not worrying about keeping score or impressing the other person.  It is building fun, and inviting others to share in your fun, and then not giving a crap if they choose not to do so.  \n\nThe same goes for writing.  The \"chemistry\" is with the character on the page.  It is writing for an audience of one - you - and then sharing that joy.  It is this joy of creation which is shared with other writers and binds you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fcbam6/my_life_will_not_advance_until_i_have_a_mastery/fja30al/"}
