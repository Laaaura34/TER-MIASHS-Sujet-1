I just had to remind myself that they don\u2019t promote for no reason in the military. If I am in charge it is because I was damn good at my job. So when a new guy came in, even older than me, I would just remember that and be a teacher and lead by example. Military bearing is important! And it\u2019s the reason the military works the way it does. I say be proud that you are good at what you do and your chain of command sees that. Anyone who isn\u2019t respecting the chain of command and is lacking in bearing to the point they won\u2019t listen to you because of your age is a person who would pull that crap no matter who was in charge.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8gh6e/is_this_imposter_syndrome/hgp9jp9/"}
