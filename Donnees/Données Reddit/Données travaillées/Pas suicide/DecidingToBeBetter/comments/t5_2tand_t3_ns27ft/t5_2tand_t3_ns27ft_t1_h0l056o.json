Living in another country is the \\*perfect\\* opportunity in order to learn the language there. You can always start another language later, but you kinda have a \"golden opportunity\" with dutch right now.\n\nHowever, if you're really set on studying french, then my advice is to integrate the language in your day to day life once you've gotten into an \"intermediate\" level.\n\nThe beginning is always the hardest, so typically, a language school or something can really boost your level up, especially during the early phases. Once you get the hang of it is when you can apply my advice. Some examples would be to watch series that you already know, but switch the language in french and put subtitles, in english at first, but once you become more adept, then you can watch the same show again, in french audio AND french subtitle (but this would be when you're a bit better at the language imo).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns27ft/im_gonna_learn_a_new_language_give_me_some_advice/h0l056o/"}
