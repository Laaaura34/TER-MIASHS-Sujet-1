Since you'll be learning purely for the sake of utility (whereas for me it's more a matter of linguistic mechanics and exchanges, as well as utility), you have a lot more room for error. So as you're studying the language (and I do recommend that you pick Dutch over French in this situation, at least for now) don't focus as much on perfecting your grammar and all that, just focus more on learning how to express yourself and understand others. This will naturally become easier once you're in the country and practicing the language with native speakers (this type of immersion is one of the best ways to learn a language, and is the reason that most foreign  language degrees--at least where I live--require some time studying abroad).\n\nI've found language learning resources for obscure languages like Mayan and Nahuatl.
