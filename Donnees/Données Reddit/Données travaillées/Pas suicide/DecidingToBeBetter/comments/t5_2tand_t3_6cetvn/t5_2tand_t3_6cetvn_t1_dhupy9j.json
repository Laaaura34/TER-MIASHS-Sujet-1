A necessary survival skill that can become a serious problem.  It can be described as being \"trapped within one's mind\" or \"that reality is unreal\", unawareness of what is happening around one, or a sensation that things happening are happening to someone else.\n\nThe opposite of that is connecting the mind with the body to fully experience the world around oneself.  Paying attention to the moment, connecting to what is happening, is integrating oneself fully.
