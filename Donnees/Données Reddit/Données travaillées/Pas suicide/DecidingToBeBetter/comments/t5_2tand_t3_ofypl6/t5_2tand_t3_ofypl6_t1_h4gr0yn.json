I do software engineering for my 9-5 and dabble in writing and start up stuff on the side. Let me tell you it's WAAAAY easier and less stressful for me to experiment than some of my friends because engineering is a very solid and reliable \"home base.\" It's very romantic to chase a dream and live dollar to dollar making it happen but for most people I think that's too stressful. You have plenty of time to evolve into the perfect fit and starting with something you're good at and provides job security will help you enjoy life more along the way.\n\nSo yeah. No pressure to find the perfect fit on job #1. Most people don't, and for most people their dream job changes over the course of their life. That's totally fine and you seem like a well rounded person who can adapt as needed and as your priorities inevitably shift over time. Try your best to enjoy it, you only get to live each day once and most mistakes are more reversible than we realize :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofypl6/i_want_to_learn_to_be_happy/h4gr0yn/"}
