Obviously don't be irresponsible, but I'd say pick the path you think you'll enjoy the most. Most people find their passions through keeping an open mind and trying new things as they go. It's a hard thing to look for but keeping your options open and experimenting is the fastest way. There's a lot you can't predict. Like, at the surface my current position isn't very glamorous, but the freedom + flexibility + people make it perfect for me and gives me all the space I need to enjoy other things too. I wouldn't have aimed for this out of college but I stumbled onto it because I kept an open mind.\n\nAlso most joy/fulfillment/excitement also comes from outside your career. Rich relationships, psychologically healthy self care habits, gratitude, and good health are usually much more important than what you do for a living. Plus you can work on all of those while doing experiments for your passion and that way there's less pressure on any one part of your life. You're working hard and seem very dedicated, I'm sure it will come with time. Just make sure you enjoy the process!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofypl6/i_want_to_learn_to_be_happy/h4j8zm4/"}
