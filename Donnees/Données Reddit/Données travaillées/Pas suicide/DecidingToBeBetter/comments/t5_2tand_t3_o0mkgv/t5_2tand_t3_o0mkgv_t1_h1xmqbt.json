Don't beat yourself up, it causes brain damage, lol. \n\nStress is a big dumb influence, too, more brain damage. Guess what some of life's top stressors are? Breaking up. Moving. Changing jobs.

Develop double-checking protocols. Write cheat sheets.\n\nI recently heard that our brains aren't great at comprehending negative qualifiers.
