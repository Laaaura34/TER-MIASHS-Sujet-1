I just last week started using Reddit and I love how I can mostly control what I can and can\u2019t see on here by joining certain communities such as this one that will be uplifting to myself and others. The time I spend on social media has literally been cut in half or more and it feels so freeing. I\u2019ve learned ignorance is bliss and not seeing so much political bullshit and peoples opinions constantly and etc even has my anxiety and depression feeling better. I\u2019m not constantly comparing myself to others and seeing all the crap that always had me feeling that way. If it\u2019s working for you, keep it up! I had to hop on a week ago or so because I had a couple people reach out to me to see if I was still alive because of the lack of interaction on social media. I never felt the need to announce my departure from social media, I just kind of ghosted social media all at once. So I hopped on to say I was still alive, but didn\u2019t feel the need to mentally be on social media anymore and if they needed to reach me, they would find a way. I\u2019ve learned... people don\u2019t really care about me as a person, only if it benefits them. They just care about inserting themself in my business and aren\u2019t true friends. Sorry- that was a lot- but felt good to blurt it all out and relate lol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kzl8zq/i_permanently_deleted_my_snapchat_twitter_account/gjqakyy/"}
