It took me a long time to do this. Into my 30s in fact and I wish I ditched them way younger. Putting up with that will erode your confidence like nothing else. \n\nI lots a bunch of weight and got fairly fit and healthy, and quit alcohol and drugs a while ago now. All stuff I wish I did in my 20s. My number one tip with all of this is focus on consistency as opposed to results. This is because consistency / time = results! \n\nDon't aim to run 6 days and only do 4 and then quit because it wasn't perfect. Running once a week is good! Keep doing it, even if you mess up. \n\nGood luck. I believe in you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kzl8zq/i_permanently_deleted_my_snapchat_twitter_account/gjpgkbm/"}
