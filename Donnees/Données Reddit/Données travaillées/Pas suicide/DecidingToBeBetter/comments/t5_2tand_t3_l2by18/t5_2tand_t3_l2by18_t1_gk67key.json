I'm slowing down on my use, from being someone that smoked all day everyday, to now I just smoke in the morning for my anxiety, at lunch for my appetite, and in the evening to relax and put myself to sleep. It's all about moderation, not by placing these restrictions on yourself. I support your decision to quit, but I think you should be more focused on just getting better, and not looking for an easy way out (drugs). What helped me slow down is that I started using the Headspace app to try learning how to meditate, and that alone was enough to substitute my use for tackling my daily anxiety. Add good habits to your routine and take bad ones out, little by little. It takes time and I'm still early on my road to getting better overall, but learning self-control/moderation is crucial", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l2by18/threw_out_my_weed_scheduled_a_psych_appointment/gk67key/"}
