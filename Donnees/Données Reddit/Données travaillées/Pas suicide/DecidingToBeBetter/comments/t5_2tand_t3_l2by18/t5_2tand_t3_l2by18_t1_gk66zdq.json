Just to be clear, I'm not seeking new meds. I have prescriptions for depression and anxiety (which I keep up with) but they just don't get the job done like pot did. I'm hoping that once I level out on my withdrawal from weed my doc can talk about whether I should really be on those, it changing to something else. Honestly, getting my psych meds right and knowing exactly what they're doing to me is a huge reason I'm quitting weed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l2by18/threw_out_my_weed_scheduled_a_psych_appointment/gk66zdq/"}
