That's how it feels similar to the bandaid sentiment, to me. Now I seem to have a much better relationship with it, and actually get high instead of uncomfortable. It's like you have to experience reality in an independent way first, and *then* bring in the weed to enjoy the more expanded, uplifted version of reality. I think of it as \"loading up,\" the brief (hold off for an hour or two, a day, a week) or even lengthy (weeks, months, although I havent done that yet) abstinence. \n\nIt's like I was so fixated on getting high to be happy that I no longer had a rich enough or comfortable enough mental life to properly enjoy the high.\n\n\nAnd then there's the simple way to put it, that for most people weed is like a happiness button, and you can just naturally neglect your innate ability to be happy if you go for that button too often.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l2by18/threw_out_my_weed_scheduled_a_psych_appointment/gmoo4bg/"}
