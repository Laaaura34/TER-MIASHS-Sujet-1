It's just not true. If you're struggling with going cold turkey, I highly recommend smoking CBD or using other CBD products. CBD gives you some of the feel good effects of THC without being high or foggy. As others have suggested, the R/Petioles community is a good resource for civil conversations about weed usage. Good luck, I wish you the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l2by18/threw_out_my_weed_scheduled_a_psych_appointment/gk5xhje/"}
