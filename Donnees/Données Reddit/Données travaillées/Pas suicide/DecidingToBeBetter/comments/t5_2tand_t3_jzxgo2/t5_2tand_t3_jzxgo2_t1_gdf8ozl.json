But I realise it\u2019s so stupid  having that content in your feed slowly polluting the mind any time I go on reddit. Scroll, scroll, scroll and \u2018I abuse my partner daily, am I the arsehole?\u2019. The best ones to get rid of are relationship and gender related subs.  Now I have a feed full of hobbies.\n\nNot that it\u2019s better seeking out toxic/gossipy content to try feel better or when bored, in some ways, that\u2019s probably worse. But it\u2019s so easy just to unsub as a first step and allow something more neutral or positive to have a chance at taking my interest first.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jzxgo2/i_left_28_subreddits/gdf8ozl/"}
