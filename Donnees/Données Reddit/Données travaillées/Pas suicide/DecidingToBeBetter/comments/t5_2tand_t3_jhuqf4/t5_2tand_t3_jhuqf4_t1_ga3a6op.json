I\u2019m a bit nervous because my boyfriends family are quite the party people and love to drink. But I\u2019ve woken up feeling sick more than I\u2019d like, and I feel horrible because my boyfriend has to babysit me when I\u2019m sloppy drunk. It leaves him tired because he has to take care of me, and I\u2019ve had it. I\u2019ll have a drink or two at celebrations and Christmas, but I\u2019m done drinking for no reason and definitely done being drunk. The first couple of hours of being drunk are fun, but then it\u2019s over and I\u2019m left with more cons than pros. I quit smoking weed cold turkey after smoking daily, and I\u2019m committed to stopping drinking cold turkey. I don\u2019t drink daily, but it\u2019s the binge drinking when I do drink that really bothers me. Carbonated water from now on it is! I\u2019m excited to start this new phase in my life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/ga3a6op/"}
