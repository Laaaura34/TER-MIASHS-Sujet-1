Kudos to you.  There are many folks out there who wish they had figured it out at 21.\n\nThis website [https://www.soberrecovery.com/forums/](https://www.soberrecovery.com/forums/).  is a good place for people looking to get sober.  It may or may not be your thing but is worth a look.\n\nI quit drinking 2 years ago after my first blackout.  It is scary.  I have depression and knew drinking wasn't a good idea but I so enjoyed it.  My two glasses of wine was turning into 3 and then 4.  Quitting didn't really change my life much but I'm pretty sure it changed my future.\n\nKeep thinking and learning.
