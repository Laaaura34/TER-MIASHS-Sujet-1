I allwaaayyss wake up at like 4am and start doing random stuff and be loud, and wake my bf up. I felt so so bad because this has happened so many times, and apologizing to my bf has lost its meaning to me. Why say sorry if I\u2019m gonna keep doing it? I\u2019m gonna not ever do it again, hopefully never again", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/ga3v414/"}
