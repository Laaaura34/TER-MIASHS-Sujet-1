If I want something \"interesting\" it's a bit of sparkling water with a slice of lime or lemon squeezed in it.\n\nSo what, right?\n\nThe point being: I have never missed it.\n\nI worked in the bar industry for a good five years in my 20's and I've watched the \"drinkers\" do their thing on a nightly basis.  It's not pretty.\n\nSo if you don't want to drink...just don't.  If people force you, if friends force you, beg you to drink, they're not much of a friend.\n\nBut good choice!
