Without fail my sleep is messed up every Monday and Tuesday after drinking at the weekend.\n\nIf I've been on holiday or for whatever reason drinking regularly for a week or more it can literally take me weeks to get back on track and sort my sleep out, it's horrible and I should know better by now.\n\nThough personally even when stopping drinking for 30-45 days a time I haven't noticed any incredible changes in my sleeping pattern or energy like so many people report but I suspect that would be the case for daily drinkers (I'm more like 3 to 4 days per week of drinking usually in a row).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/ga77czr/"}
