Such a great book! It really shaped how I view alcohol and I attribute it to my success in staying sober/in control.\n\nIf you do drink again after a period of being sober, be careful! It\u2019s really hard to moderate for some people, especially early on. I\u2019ve learned how to moderate really well but it took me some time.\n\nPeople can judge if they want but you gotta do what\u2019s best for you. If you lose friends over alcohol they weren\u2019t true friends. You can still have a fun night without alcohol! I actually enjoyed drinking alcohol free beer at parties because then I felt like I was drinking something but without the hangover. \n\nMy life is 10000% better not drinking regularly. My evenings and mornings are filled with enjoyable activities now, and I have way more energy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/ga3bxer/"}
