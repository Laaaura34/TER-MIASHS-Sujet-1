And totally inspired by your journey, because even though you didn\u2019t know what was on the other side of your pain, and it hurt like hell but ya kept on going.  I\u2019m into the 4th month of a horrible breakup (a betrayal of epic proportions), and the pain is still very present but it\u2019s not as frequent.
