Some breakups can scar you emotionally, but that\u2019s part of healing. I\u2019ve had two exes and one of them is one of my best friends now. We didn\u2019t work as a couple but we can still count on each other when it matters. The other guy could fall off the map and he\u2019d be doing the world a favor: racist, homophobic, misogynistic, abusive towards animals, just a model citizen in opposite land. I don\u2019t hate him by any means but now that I am free to come and go as I please without his insidious presence looming over me, I realize how much happier I am without this nasty reptile in my life.\nAnyway, it sounds like you\u2019ve made peace with this person having been a part of your life at one point, and I hope you remember how much better you feel without them if/when they decide to come back for Part Deux (they always do).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpfqht/im_ready_to_say_my_breakup_was_the_best_thing/godcka8/"}
