I broke up with mine because he caused me a lot of emotional pain and instability and he had no lasting incentive to change as long as I stayed around. \n\nI\u2019ve never felt betrayed by someone close to me so that\u2019s been hard for me to work through. But I am proud of how much I\u2019ve grown from it so far. I know this takes time so I am being patient. Your post helps me remain optimistic that one day I\u2019ll view this painful moment as the best thing that could\u2019ve happened to me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpfqht/im_ready_to_say_my_breakup_was_the_best_thing/gocrexn/"}
