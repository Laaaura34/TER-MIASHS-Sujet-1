Sometimes, the wounds are too deep and they won't close unless we focus entirely on it and get away from those that keep reopening it.\n\nI feel you still have the hope of getting together with her, although it seems it's not possible anymore, and I think that's what holding you back from moving on, you know?\n\nIt will hurt like hell to block all contact and stay away from her, but sometimes going through pain now may result in not having pain in the long run, and I think that's the way to go.\n\nTake your time, but I strongly advice to focus on yourself, on your life, and all the new perspectives you can have in the future.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpfqht/im_ready_to_say_my_breakup_was_the_best_thing/goehhbo/"}
