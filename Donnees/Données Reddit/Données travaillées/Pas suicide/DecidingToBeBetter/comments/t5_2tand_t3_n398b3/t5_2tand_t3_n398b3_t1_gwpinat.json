There are actually communities that aren't like you discribe them. \n\nI never was religious myself, but found a community that was just not what I've expected. I can totally be myself and got a lot of support when I really needed it without them expecting something in return. Two years ago I would never expected me to say something like that, but it can be really healing to go to church. \n\nSince then I actually don't feel as alone as I used to. Being an unmarried mother, I never got an unwelcoming remark by anyone there. I was welcomed with open arms and have the feeling of coming home every Sunday.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n398b3/went_to_church_for_the_first_time_in_many_years/gwpinat/"}
