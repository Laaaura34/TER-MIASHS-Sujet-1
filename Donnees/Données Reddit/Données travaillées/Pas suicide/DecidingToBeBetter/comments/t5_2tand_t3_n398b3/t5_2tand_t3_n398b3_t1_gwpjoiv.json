Not to mention the focus on dogma and scriptural interpretation that often ironically detracted from learning how to be kind and develop true care for yourself, your family, friends, community, etc. \n\n\nIt took years from leaving that to where I am now. I feel more apt now to find that empathy and understanding through reading, meditating, other meditative hobbies (gardening and wood carving), exercising, listening to podcasts to learn from other's lives and experiences, etc.. Hopefully now that I'm vaccinated and, fingers crossed, when covid starts going away, that will also include more volunteering and community building activities as well. I understand everyone's different, though, and if religion helps you find that and gets you to that same place, that's awesome!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n398b3/went_to_church_for_the_first_time_in_many_years/gwpjoiv/"}
