You'll never feel exactly the same way again. \n\nBut you'll have other good moments, different but good. \n\nAnd maybe giving into ones vice makes you feel a little bit good, or it lets you remember what it felt like to feel good in the moment in the past\n\nBut you can't go back, and you have to make today and tomorrow good too\n\nIt's \"chasing the high\", but I feel like that term makes people think it's \"trying to get as high as you felt the first time you used\" But really that high was actually about a good moment in life before you took that first hit or line or gave into that \"I know I shouldn't, but I'll do it anyway\" feeling", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/prvurc/how_unprocessed_experiences_lead_to_addiction/hdli6lq/"}
