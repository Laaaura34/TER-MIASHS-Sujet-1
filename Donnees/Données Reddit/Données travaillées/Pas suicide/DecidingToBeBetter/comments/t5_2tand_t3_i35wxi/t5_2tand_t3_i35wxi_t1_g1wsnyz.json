Honestly, I wasn't even expecting a reply, nor did I remember that it was my cake day.\n\nHmm that's interesting. I guess to me, it seems like most people appear to-- for lack of a better term-- \"have their shit together,\" but in reality it's most likely that they are either not aware of their trauma or don't want to admit it. I suppose I should take comfort in knowing that *I'm* not the abnormal one.\n\nWhat's also surprising is that my therapist doesn't believe that I'm exhibiting any real unhealthy behavior (I could be paraphrasing incorrectly). She believes that it's in my nature to be genuinely kind and selfless, and not doing anything for the sake of the reward in the form of gratitude. I don't know though, it feels like a gray area. It's true that I'm nice because it's the nice thing to do, but I can't deny that gratitude is addicting. Do I *need* approval from others? Maybe not, but it feels really good.\n\nI certainly understand that \"I can't live without you\" is unhealthy. To me, being in a (good) relationship just makes me happier overall. Like having a good friend, but even more because we get physical and intimate satisfaction.\n\nI don't think I can explain myself well enough without making a wall of text, but I think I get the idea, and I'll slowly go through the resources you graciously provided. I already do feel a little better as an independent individual.\n\nThanks again!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i35wxi/i_want_to_stop_being_codependent/g1wsnyz/"}
