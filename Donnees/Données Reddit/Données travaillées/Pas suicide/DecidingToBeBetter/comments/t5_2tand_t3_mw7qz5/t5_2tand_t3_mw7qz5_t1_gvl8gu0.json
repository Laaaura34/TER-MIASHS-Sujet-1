What I've learned from the 3rd point is, that it can be applied not only to prevent amd lose bad habits(in my case cravings for food) but also to obtain new habits. I set my goals, I reach them and I set new goals. \n\nThe goals just need to be set to that which will make you ultimately happy. In my case I am not so happy with my body.
