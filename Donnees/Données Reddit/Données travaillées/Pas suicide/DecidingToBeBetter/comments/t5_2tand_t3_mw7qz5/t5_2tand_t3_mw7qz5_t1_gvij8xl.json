This might sound a bit crazy but this might've just saved me. I legit want to cry right now. I have OCD and keep having thoughts worrying about doing things that might ruin my life just to fulfill a desire.  For instance breaking up with my fiance just because he's not my \"perfect\" or \"ideal\" person despite us being so great and happy together. It's been torturing me for months. This might sound weird to an outsider but anyone with ROCD or just OCD in general will understand what I mean.
