Actually this was an idea that I had planned on working on, to achieve a perfect split. But then whenever my period came, I stopped practicing and didn't continue :/ guess I need to use this post as motivation and continue where I left off haha.

Thanks for the tip! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jo95vk/new_skill_november/gb8f90q/"}
