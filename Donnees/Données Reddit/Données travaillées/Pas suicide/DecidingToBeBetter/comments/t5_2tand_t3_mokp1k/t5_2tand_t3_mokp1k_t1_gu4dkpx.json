Group workout, charity work, take a class on something.   Go somewhere where people have a purpose and look for companionship first.  Don\u2019t worry about the physical- like, at all.  Put it out of your mind.  Just make friends in a setting that\u2019s conducive to shared interest, and everything, in time, will work itself out.  That time may be long, but if you\u2019re there for the right reasons doing the right things it will work out.  Don\u2019t focus on dating and physical stuff or you\u2019re gonna come off badly.  Make girl friends, and enjoy the friendship for what it is.  If it\u2019s meant to be more it will move that way.  \n\nAlso, no shame AT ALL in internet dating.  Zero.  It\u2019s meant for people- all single people.  Don\u2019t focus on the \u201cgoal\u201d, just be the best date you can be- look your best, practice confidence, and tell your best stories and jokes.  And when you flop, you\u2019ll go to bed knowing a little more about what dating should be.\n\nTake care of yourself too.  Healthy, well groomed look is important, you don\u2019t have to be the rock, just be the best version of you that you can be.  \n\nGood luck.  My cousin was in much the same boat, he\u2019s now happily married, it does tend to work out.  Live a healthy active lifestyle, make a lot of new friends, and you will 100% solve your loneliness issue- even if you\u2019re a bachelor forever.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mokp1k/ugly_on_the_outside_and_slowly_turning_ugly_on/gu4dkpx/"}
