Even if you find someone who genuinely likes you, you may not even believe them, or worse, you may think they\u2019re wrong to like you and drive them away.\n\nSo true. Just had this happen to me. Was seeing a woman that was super into me but I frankly don\u2019t like the man in the mirror and couldn\u2019t fully accept that she was into me. I would have this voice inside my head telling me that she was either using me or desperate. No matter how much I tried convincing myself that she was genuinely into me I couldn\u2019t silence the voice. We called it quits because I realised that I need to learn to love myself and be comfortable being on my own before I try to rope someone into my life. \n\nAll this is to say that if anyone doesn\u2019t love themselves they should work on that before they look for love elsewhere.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mokp1k/ugly_on_the_outside_and_slowly_turning_ugly_on/gu524eg/"}
