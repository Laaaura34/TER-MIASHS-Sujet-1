Most of us have started to journal on our electronic devices, however, if you feel that this doesn\u2019t work for you, I\u2019d encourage you to keep a notebook or diary specific to this purpose. You could even get something small and portable that you can carry around. I\u2019d say manually writing something could also be more beneficial as you can bring out your creative side with it, by doodling and illustrating it. As to your question about addressing your anxious thoughts and triggers, the first step is to identify your trigger. Once you identify it, write about it in your journal, manually. Try understanding why that particular thing is triggering for you, and illustrate it however you\u2019d like in your journal. To deal with your dip in confidence, I\u2019d recommend trying daily positive affirmations. If you continue to find yourself struggling with this, you could try addressing these issues with your therapist. Keep working on yourself, and take care!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o11689/is_there_a_methodworksheet_similar_to_journaling/h2vo5kh/"}
