I believe i have Audible finally figured out, so i think i might start trying to finish these books in these breaks.  I really like the journal idea. I have not really found a good way to do it, but I think you have given me the inspiration to actually start this.  I really want to pass on a handwritten journal, but i think if were to start digitally writing entries, then hand write, i may have better success.  i like the idea about saving articles.  often times, since i don't have time, i just \"read headlines\" which is the worst way to consume information.  I think i'll dig around for a good way to do this, so i can read more later.  I have heard great things about the podcast 'Start Up' i listen to podcasts on my commute, and i think i need to expand my horizons.  \n\nThank you for the feedback.  this is quite helpful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/75yj63/finding_ways_to_optimize_idle_time_and_take/doevc1a/"}
