They use a lot of ingredients that I'm already familiar with and I decided that was the best fit. I'm finding their calls for seasoning are a bit light for my taste, I'm one of those people who needs to be punched in the face with flavor, so I'm not so crazy about \"subtle hints\" of this or that in food. I've got a few of my own creations from a few years back as well. I used to be vegetarian and made a few recipes that could be vegan as well. Broccoli tacos being my personal favorite. I can share if you don't require much instruction. I'm not good at nailing down amounts since I do most of it by eye.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dc9a4i/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_and_im_proud_of_myself/f2bxco3/"}
