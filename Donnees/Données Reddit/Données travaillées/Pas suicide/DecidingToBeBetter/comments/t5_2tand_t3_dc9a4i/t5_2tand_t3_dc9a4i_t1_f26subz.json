You got this. I need to join you in this. I have been sober from mary jane for 7 months now. I am still trying to stop cigarettes. I can say instead of a pack a day, a pack can last me 2-2.5 days now. I have gained 30 lbs in these 7 months though and it's depressing so maybe it is time for a little vegan cleanse.

It never fully heals but you learn to cope with it, ignore the anxiety, give yourself pep talks, etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dc9a4i/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_and_im_proud_of_myself/f26subz/"}
