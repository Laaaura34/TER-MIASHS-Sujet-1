I definitely need to quit as well, and one of the previous posts I've read on /r/DecidingToBeBetter motivated me to do it this month. Don't have the exact date yet, but I will definitely do it in October. \n\nI've been smoking A LOT for 14 years and I've tried to quit once for 10 days (I was drinking some pills to help with that) and I was pretty surprised that I didn't feel any cravings. The problem was I got pretty depressed and apathetic, to the point that things I enjoy, doesn't make sense without cigarettes (Good meal - pointless without a cigarette after, Sex - pointless without a cigarette after) and the thing that was messing my mind the most was the fact that it's final - I can NEVER smoke again.  So I;ve just decided to start smoking again and that was it (This depression started to fck with my good habits and routines, so I needed to do something about it, and I didn't know how long will it last).\n\nWanting to quit ever since, and wondering is that kind of feeling/ depression normal and you just need to push it through or maybe it was a side-effect from those pills!?\n\nPretty excited to see your journey. I will definitely post here once I quit!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dc9a4i/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_and_im_proud_of_myself/f2e73gb/"}
