I've tried a bunch of different approaches to quitting and I decided to combine a few, first of all being mindful of how I treat myself when I \"treat myself\" and understand that all of that shit was destroying me. There was some visualizing involved as well, along the lines of a chaos magick approach. Sort of casting clear intentions into the universe. This is both very similar to the book \"The Secret\" but also not at all like that book and I hate that book. Anyway, thank you for the support!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dc9a4i/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_and_im_proud_of_myself/f27utml/"}
