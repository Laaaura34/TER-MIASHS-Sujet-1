Does it make you feel comfortable and safe? Maybe this isn\u2019t your problem and I\u2019m misunderstanding but if this were me I\u2019d do everything to be comfortable in my own home (my apartment is pretty small too but I make it feel like home). Adding plants, even taking care of them is rewarding, keeping the place clean, decorating, etc. Hope this helps in some way.
