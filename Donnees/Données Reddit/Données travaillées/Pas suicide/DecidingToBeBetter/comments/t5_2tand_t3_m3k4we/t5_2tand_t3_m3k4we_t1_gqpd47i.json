For a couple of centuries it has left behind its origins and mean pleasant or kind.\n\nI don't think of any of the negative connotations you associate with it, so I don't object to being nice.  I would never follow up someone describing a person as nice with a query about what's wrong with them.  I wouldn't at all associate it with someone lacking in some way, at least any more than any of us are.  That is, of course, unless it's used in the ironic \"nice guy\" label, but that usage wouldn't corrupt the whole word since that only works if the guy is not in fact nice in reality.\n\nI completely reject the idea that someone who is nice is only so because they \"don't know any better.\"  That seems very far off-base to my understanding of the word.\n\nPerhaps I'd have a better understanding of your view though if you described some situations where you think one could be kind without being nice or vice versa.  Examples may help crystalize the distinction.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m3k4we/decide_to_be_kind_and_not_nice_because_there_is_a/gqpd47i/"}
