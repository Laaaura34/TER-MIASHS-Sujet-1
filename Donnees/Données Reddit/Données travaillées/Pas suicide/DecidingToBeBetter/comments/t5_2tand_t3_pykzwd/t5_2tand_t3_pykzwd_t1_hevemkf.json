Gratitude, gratitude, gratitude. Get a book and write every single tiny thing that has happened that day that you\u2019re grateful for. Read it every night before bed. \n\nThe more grateful you are the more grateful you feel. The more grateful you are for the tiny things in your life the more abundance you will attract to you. After all, why would life give you more when you can\u2019t truly feel how much you already have. \n\nStart small - give it time and I promise you will soon start to feel it instead of just saying it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pykzwd/how_to_appreciate_the_small_things_in_life/hevemkf/"}
