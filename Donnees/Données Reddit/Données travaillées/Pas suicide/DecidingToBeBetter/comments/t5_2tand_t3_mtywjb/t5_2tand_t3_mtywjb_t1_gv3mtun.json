I encourage you to just start and write about anything for now. It is amazing how much you will learn just going through the steps.\n\nI started a blog four years ago. I reread some of my first posts and they were horrid! lol  But if I hadn't started I wouldn't have learned how to actually write a good story.  \n\nIf you are struggling with motivation write yourself a list with deadlines. Set a goal of just being able to check items off your list even if they were not done perfectly.\n\nFor example, to start you could have a list like:\n\n* Select a topic or niche (you can fine-tune this as you grow, just pick something)\n* Select a blog name\n* Apply for a WordPress site\n* Fill out your profile and WordPress details for your site\n* Write three 500 word posts (set separate due dates for each)\n* Share the link for each post on at least one social media platform (could even be your Reddit profile)\n* Set up a simple home page on your site\n\nYou may already have some of these tasks done, go ahead and add them to the list anyway and check them off so that you can see that you have made some progress.\n\nGood luck!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mtywjb/wanting_to_create_a_blogwebsite/gv3mtun/"}
