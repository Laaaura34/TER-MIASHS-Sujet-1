It looks like you're better, but if you want to get better, i think you need to learn to handle shame better. \n\nDestructive thinking may be something you need to work through (you'll need to decide), and if you have access to a therapist or counselor, it may be something to discuss how it happens and how to handle it.\n\nAs for masturbation, that's something you may want to discuss with your partner. If pornography isn't something either is comfortable with, you should find different ways to masturbate or satisfy your urges - be it erotic literature, pictures of your partner (not necessarily explicit), or using tools. With addictions/compulsions, substitution is much more effective that deprivation because it lets you change the habit instead of fighting it and relapsing. \n\nBut if you think abstinence is your path, have compassion for your past and future selves. \n\nFocus on what's most important here: your partner's trust and your self compassion.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l8503m/price_of_pornography/glbg45w/"}
