What can you learn from this? Try to really draw out those insights and learn even more about yourself. Use that knowledge to fortify the weak spots in the wall you\u2019re trying to build between you and this addiction. It may always be there, calling to you, but you have come a long way. Just because you went back doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re back at the beginning. Get your head back in the game, be proud of what you\u2019ve learned and how you\u2019re going to use this knowledge. It\u2019s a huge win that you acknowledge there\u2019s a problem. A mental health counselor who specializes in addiction will be able to help you. Addiction is a beast.
