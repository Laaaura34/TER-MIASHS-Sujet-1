You can also look to a sex therapist. Sounds like a weird job title but they do a lot of this type of thing. \nI am a nurse, I have been to a counselor for about a year. A lot of anxiety and depression. I had issues in my sex life too. One thing I will say is that if you are having serious thoughts about suicide I would recommend Calling the hotline, they can connect you with a therapist right then and there and will also know how to get a therapist set up for the future. Remember you are loved. Hang in there. I know it is tough.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l8503m/price_of_pornography/glb1k50/"}
