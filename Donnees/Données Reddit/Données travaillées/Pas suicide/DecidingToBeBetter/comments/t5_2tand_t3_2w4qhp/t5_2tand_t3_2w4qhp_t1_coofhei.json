It's really interesting, I'm able to get out of my comfort zone quite easily when it comes to work or social events, but I always end up watching the same things. Might have something to do with just wanting to press play and relax without having to make decisions, since you usually watch movies/series in the evening. Think I'm going to invoke a new rule though, not allowing myself to watch anything else than what's next in my \"to watch\" folder, and therefore eliminating the process of having to choose altogether. Might seem like a ridiculously small change, but every little bit helps!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2w4qhp/how_to_realize_if_youre_wasting_your_days/coofhei/"}
