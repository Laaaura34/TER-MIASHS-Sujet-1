Perhaps you are hard of hearing? Perhaps you get overly excited? Perhaps you think that what you have to say is more important than what another person has to say and you are speaking loudly to talk over them? Perhaps the muscles responsible for speaking volume are too physically tense? Generally when a person is calm, grounded, and their thoughts are organized they speak in a deeper tone and a slower tempo. \n\nLook into grounding meditation. Pay very close attention to what the other person is saying and focus on observing eye contact and body language. Take a mental note of the intonations of their voice and vocabulary and really listen, don't just think about what you're going to say next. This kind of mindfulness will help calm you down and lower the volume of your voice. You can learn all about what I'm saying on Youtube.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cugy3d/this_is_my_default_volume_when_speaking_any/exw5iax/"}
