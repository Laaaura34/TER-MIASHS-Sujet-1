You won't fix it overnight, but since you are taking steps to improve, you will get better over time. You're breaking an old habit and forming a new one, which will take time. The more you do catch yourself and deliberately tone down the volume, the more easily you'll catch yourself in the future, and eventually it will become difficult to do anything but maintain that normal tone of voice. Practice, practice, practice, and not only will you establish the habit of speaking at a more reasonable volume, you'll have built up your mindfulness skills, which you can then put to use in other areas.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cugy3d/this_is_my_default_volume_when_speaking_any/exunzsx/"}
