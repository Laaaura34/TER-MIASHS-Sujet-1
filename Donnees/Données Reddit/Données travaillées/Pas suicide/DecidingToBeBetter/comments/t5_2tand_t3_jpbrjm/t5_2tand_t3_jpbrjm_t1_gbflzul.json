I absolutely agree, journaling could be a fantastic way to re-evaluate your life. After some time you start to acknowledge the obstacles you already overcame and that life isn\u00b4t that hard if you yourself don\u00b4t make it hard. Sure, there are challenges but it\u00b4s your decision to make them bigger than they are or take them and master them without drama. \n\nAnd it doesn\u00b4t even need much time. 5 minutes right after getting up and 5 minutes before going to bed are enough. It\u00b4s mindboggling to think that a mere 10 minutes if mindfulness self-reflection could increase your wellbeing but it is.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jpbrjm/journal_journal_journal/gbflzul/"}
