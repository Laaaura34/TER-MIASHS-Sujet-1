I\u2019ve used several approaches. 1. The artists way by Julia Cameron suggests \u201cdaily pages\u201d each morning before doing anything else, just open your journal and write 3 pages of brain dump. Anything at all. Sometimes I feel pressured to meet the page requirement and feel silly with what I write, but I guess that\u2019s part of it. 2. Write before and after a big life event to reduce stress. 3. Sometimes I\u2019ll pick a theme like \u201cwhat gives me fear at this point in my life\u201d or \u201cwhat am I super grateful for\u201d or \u201cwhat has been accomplished as of late.\u201d 4. I read A New Earth by eckhart tolle and honestly don\u2019t remember whether or not he discussed journaling directly. But he talks about pain bodies, which are the accumulation of all the hurtful and damaging experiences in our lives since childhood that we carry around with us. Shadow self type of thing, I believe. I do a pain body check in every now and then to recount the nasty stuff and take accountability for how it has affected me. The first one was really tough and I had to stop and was shook for the rest of the day, lol. But a pretty good practice overall. \n\nI\u2019ve found that searching about journaling on YouTube can be helpful too :) good luck and have fun", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jpbrjm/journal_journal_journal/gcu97ro/"}
