I pretty much have my boyfriend and my family. Makes me feel kinda lame and lonely in its own way, but I also don't have much energy or motivation to make more friends. Kinda like you shared, we barely ever see each other and we're not very close. Could be due to my anxiety but it hurts because I know it's easy for some people to make friends.\n\nYour friend has a lot on their plate right now yes, but I'm sure they would be so grateful for any gesture during this adjustment. It's great that you were able to be strong and firm with keeping your ex out of your life.\n\nI'm hoping to be and feel better, and I hope you can too! You have every reason to feel proud.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd8ide/im_sorry_if_this_doesnt_belong_but_i_feel_proud/fjg5xeo/"}
