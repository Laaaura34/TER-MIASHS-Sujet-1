My husband has struggled with sobriety and relapses too and we are just now really both putting in a huge amount of effort to repair our marriage. I realized that it wasn't all just him, either. I developed codependency, neediness, insecurity, control, and other issues that negatively affected the marriage. We're working on ourselves separately and together. I can already feel a huge improvement in our relationship and it'll make us better people regardless. We get caught in our own destructive pattern of behaviors and it's hella hard to change, but it's possible. I really hope things work out for you two!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jf5o6j/you_know_what_im_gonna_get_my_marriage_back_im/g9igj41/"}
