Now that my vacation started I want to try to keep waking up at 9 and not later.\n\n I know 9 is still not really early. But for some reason everytime I wake up later I feel kinda bad the whole day, like today I have had a headache the whole day.\n\nAlso I do occasionally do some cleaning around the house and I also have to do schoolwork. And I started gaming a lot again with friends which is really fun too. And in the netherlands we can still go outside which is also not too bad. \n\nBut I defenitly agree with having a routine, makes you feel a lot better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g2movw/i_am_following_a_routine_from_past_23_days_and_i/fnp7l5d/"}
