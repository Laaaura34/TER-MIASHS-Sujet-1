Keep it up!  Atomic Habit is a great book, and one of my favorite quotes is, \u201cDon\u2019t miss twice\u201d. When you have a good thing going, like for me I\u2019m training like a badass right now, but every 5-6 days I can\u2019t muster the energy to workout. I don\u2019t. And that\u2019s OKAY. But I don\u2019t miss twice. Don\u2019t miss twice and you\u2019ll stay on track and turn the habit into your natural routine. So happy for you!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g2movw/i_am_following_a_routine_from_past_23_days_and_i/fnno9tq/"}
