I read R. Dahl's 'The Twits' when I was younger and a passage always stuck with me:\n\n'If a person has ugly thoughts, it begins to show on the face. And when that person has ugly thoughts every day, every week, every year, the face gets uglier and uglier until you can hardly bear to look at it.\n\nA person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts it will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely'. \n\nI am not even close to the prettiest girl in town, but I have broken a couple of hearts. I bet you are a looker and you don't even know it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm77dj/i_want_to_stop_being_a_mean_cold_btch/hcgqx2c/"}
