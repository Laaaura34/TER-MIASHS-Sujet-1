It's hard to have a rough start in life, and it certainly seems like you have. Your anger at others is understandable, and it sounds like you developed a bit of a prickly exterior as a defense mechanism for the bullying you received. Again, this is totally understandable. But as you've recognized, it probably isn't a great way to live.\n\nMy advice would be to start small. Set a few goals you can achieve and hold yourself accountable to that. Maybe one of them could be a new motto so you can remind yourself of this in the hard times? This is a bit earnest, but I like to think... \"welp, probably no God so if we want any kind of kindness or goodness we're gonna have to make it ourselves and help each other.\"\n\nYou might also put yourself in a position to practice kindness. Perhaps volunteering?\n\nAnd take it slow! Understand there will be ups and downs and forgive yourself for the occasional bad days. Then get back at it. We're all in this together.\n\nAlso, one more thing. Looks will feel a lot less important in a few years. I know this sounds impossible or unrealistic, but the pressure to look/be a certain way does diminish with time. And as you get to know people, attractiveness is almost always about who they are and not what they look like.
