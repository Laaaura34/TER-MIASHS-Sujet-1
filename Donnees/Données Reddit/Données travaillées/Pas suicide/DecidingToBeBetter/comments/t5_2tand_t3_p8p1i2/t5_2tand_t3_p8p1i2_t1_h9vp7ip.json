I didn't \"accept\". I just came to realise that whether or not I \"accepted\" it, the world just keeps on moving. The world doesn't care about my feeling. Only I do.\n\nThe world isn't as nice. That fact isn't going to change in the near future. What could change is, our own outlook, how we choose to see the world.\n\nThe world is factually bleak, however, there are brighter sides to the darker sides, if we actively try to seek them. Learning to see the brighter sides takes time. It involves a lot of trial and error.\n\nI don't have any practical advice to tackle the problem you're having. Just ... Don't expect too much, I guess? The world can be bleak. The expectation that it shouldn't be bleak is what hurts the most, I think. Let go of expectations. The world is as it is, with or without expectations.\n\nI become a tad bit more optimistic by seeing life this way.
