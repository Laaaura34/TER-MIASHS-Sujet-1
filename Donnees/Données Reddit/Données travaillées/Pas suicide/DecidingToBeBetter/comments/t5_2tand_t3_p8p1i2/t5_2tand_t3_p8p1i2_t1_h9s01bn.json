Remember the circle of influence. You can only control somethings (and how much effort someone you care about puts in to a relationship isn't one of those). Concentrate on where you can influence your life to be better, not things outside your control.\n\n2: if the world is going to be a better place, it needs people to take the higher road and keep doing good, being good. Kindness costs you nothing but is an essential foundation for a nicer world. Just because someone else is a mean, cruel piece of garbage doesn't mean I have to be too. At the end of the day, they have to live with themselves and i don't. Be a person you would be happy waking up with in the morning.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8p1i2/how_did_you_accept_that_the_world_is_not_as_nice/h9s01bn/"}
