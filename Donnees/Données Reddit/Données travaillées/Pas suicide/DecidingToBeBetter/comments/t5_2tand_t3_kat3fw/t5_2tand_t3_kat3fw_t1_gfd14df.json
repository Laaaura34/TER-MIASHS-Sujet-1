It only took about a week before I felt like my mind was working at like 200% efficiency. I'm shocked at how much it dulled my memory, emotional reflexes, everything, and things are so much better now. \n\nIt really tricks you into thinking it only mildly makes you kind of dumbed down, when it's really a lot. I was a functional stoner, I could do anything while high and act completely normal, but it turns out I wasn't doing those things nearly as well as I could've been. Again, i don't care if someone does smoke, and maybe it doesn't affect other people like me, but man I'm glad I can think clearly now lol", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfd14df/"}
