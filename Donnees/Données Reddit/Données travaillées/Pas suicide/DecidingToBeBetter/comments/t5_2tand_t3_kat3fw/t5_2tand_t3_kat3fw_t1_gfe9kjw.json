Its just very hard and most people fall right back into it.\n\nBut if you take a long break, fill your life with so much other, more productive, things until you nearly forget you ever smoked weed and then start a \"new\" relationship with weed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause most people start when they smoke for the first time: its a social and not so regular thing, they smoke maybe 1 a month but never need it in their day to day life. Some people then just fall into it like many do with cigarettes, start smoking every 2. weekend, every weekend and finally every day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the clue is weed isnt as addictive as cigarretes, alcohol etc. Its addictive nature is purely formed by your own mind, while nicotine for example makes your body addicted too ( on top of being super addictive mentally ). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThats the good thing about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut i got to admit most people cant pull it off and fall right back into it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfe9kjw/"}
