I\u2019ve been weed free for 23 days now and I love it. I really disliked the overall fogginess and numbness that came with it. Looking back, I don\u2019t care as much about the money wasted, but more so the time lost that I could have used more productively. I wasn\u2019t a total slouch by any means, but it\u2019s still kind of shitty knowing you\u2019re not working towards your best self. Had some good highs, but it\u2019s nice to ultimately have in my rear view mirror. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfcupqj/"}
