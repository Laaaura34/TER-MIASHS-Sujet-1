I do still dabble in weed because it helps me relax and can be a fun, enjoyable way to unwind at the right times while playing guitar, watching a movie, or playing video games. Better than being an alcoholic, although I do enjoy a nice beer sometimes as well. Some people can't draw that line though, which I understand. It's all about balance man. That's life. I'm glad you've came to this realization. Best of luck to you going forward!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfe2r0g/"}
