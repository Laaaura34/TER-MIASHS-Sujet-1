Even as a daily smoker myself, it\u2019s pretty ignorant not to know that being sober doesn\u2019t always equal to motivation and success. \n\nWeed is okay as a reward for completing tasks and for down time. it\u2019s not meant to be abused so it sedates and you technically become a vegetable.\n\nI don\u2019t smoke during productive hours anymore, but even when I did, I use to go to the gym, go to school and do assignments, study and even go to work baked. Not because I was force to, but because I liked working hard and then getting baked after my achievements. \n\nLastly, just cause you had a bad personal experience with weed doesn\u2019t mean necessarily mean it\u2019s a bad thing.
