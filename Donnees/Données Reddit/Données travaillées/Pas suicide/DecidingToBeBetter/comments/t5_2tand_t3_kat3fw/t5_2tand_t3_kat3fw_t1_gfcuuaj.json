Each one is like 90% thc as opposed to actual weed which is just 10-30%. \n\n\n\nI don't recommend it to anyone. I would finish a whole 1 gram pod in a few days, basically hitting it every half hour like a juul. After months of straight doing that every single day, my tolerance built up a lot a lot a lot. My entire room would be hotboxed in vape smoke, which is so much thinner than regular smoke, and I still wouldn't feel anything. \n\n\n\nFrom now on though I'm going to focus all my energy on getting to a point where I can smoke weed 24/7 like I was doing before, but without the guilt I guess", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfcuuaj/"}
