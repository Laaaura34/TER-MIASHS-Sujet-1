The high powered stuff worked in college and in a high-stress job for me, cuz I was under a lot more duress than human's normally would have been from a perceptual perspective (smartphones, networking, 100 tabs in my browser, hella emails, in-site call-ins, etc) but once I got settled into a stable routine, it just made me anxious as fuck. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike, my body and mind were used to GOGOGOGOGOGOGO mode, that if I smoked normal bud and wasn't exhausted from a full day of work, my body assumed I had more work to do and didn't let me enjoy the relaxation and my mind just kept telling me to go do the thing I couldn't do til the morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I can enjoy it occasionally (1 bong rip is nearly too much) if I have NOTHING to do the next day that's work related. Not gonna receive calls or texts from work, not gonna go in for a routine day, not gonna do SHIT but eat, lift weights, rest, hang with the boys, and sleep, and I can still only smoke the night before that. Hemp flower has been a godsend to maintain the health benefits from cannabis that allow us to maintain high function, without the need for that function so I can apply that new energy and creativity to my own life. And when you do get high high on occasion, you're almost planning out the lifestyle you can have where you can get high high everyday in the background.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfedtyg/"}
