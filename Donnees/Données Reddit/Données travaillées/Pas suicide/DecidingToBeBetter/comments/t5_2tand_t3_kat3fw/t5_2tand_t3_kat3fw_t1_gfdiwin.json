I'm looking for a way to use weed without butter so it can be fat free. I don't smoke. I'm just needing to cut out the fat since I think some of my arteries are clogged. It's unfortunate because I actually used it medicinally (I know I know, sounds like every other pot head).\n\nSome people shouldn't use weed. They just can't manage it properly. When I was using butter I would cut a small piece of it and weight it. If it weighed more than .1 grams I would usually not eat it. You get a slight effect but it's almost nothing and feels mostly like a normal day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfdiwin/"}
