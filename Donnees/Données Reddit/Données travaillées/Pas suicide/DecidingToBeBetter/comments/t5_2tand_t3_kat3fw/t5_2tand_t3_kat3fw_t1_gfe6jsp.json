In that time I graduated college, paid off my student loans, developed a successful career, got married, bought a house and two cars, and even got the Pomeranian I always wanted.\n\nBefore weed - I was also highly motivated. But, I was more high-strung and narrow-minded. \n\nI do believe everyone's chemistry varies. What works for some might scramble others. \n\nSo it's important to maintain perspective and do soul searching. Chances are there's more to OP's lack of motivation than just smoking weed. But kudos to OP for finding a starting point.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfe6jsp/"}
