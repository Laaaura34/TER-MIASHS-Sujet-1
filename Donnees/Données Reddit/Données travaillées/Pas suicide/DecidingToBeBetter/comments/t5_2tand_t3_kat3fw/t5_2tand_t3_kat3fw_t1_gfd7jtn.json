The way you write I can't really tell. You've decided that somehow without weed you will be this production machine. \n\nI can't imagine it was *just* the weed holding you back from working towards your dreams. There may come a point in the future that you feel you've worked on your dreams but still not gotten anywhere or not gotten as far as you wanted. What then? \n\nDon't think you're out of the woods because you've quit smoking. \n\nSomething led you to the extreme procrastination, and right now you are in a motivation high. I'm only saying this, not to shit on you, and tell you it's not going to work, I'm saying this because you need to be prepared for that inevitable bump in the road, slow down in motivation, or backtrack. Expect it. It will probably happen. \n\nYou will have one of those moments and when you do, you will want to go back to old habits. And when you go back to old habits, you might feel like a complete failure. You shouldn't. Motivation just like everything else ebbs and flows. Maybe it doesn't have to be so black and white, you know? \n\nI hope cutting out the marijuana sets a course for you and you never backtrack, but be kind to yourself if you do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfd7jtn/"}
