I've lost loved ones due to alcohol and drugs. I don't need drugs to do better, though if someone else does then I'm glad they get what they need.\n\nI still have problems just like you. Our problems may be different but they're both valid and important and worth acknowledging and working on.\n\nPlease realise I don't mean any of this out of hate, sometimes it takes someone pointing out a facet that you don't see in order for you to \"get\" it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfcot7k/"}
