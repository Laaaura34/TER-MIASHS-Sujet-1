Have hope for yourself. Yes, it feels impossible, but don't ever assume it's impossible for you to rise above yourself and be a newer, better person.\n\n2.) Have patience, lots of it. Not everything is going to go how you map it out in your head, but hope, faith, and patience with yourself are important to have. \n\nYou're already identifying some things that you feel aren't good qualities, and you're genuinely not happy with it and realizing the potential it has to harm both yourself and others. The fact that you're identifying this stuff is a big step.\n\nDon't drag yourself down, try and have faith to pull yourself up, and BE that better person you want to be. It's easier said than done; it takes a lot of time and even a lot of effort. You may even feel pain in the process. But after some time passes, once you get far enough and you're able to look back at some things about yourself and confidently say \"that's not me anymore\", it's a good feeling.\n\nIt's not at all easy to be hopeful when feeling all these feelings, but it's not impossible either, no matter how much it seems. Gradual steps. I'm working on it, too, every day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8ax3iv/im_honestly_just_not_a_good_person/dx2h9ig/"}
