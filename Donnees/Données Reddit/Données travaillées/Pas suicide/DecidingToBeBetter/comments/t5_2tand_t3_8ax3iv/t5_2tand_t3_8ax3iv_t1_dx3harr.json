I could type a long post about your mentality, but I feel like it might not get you anywhere. Not be concrete enough. But I feel where you're coming from and felt like I did this for a while. u/Shukakun has the better answer on the mentality. \n\nTry one of these things and you will see an improvement. Maybe not exactly where you want to be, but a significant improvement nonetheless. NoFap. Meditation. Consistent exercise (that is actually challenging for you, YOU). Cutting out social media (Tumblr, Twitter, FB, Instagram, etc.) Try doing one VERY simple, yet beneficial thing everyday (skincare routine, 10 pushups or situps, cooking a healthy breakfast) EVERYDAY. There are subs for every single one of these activities, so they are out there. \n\nChanging your physical reality changes your mentality. Most people assume it has to be the other way around.
