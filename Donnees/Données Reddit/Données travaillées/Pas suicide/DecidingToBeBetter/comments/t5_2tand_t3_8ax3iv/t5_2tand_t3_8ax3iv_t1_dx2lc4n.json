You're struggling, and that's obvious. I don't say any of this to dismiss what you're saying or feeling, but I want to point something out. You have said things that made me think you're doing those things for other people, and their validation (hobbies to impress them, needing their care and esteem). That's pretty common, and it's generally indicitave of an external locus of control, and a need for external validation because you don't yet have the ability to provide it internally. I say this because there's not much to be done about NPD besides lots of counseling, but what you're dealing with sounds like a self-esteem and self-control issue. This isnt a diagnosis, and I'll join the rest of the responders here and say you should seek counseling. So much of this sounds like depression to me, don't deny yourself help if you're suffering.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8ax3iv/im_honestly_just_not_a_good_person/dx2lc4n/"}
