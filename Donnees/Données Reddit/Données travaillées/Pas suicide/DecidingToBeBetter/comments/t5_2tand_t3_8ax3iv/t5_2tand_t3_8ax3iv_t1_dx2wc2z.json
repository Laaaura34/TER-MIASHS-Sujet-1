All of the behaviors you're describing are defenses to protect you from criticism or rejection.  See a therapist to work on developing compassion for self and to challenge your core beliefs about the world.  When you can feel safe and have love for yourself these defenses will no longer be necessary.  You're not a bad person, just a wounded one trying to survive like all the rest of us :) ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8ax3iv/im_honestly_just_not_a_good_person/dx2wc2z/"}
