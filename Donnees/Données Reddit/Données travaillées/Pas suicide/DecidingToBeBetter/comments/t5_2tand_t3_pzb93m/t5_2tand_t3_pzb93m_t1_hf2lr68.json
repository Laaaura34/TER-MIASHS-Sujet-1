I now live in a country where smoking is very illegal and impossible to get ahold of. \n\nAfter living like this for well over a year, I know it is much more like a medication for me. When I take it, I go on daily runs, am able to cook more healthy, and generally just feel better in my own skin.\n\nI will say though- I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I was on antidepressants and did years of CBT. I think my depression has gone for the most part- aside from some SAD. \nTherefore, the weed has been a medication to help against my lingering anxiety.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t tried more traditional methods for dealing with depression and anxiety, I suggest seeking them.\n\nEdit to add:\nI also had a shitty childhood. Filled with multiple parental divorces, suicide, and much more. I also went to college and got a STEM degree.
