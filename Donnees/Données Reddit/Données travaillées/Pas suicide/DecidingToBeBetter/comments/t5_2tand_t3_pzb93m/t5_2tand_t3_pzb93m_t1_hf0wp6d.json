And the mild hallucinogenic can give you an inaccurate sense of fulfilment (plenty of times ive \"turned my life around\" while stoned as if i crossed into new territory, only to repeat the same the next day with the same thoughts).\n\n\n If it helps, keep using it, but try to only use the days where things are really hard. And on the better days, try to go without. At the very least, talk to your doctor about the role weed plays in your therapy! \n\nAll the best with your struggles.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzb93m/am_i_self_medicating_or_fueling_my_depression/hf0wp6d/"}
