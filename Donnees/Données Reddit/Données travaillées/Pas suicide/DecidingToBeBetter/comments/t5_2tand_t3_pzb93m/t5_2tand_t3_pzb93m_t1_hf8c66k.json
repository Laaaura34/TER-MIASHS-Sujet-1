The stigma prevented me from being able to use it safely and instead sent me on a two year bender of experimenting with everything cannabis. I wish I could get a therapist to accompany me in a treatment plan. I saw one lady that I really liked for over a year, but living in a prohibited state, never felt comfortable disclosing my usage. I skipped smoking last night and had horrible nightmares (as I do every time I don\u2019t smoke; even as a child) and remember why weed was so appealing to me. It\u2019s a mountain of problems I just don\u2019t have the energy to solve. We\u2019ll get there though man.
