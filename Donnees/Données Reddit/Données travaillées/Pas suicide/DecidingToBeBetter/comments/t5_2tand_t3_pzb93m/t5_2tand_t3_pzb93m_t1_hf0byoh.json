I agree with so much of what you\u2019ve said. You\u2019re totally right. I\u2019m a little different because I do manage to still be high functioning (top of my class, clean home, take care of myself and responsibilities) but I\u2019ve met alcoholics that have managed the same. Are functioning stoners a thing? Lol. It\u2019s just difficult bc I really think weed saved my life. It\u2019s helped bring me down and live in the present. I just live in constant anxiety so in turn I\u2019m constantly smoking. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. I\u2019ll keep your advice in mind.
