It\u2019s my equivalent of a beer after work. I don\u2019t drink or even smoke cigarettes or anything else. The biggest problem is that I live in an illegal state so Im playing a dangerous game with my government job. I\u2019ve been to therapists for years and it\u2019s just too expensive. All medications I\u2019ve tried have made me worse. I know there\u2019s meds out there for me, I\u2019m just sick of trying out rx after rx when weed has fixed so many of my problems. Thanks for your response :) I hope you get the help you need, friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzb93m/am_i_self_medicating_or_fueling_my_depression/hf0chg2/"}
