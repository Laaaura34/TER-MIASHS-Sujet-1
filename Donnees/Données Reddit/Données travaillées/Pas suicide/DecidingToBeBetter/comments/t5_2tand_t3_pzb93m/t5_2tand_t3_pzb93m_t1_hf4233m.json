Paranoia is unpleasant to say the least.  Have you considered eliminating highly processed foods from your diet?  Exercising?  Focusing on improving your \"sleep hygiene\", for example no caffeine after 2 pm, keeping a consistent bedtime/wake up, and maybe adding a warm bath/shower before sleep with Epsom salts (they have magnesium which helps you relax)?  My cousin is a neurosurgeon who keeps crazy split shift hours.  He uses these tips as well as a eye mask (for daytime sleeping) and wearing socks to bed to keep his feet warm.  A good night's sleep can do wonders to regulate your emotions.  Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzb93m/am_i_self_medicating_or_fueling_my_depression/hf4233m/"}
