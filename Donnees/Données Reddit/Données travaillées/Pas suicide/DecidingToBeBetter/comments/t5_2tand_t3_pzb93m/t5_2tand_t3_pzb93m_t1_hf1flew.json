Sure I still support medicinal uses for other conditions, but depression and anxiety just doesn\u2019t fit the bill. If anything, it exacerbated my symptoms and even pushed it into a mild psychosis/detachment that went away after I stopped using. \n\nNot saying you have to stop, but daily usage is a bit excessive and I would advise tapering it down. What helped me was facing problems head on sober. If I had anxiety because I needed to do something, I accepted I had that anxiety and pushed through it sober. Plus sleeping well, eating right, and getting some kind of light-moderate exercise helps a lot.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzb93m/am_i_self_medicating_or_fueling_my_depression/hf1flew/"}
