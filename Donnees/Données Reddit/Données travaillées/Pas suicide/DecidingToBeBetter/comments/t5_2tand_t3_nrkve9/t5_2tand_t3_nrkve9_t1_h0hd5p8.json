It will also twist reality to create the issues where none exist. It\u2019s essentially insecurity inflicted on others. Case in point, it\u2019s unlikely she \u201cconfused\u201d you with an ex, probably just called you by his name or something. That\u2019s just a brain fart and we all have them. Another story you are telling yourself is that her getting a massage is somehow now infringing on an intimacy you share. Getting a massage from you is intimate, getting a massage elsewhere is relaxing. You making her a dinner is intimate, someone else making her a dinner is meal time. It\u2019s the feelings you share with each other that makes everything you do intimate, not the activity. \n\n Jealousy is a pointless, self-centred, controlling emotion that, ironically, does the EXACT thing you are scared of -alienates your partner and puts them in chains that will eventually stifle their love. I guarantee that the day you just drop it and learn to take pleasure in your partners pleasure, and give them the benefit of the doubt at every turn without even questioning, is the day your partners love and attachment to you starts becoming invincible.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nrkve9/overcoming_jealousy/h0hd5p8/"}
