I had my first kiss and lost my virginity within the same week when I was 20. For years leading up to it, I had crippling self doubt, social anxiety and fear. I\u2019m a female and generally considered pretty attractive and have a nice body. I would get a lot of interest but shut it all down without a second thought as a defense mechanism. I was so. Fucking. Fearful. Of everything, and existence in general. I didn\u2019t want to make my presence known. Deep growth and a lot of work on myself and the way I view myself and the world made the most difference for me, as well as lifestyle exchanges including regular exsersize, yoga and eating healthy. I never would have gotten past a lot of my fears if I didn\u2019t just fucking do it and throw myself into the void, only to realize there really isn\u2019t much to be scared of, it\u2019s mostly all constructs and stories your mind makes up.\nI\u2019m really happy for you, thank you so much for sharing!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/et3mig/i_had_my_first_kiss_at_23_years_old_after/fffrn83/"}
