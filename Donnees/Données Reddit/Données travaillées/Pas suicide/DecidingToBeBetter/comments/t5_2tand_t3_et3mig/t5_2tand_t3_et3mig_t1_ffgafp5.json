I think it has something to do with how I was bullied when I was five, it permanently changed my brain structure I think at that age and permanently lowered my self-esteem to make myself more of a target, and to perhaps interpret neutral/bad things people do to me subconsciously as something that makes me feel suicidal. I don't have a job because it's hell just having coworkers. I've worked on getting myself out there in the world much like you for years with grooming and dates and friends and saying yes, but I spend all my free time trying to argue in my head against the things I perceived that people say/do to me, too much to the point where some things people say takes years of work and I'm still not there yet. I've tried going to therapists, but either they're not helpful or they brag at you, in my experience. I just don't understand how seemingly easy people make life out to be, that is you just have a journey and some luck and work in a few years and bamn, you hit your progress markers of getting a SO.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/et3mig/i_had_my_first_kiss_at_23_years_old_after/ffgafp5/"}
