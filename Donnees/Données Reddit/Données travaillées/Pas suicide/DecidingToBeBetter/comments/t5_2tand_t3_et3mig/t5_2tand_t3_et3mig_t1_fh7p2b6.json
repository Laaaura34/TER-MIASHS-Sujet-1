We're kind of polar opposites considering I'm a skinny teen girl. But for some reason your story filled me with a different kind of motivation than I've felt before, mostly because you've pushed yourself out of your comfort zone so much. I want to achieve that one day, I don't want life to pass me by and go on. Maybe I should stop avoiding this particular topic as I work on my other weaknesses and start working on this as well. Thank you for sharing, I wish you the best of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/et3mig/i_had_my_first_kiss_at_23_years_old_after/fh7p2b6/"}
