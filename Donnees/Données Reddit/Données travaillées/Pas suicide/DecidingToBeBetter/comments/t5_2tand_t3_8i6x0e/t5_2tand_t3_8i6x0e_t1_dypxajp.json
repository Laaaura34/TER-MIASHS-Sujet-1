Why not develop your willpower and grit now before your life goes to shit? Your parents are going to die someday, you could lose your job, you could lose your ability to work. Remember that the next time you want to quit something, remember that you quitting today is only making it more likely that life will completely fuck you over when you are least\\-capable of dealing with it.\n\nGrit isn't something you have or don't have, it's something you train up like a muscle. Exercise it, push yourself further and further. Make commitments and have accountability partners. For instance, sign up to run a marathon with a friend. You will push your body so much further than you thought you were capable, and your friend will be doing the same, and making sure you don't quit.\n\nAlso, though it's not for everyone it works for me: shame. There are things I'd probably want to quit if I wouldn't feel ashamed for doing so. Shame is a fantastic motivator. Want to skip leg day? Well, you'll look pathetic with those scrawny legs you piece of shit, so get out and squat. Shame helps me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8i6x0e/im_programmed_to_give_up/dypxajp/"}
