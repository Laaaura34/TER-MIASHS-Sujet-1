Although, I think it's important to note that through observation and counsel of others, you can be wise without necessarily having to experience things personally. For example, theoretically, someone could give great investment advice even if they have never owned a single share of a stock because they obtained knowledge through speculation and simulation - this is relatively unlikely though. In summary, dont discredit someones counsel as unwise solely because they are inexperienced.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cvz5ek/adversity_and_loss_make_a_man_wise/ey80bde/"}
