It's a little easier to give advice to someone who's twice your age, but under 18 we should tread lightly. \nI grew up in a very abusive and dysfunctional home and it definitely contributed to some unhealthy social programming and tramas. So I'm well aware of how mimicking behaviors can work. Unfortunately for me, everyone in my family, parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc. were all dysfunctional so I didn't even realize how bad it was until I was in my 20's and living 2000 miles away. \n\nIt's good that you're realizing early the behaviors are bad. Avoiding the rapids before you get to them sotra thing. I could give a ton of examples and potential advice, but I think you'll ascertain more if you figure out some things on your own. I'd like to point you in a  direction that I feel would be beneficial. I highly recommend reading the book \"The Four Agreements\" by Don Miguel Ruiz. It'll give you some insight on the power of words (and thoughts) as-well-as some basics of social programming,  not taking things personally and not perpetuating unhealthy behaviors. \n\nThere are more resources, but this one is simple to read and comprehend, others are more like homework. I wish someone would have given it to me at your age. If you find it helpful and have any questions I'd enjoy following up. \n\nNot liking what you see in the mirror is the first step to changing the view. I wish the best to you and hope you find the wholesomeness you're looking for.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcrprv/i_am_scared_i_am_abusive_or_going_to_be_in_future/hal2l4p/"}
