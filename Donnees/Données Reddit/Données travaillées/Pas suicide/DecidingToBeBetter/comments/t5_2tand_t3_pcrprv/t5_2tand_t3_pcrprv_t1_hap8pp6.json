I just cut off 99 percent of people out of my life, including my girlfriend whom i was going to marry year down the lane, it killed her soul but i couldn't let her be another victim of this generational radical patriarchy.\n\nAfter some time i had realised that I'm behaving the same way with my gf as my father did with mum and sis, which made both of them go through this trauma-bonding eventually making them blind as to know how manipulative he is.\n\n\nFocus on yourself Op \n\nWrite down your trigger points\n\nMeditate, focus how much casual contempt you are casting on people you encounter on daily basis\n\nTry to widen your horizons, pick up some self- help books\n\nTend to a hobby( i picked up music production and poetry) and so on.\n\n\nBest of luck to you, i am sure you'll come better sooner than you'd expect because you are starting early!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcrprv/i_am_scared_i_am_abusive_or_going_to_be_in_future/hap8pp6/"}
