I'd try to figure out what the books are for your situation and read them. You want to avoid just falling down a rabbit hole of getting advice from YouTube etc, as it can steer you wrong. There will be recognised authorities and experts on breaking abusive cycles, so find those (look at numbers of reviews on GoodReads for example). Having a quickly look, it seems like someone called Beverly Engel is the biggest author in this field with lots of books to choose from. You can probably find some in your library or audiobook if buying them is hard. There will also be lots of more general guides to self help, and self improvement can actually become a fun hobby/interest, so maybe just try to read the biggest and best books and blogs on self improvement. Finally, try not to worry too much about it. The fact you are aware of it probably means you stand an excellent chance of not repeating it. And don't think of self-help as 'fixing' something wrong, it's more like you are learning a new skill, the skill of how to regulate your emotions and behaviour is a positive way. It will pay dividends throughout your life and its the type of thing everyone should do!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcrprv/i_am_scared_i_am_abusive_or_going_to_be_in_future/ham4yn0/"}
