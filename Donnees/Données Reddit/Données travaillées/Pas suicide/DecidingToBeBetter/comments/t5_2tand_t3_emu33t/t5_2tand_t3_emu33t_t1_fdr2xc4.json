If you can\u2019t go for the full hour don\u2019t just skip it. Try to fit in a quick work out wherever you can. Also what you plan on doing in the gym is important, cardio burns way less calories than weightlifting, so on your quickies I would prioritize that.  \n\nThe gym can also be a social place, you can offer your friends to work out with you or make friends while working out. I went to a gym local to where most of my friends lived and often we would run into each other and do a few sets together and catch up. It\u2019s possible to stay in good shape, get good grades, and be social.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/emu33t/how_do_you_balance_school_gym_work_and_social_life/fdr2xc4/"}
