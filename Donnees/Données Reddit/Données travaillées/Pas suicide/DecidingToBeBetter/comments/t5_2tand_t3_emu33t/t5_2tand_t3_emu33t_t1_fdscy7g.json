Balance those 4 things seem hard. Don't forget sleep and healthy food too hahahah. \n\nfor real though. I'd suggest improving one of your goals too. make a priority list. for example:\n\n1. sleep & food\n2. school\n3. social\n4. work\n5. gym\n\nfix the first things first before you step down on your ladder. don't set too high goals either. if you sleep at 00:00 usually and you want to go to bed earlier, set a goal to sleep at 23:30 first for a while.\n\nHabits need to be established first before they can be improved on.\n\nOfc your priority list can switch during the weeks/months you improve yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/emu33t/how_do_you_balance_school_gym_work_and_social_life/fdscy7g/"}
