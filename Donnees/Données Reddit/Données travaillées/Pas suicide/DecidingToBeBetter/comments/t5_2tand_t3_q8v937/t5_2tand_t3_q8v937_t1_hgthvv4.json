I was already depressed and working and worrying about bills on a low salary stressed me out. You will constantly be on edge because you do not know when/if an emergency bill will pop up. Yeah, I had savings but I was scraping by.\n\nMy legs hurt everyday and I gained weight. I also had less energy and desire to work on my passions and that made me even more depressed. And because I dropped out, I was depressed that I didn't have a degree (not that that matters anyway). \n\nSo, I moved in with my parents and contacted local businesses and worked with them to make photo and video content. It took about a year and it was scary but worth it. Word of mouth really helped. I make more than if I graduated lol. If I lived like I was living on my own, I would be stuck there forever, I really believe it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8v937/should_i_give_up_my_studies_and_start_working_f23/hgthvv4/"}
