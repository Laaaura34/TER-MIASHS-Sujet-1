I was having a hard time between studying and doing exhausting extracurricular stuff (managing a students association) and often thought i should just forget it and become self-employed or something by using my video editing and social media skills. \n\nI slowed down, finished the year and now i feel a lot better - and i know i WANT to continue. \n\nThe problem today - i think - is that we are so goddamn bombarded with conflicting  instruction of who we should be,, fake gurus and \"entrepreneurs\", fake portrayal of people's lives (looking at you Instagram, also TikTok i'd say) etc.\n\nWe see a 18yr old on TikTok or YouTube in a Lamborghini or someone on IG posting about hustling, making millions at 25 or something, and we think we've \"lost\" or we're too late for success. Of course, that is bullshit.\n\nNow that things have calmed down i'm reaping the benefits of not having given up. I wrote my first article on International Relations, i have a full Paper on the way (for which they'll pay me) and, most importantly i might add, a warm heart knowing that i have lots of friend that love me and i love them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think you got to fake it 'til you make it. That's kind of what i did. These things take time to bear fruit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you nothing but the best, and hope stuff gets better soon \ud83d\udc9b\ud83c\udf40", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8v937/should_i_give_up_my_studies_and_start_working_f23/hgs2gdv/"}
