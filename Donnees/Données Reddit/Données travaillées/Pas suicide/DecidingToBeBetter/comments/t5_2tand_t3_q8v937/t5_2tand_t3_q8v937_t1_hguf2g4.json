I know you said you hate animation but maybe visit an animation studio also.\n\nYou might just be exhausted.. but you might have forgotten what you are working towards because you have so much pressure from school and other sources.\n\nIf you don't try getting in touch with what your job would be maybe pull a few of your early drawings.. from when you were a teenager.  Try drawing them again now and give yourself a chance to remember what inspired you to go down this path in the first place.. good luck op!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8v937/should_i_give_up_my_studies_and_start_working_f23/hguf2g4/"}
