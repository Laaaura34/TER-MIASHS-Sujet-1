That alone is an accomplishment. It is easy to get burned out. I totally get it. My last semester was a STRUGGLE! I got my only C that last semester. What helped me get through it was remembering where I started. Imagine you are on a mountain and you can see the peak above you. And it is the hardest portion but the closest. Then imagine turning around and looking down to the base. It is super far away. Remember that you started down there. Remember that there was a point in your journey where you stood at base camp and looked up at the peak and said \u201cthat is so far away\u201d Maybe you couldn\u2019t even SEE the peak when you stood at the bottom. But now remember where you are now. \u201cBottom-of-mountain\u201d version of you would kill to be where you are. And that person worked really hard to get here. So keep going. You\u2019re very close. And although it is the hardest part... it is the shortest.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g8pehow/"}
