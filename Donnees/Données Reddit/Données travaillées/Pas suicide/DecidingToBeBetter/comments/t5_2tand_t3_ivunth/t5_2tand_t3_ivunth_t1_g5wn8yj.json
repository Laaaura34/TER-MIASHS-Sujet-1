I'm in a somewhat similar situation, 25 no HS diploma but I did go to community college last semester, hoping to go again next year. Many lessons you shared I somewhat had in the back of my mind but I always thought to myself *\"this will never work.\"* \n\nHearing your story makes me feel like what I'm doing there will be a light at the end of the tunnel eventually. You are an inspiration to those of us that still yearn for a better life, and you're right, we're the only ones we can accomplish that. \n\nI really admire your drive, keep winning at life dude and again much thanks for this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5wn8yj/"}
