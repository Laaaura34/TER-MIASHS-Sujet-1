This story was exactly what I needed to read today since I've felt like completely giving up on life lately. \n\nMain question: how did/do you keep yourself motivated every day? \n\nSide question: how can I afford to go back to school with my low-income, no financial support from family, and a 1.6 GPA from my first go at college? I know I want to get a degree, it's my biggest goal in life, and I can see what mistakes I made in the past, but I still feel like I messed up that big once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I'll never qualify for something like that again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5wpazg/"}
