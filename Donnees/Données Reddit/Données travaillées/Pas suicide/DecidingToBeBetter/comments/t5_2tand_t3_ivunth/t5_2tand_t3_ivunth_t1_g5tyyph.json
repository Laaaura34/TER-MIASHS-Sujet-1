I love how you organized this by explaining chronologically what happened in your life and then summarizing with the epiphanies/life lessons you learned from those experiences. I can feel your joy and feel it for you. It might have felt like a long road from where you began, and I think so many people look at where they are and feel like the effort will be so great and take so long that they never even take the first step. But I think that\u2019s a key piece to reaching a big goal- just look at the next step you have to take, and figure out what you need to do to be successful with that. Before too long you will see the results of your efforts and realize that you can achieve a goal that might have previously seemed overwhelming. I feel you captured that piece of things really well also. There\u2019s such satisfaction in striving to be the best version of oneself, and it sounds like you\u2019re nailing it! Thanks for being such an inspiration to others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5tyyph/"}
