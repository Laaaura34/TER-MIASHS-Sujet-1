I loved your story, you really inspired me to just do the things I want to do and take them seriously as my life goals. Thanks for sharing \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n\nAND , I have an issue I want your advice ON (if anyone else wanna help out, please do) . As an undergraduate student in her last semester (a heavy af semester because I had to recover from two classes I lost past semester, see another 3, plus part time job, plus thesis...) I really struggle (even from first semester) with the idea of continuing to do stuff and keep going with what I gotta do. It's like I loose all passion, all inspiration and let go of the momentum you were talking about and I cannot allow that to happen this semester... \n\n\n\nDid you struggle with it? Any advice you could give on it?\nThanks \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5xmwjh/"}
