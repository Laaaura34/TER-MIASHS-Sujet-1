Started in healthcare thinking I wanted to go to medical school, then shifted to nutrition (still in the healthcare field just less stress), then went to environmental sciences and that transformed into geoscience all within a 6 year journey. Since there aren\u2019t many jobs as of right now in the geoscience field, I\u2019m actually having some luck in the recruiting field and have some interviews lined up! Just like you I want to eventually move my job to my desired field of study in GIS but for now I\u2019m open to just about anything since I may prefer a different field even more. And if I don\u2019t I\u2019ll still have the professional experience. The aerospace field is highly honorable and looks great on a resume", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5v1mhf/"}
