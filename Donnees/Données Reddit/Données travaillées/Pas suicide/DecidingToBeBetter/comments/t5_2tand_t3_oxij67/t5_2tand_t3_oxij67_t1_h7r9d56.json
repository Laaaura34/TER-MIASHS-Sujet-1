Human beings evolve. It also sounds that he is much clearer about his love for her now than at that time. He also sees that he was manipulative at that time. That is good to see so he does not have to repeat that behavior. Sometimes we have to make mistakes to learn a lesson. He sounds to me sincerely remorseful. He just needs to learn to trust and forgive himself.\n\nBTW, I believe in healthy habits. I start my day making my bed. After that, I spend conscious time forgiving myself. Like Wolfiemiss20, I notice I always have something left from the previous day that I am making myself wrong for.\n\nForgiving ourselves is very important.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oxij67/you_are_not_your_thoughts_you_are_not_your/h7r9d56/"}
