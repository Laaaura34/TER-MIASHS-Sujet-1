Go to dog training, get into obedience or agility even if just for fun. It\u2019ll improve your social life, improve your mood, motivate you to take care of yourself and it, and THEN look for a girlfriend. \n\nYou can\u2019t rely on another person to provide this. What if the relationship doesn\u2019t work out? What if she leaves? Are you gonna try to guilt her into staying? What if YOU want to leave? Are you gonna stay with her just because you \u201cneed a girlfriend\u201d in order to feel ok/motivated to enjoy life/happiness? That\u2019s a totally unfair position to put someone in - you should not be depending on a girlfriend for any of this", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1s4q9/a_girlfriend_will_cure_my_depression/hfgm7nm/"}
