So I'll try to rephrase everything on my phone haha\n\nThank you so much for responding. I feel less alone in this and also thank you for your kind words.\n\nI like the idea of \"do it scared\" a lot ! I don't wear jewelry but I might draw myself a little poster or something to keep it in mind. I agree with you, stagnation is probably the most painful part. It takes so much energy to start again but once you do, everything gets easier. I'll have to keep that in mind.\n\nReading your comment also felt nice because you cited pretty much everything that I already do. Like journaling, meditation, nurturing meaningful relationships (a tricky one), a little bit of stretching and walking also ! I've tried multiple times to create a routine for myself but I have trouble sticking to it in the long run. For exemple I love going on walks but it's like I forget that until I've put my shoes on and closed the door behind me. The same goes for exercise. I know how good it makes my brain feel but until I'm doing it, I don't remember.\n\nAs much as it pains me that I have to constantly re-take control of my life, I guess I could see it as a reminder that I do have control most of the time. \"Set a default mood\" I like it a lot ! \n\nAnyways, thank you for taking the time to write all this. I wish you the best as well !", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n4l7j0/what_do_you_do_when_its_starting_to_feel_like_too/gwxxbfv/"}
