I was doing it every time I drank, ~1-3 times a week. I also quit when I was late 22. I'm 25 now and I've done it like 3 times since then and it's fun but I am glad to have control over it now and don't do it. Great job!!! It's kinda tough/weird at first but then you basically just forget about it (at least for me, and you obviously sound just like me \ud83d\ude02).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxjckz/quitting_cocaine/gvr19um/"}
