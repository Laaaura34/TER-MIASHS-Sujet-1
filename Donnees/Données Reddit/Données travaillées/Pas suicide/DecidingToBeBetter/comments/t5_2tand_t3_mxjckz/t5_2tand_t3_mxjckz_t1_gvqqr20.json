I am a high functioning coke head with a daily habit. In the last 12 months has been really bad with lockdown and working from home. Been doing coke since 2015 but since November 2020 it's been hardcore, to an extent I've never done before. Currently on day 10 of a cold turkey hard stop. It's tough but got to keep eyes on the prize. Even after just 10 days my sinuses feel a million times better.  You must be feeling awesome, keep strong bro and hit that next milestone x", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxjckz/quitting_cocaine/gvqqr20/"}
