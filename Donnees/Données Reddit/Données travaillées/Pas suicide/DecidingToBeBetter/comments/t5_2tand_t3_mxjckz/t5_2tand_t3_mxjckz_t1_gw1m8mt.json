I can\u2019t get away from it, every time any event like the pub or a rave at the weekend comes around it\u2019s just right there. I\u2019ve quit for 5 months before but just ended up going back again, it\u2019s just a weekend thing but I know how much of a fine line it becomes. The lockdown made it easier for me to stop tbh I think everything opening back up is making it harder. I feel embarrassed even writing this I need to just take a stand.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxjckz/quitting_cocaine/gw1m8mt/"}
