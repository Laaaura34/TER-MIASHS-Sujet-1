So rough approx maths would that at about 0.3 grams per day on average but it fluctuated. I did more during the week while working and less at the weekends.\n\nThis isn't the first time I've gone cold turkey and won't be the last. I had the usual symptoms like fatigue, depression, lack of motivations and cravings. I was very very lethargic. \n\nThe two \"personal\" symptoms I have had, and I always have, are a flaire up of my psoriasis, on scalp, under eyebrows and facial hair and hardcore nasal congestion. One would imagine that not doing coke would clear your sinuses but for the first week all that shit is coming out and theres been some nasty scabby snot. \n\nI'm 24 days and 16 hours clean currently and feel good, but will always miss and crave coke cos it's fucking awesome. I'm holding out until end of month hopefully.\n\nOh another withdrawal which has been consistent is dreaming about coke every night. Not doing it but procuring it or talking about it. It's obviously very much still on my mind.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxjckz/quitting_cocaine/gxijcnl/"}
