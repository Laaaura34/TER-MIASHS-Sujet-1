It shattered and she fell into a pile of glass. I was a good kid, with a good family, and she wasn\u2019t abusive in the traditional sense just an asshole. I got less punishment for that than some of the usual teenage BS I did, probably because my dad noticed how badly my mother was behaving in the moments that lead up to it. \n\nDon\u2019t ruminate over your behavior, you were the child and your family were supposed to be adults. Focus on your behavior now, your actions\u2026 the things you do and say and what you put out into this world. These are the things you can control, and are responsible for now\u2026 make them the best you possibly can. \n\nI listen to a lot of Pema Chodron audio recordings It\u2019s really helped me personally to keep me in a good head space, hope it does so for you too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc806i/grew_up_in_an_abusive_environment_have_i_became/hhfhavs/"}
