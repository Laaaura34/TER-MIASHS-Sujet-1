You should be so very proud of yourself! I know I am proud of you.\n\nIn the future, I hope you consider mentoring. It is so much more powerful for people to see others they can relate to succeed, rather than be told by people who haven't been through similar things. It is also awesome for the mentee. It is such a confidence booster, and knowing you can make a turn your difficult situation into an exponentially positive one is powerful! Good luck in all that you do!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/koe66k/i_got_a_40_gpa_after_almost_dropping_out/ghtxkvg/"}
