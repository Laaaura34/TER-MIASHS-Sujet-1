I\u2019ve accomplished and gone through SO much but no one would ever know because they\u2019ll think I\u2019m showing off...thank you for being proud of me, we have to keep supporting and uplifting each other. I don\u2019t understand why people would want to drag each other and themselves down, I guess it\u2019s because they\u2019re unhappy but it\u2019s still shitty. I\u2019m so proud of you, too!!!
