However if I learn now to set my boundaries I feel like I can do it! And I don\u2019t really want to be a therapist per say but I would like to work in the psychology/behavioral field and help in the best way I can without emotionally draining myself... because it feels like every person I meet or every person I try to have a casual relationship with ends up getting slightly emotionally dependent on me? And that\u2019s exhausting especially after growing up in traumatic circumstances with having an absolute psychopath of a father. \n\nAll that to say... you are so right, and would you mind if I asked what you do for a living? And it seems like the ones who have had the worst lives can make the most difference :-)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/koe66k/i_got_a_40_gpa_after_almost_dropping_out/ghu0oty/"}
