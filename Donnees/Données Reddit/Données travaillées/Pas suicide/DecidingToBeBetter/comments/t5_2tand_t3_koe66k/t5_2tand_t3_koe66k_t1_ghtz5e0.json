And chances of that happening are higher if I give in to the inner demon telling me I\u2019m gonna fail and telling me it\u2019s not gonna work. I forced myself to make a \u201cschedule\u201d and even if I didn\u2019t really follow it, because I\u2019m awful at following routines, I still managed to use it as a base. Sooo when I have 4 classes I\u2019ll do one class I love and one class I like less on one day, and then switch... obviously didn\u2019t always work since I\u2019d end up doing it all in a day or two, but having it all written down and the deadline being there stressed me out and motivated me enough to get it done by the deadline because I have so much guilt if i\u2019m late for anything. that helped. So I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll work for you but maybe try using one of your own weaknesses against you if that makes sense... and I couldn\u2019t do it alone obviously, but the internet saves you for that. YouTubers and goal-oriented websites have so many resources to help.. :) sorry if this was a little rambley I just woke up", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/koe66k/i_got_a_40_gpa_after_almost_dropping_out/ghtz5e0/"}
