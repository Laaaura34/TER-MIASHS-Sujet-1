Many people in your situation would just blame their partner.\n\nI'd recommend finding a good counsellor to help you talk these feelings through and develop strategies to learn how to 'self soothe' and work through the anxious feelings. Also, know that you're not alone - plenty of people feel like this and although they may not rely on relationships or intimacy to escape these feelings, they may use alcohol, or drugs, or food, or gaming instead. The best defense you have is to deal with the feelings head on, take responsibility for them (which it sounds like you're already doing) and be kind to yourself. \n\nAlso, as the relationship progresses and gets stronger, you may find that these feelings naturally start to fade away anyway - particularly if you continue to work on yourself and give your partner the space she needs.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ngzccd/fighting_emotional_dependency_story_progression/gyw3kit/"}
