I\u2019m early20sF and I would have panic attacks at your age because \u2018my life was going no where\u2019 and I wasn\u2019t doing productive. A lot of it came from my \u201cdelusions of grandeur\u201d mother that made all of her children feel like if we weren\u2019t started a successful side business every other week, we were wasting our time on earth, despite never having worked for longer two weeks at a job. The only thing that really actually helped was being done with my associates degree, getting a well paying job, and actually being able to see the fruits of my labor growing. At 16, your labor is largely ignored and downplayed as less serious than that of an adult. I\u2019m not far from 16 but I was homeschooled and not really on like Instagram and stuff (hell Instagram wasn\u2019t even pretty back then, all your friends posted overstaturated selfies and pictures of flowers outside their houses, it was a peak at someone\u2019s regular life, not a curated portfolio of their best photos) and I still felt like that, I can\u2019t imagine how overwhelming life is for the average 16 year old today. My advice is do your very best to relax. You\u2019re only 16 once and even tho being 16 wasn\u2019t awesome for me, I wish I could go back, pat my head, and tell myself to take a chill pill. Use this time to figure out what hobbies you like, chitchat with friends, and maybe plan out a few places you really want to visit when you\u2019re older. I don\u2019t want to sound callous, I mean this earnestly, but the \u2018productivity\u2019 you create at 16 outside of not making terrible grades isn\u2019t going to mean very much in even just 4 years. Even \u2018not making terrible grades\u2019 only counts so far into making sure you have a diploma and then getting you to college if you want to go that route. I don\u2019t remember shit about being productive at 16 but I do still have the paintings I made then, the trinkets from that road trip with my friends, and dvds of the movies I loved at the time. I know it\u2019s hard but you\u2019ll feel better once you have more control over your life and when you can see a better return on your productivity but those things come with age and it takes time to get there. Good luck OP, I know this probably isn\u2019t the answer you were looking for but it\u2019s what I would tell myself at that age so I think it\u2019s worth telling you. sending good vibes\u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lj2cbc/how_to_stop_constantly_feeling_like_youre_wasting/gn8rcqx/"}
