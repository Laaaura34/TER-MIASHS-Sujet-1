It's really nice to just get in touch, if even just for a minute.\n\nI call my dad every day, for probably about a year now. I talk with my mom every few days. His calls are usually 2-10 mins long, my calls with my mom can last close to an hour sometimes.\n\nIt's really nice to just chat, and when you call that often, your conversations are usually much much more of the \"what are you doing for dinner today?\" Kind than they are \"what are your life plans, when are you getting married, when are you getting a better job\" kind of things.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gv6spf/talking_to_my_parents_regularly_has_been_great/fsmw45o/"}
