You should always moisturize your skin. We don\u2019t realize how dry our skin is until we age lol\nI am so glad your friend did this for you. Sometimes we are hard on ourselves and we all have probably been in your situation. I certainly don\u2019t mean your medical conditions.... because they are truly horrible and my heart goes out to you!\nI mean depression and a feeling of having no self worth. Just remember that there is no one in this world exactly like you. You are special no matter whether you feel that way or not.\nI think you have probably turned a corner and I hope this is just the beginning to a whole new world for you. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udde1\u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ms2wxs/i_finished_a_container_of_lotion/guspf0h/"}
