Good for you.\n\nCan I also just say people like you inspire people who want to change or feel like they can't keep going, I've also started the same journey of giving up smoking weed daily and it's been two days. I had a shite morning today and wanted to roll up but seeing this has honestly made me re-evaluate, so thank you so very much. Keep doing what you're doing because it's a positive step", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lo4hxu/finally_it_was_today_not_tomorrow/go4dln9/"}
