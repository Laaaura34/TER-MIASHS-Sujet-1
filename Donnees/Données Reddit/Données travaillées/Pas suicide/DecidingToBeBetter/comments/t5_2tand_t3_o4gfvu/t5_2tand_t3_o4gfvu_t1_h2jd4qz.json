This one is the best it's also the hardest and the biggest luxury for me. I'm trying to keep busy but as a single man I just don't have distractions on hand all the time.\n\nAs others have said intermittent fasting. I find it easier to wait than to stop. So my breakfast is lunch at 1pm I hang in until dinner and have some treats budgeted for after. I make sure those treats are things I can really drag out too. IMF is just eating in a narrower window. I've seen other claims about the benefits for honestly the main thing is it's easier to control your intake if it's in a shorter window.\n\nOne other thing is in that allowance for treats you need to have a little room. Sometimes I just really want to eat a thing. If I ignore it for days I can end up eating far more to try to distract the craving than if I bought it.\n\nThe milk thing is weird. Try other forms of hydration like water. It may not be as tasty but if you are getting a massive craving are you sure it's not just thirst? \n\nHonestly it's trial and error. Every time you binge work out why you did, what went wrong and how you can fix that. If a method failed, work out why.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4gfvu/how_do_i_stop_binge_eating/h2jd4qz/"}
