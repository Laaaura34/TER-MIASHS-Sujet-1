My word of advice for confidence is super simple: dangly earrings.\nThis really helps me, for some reason. I think it's because I don't wear jewelry much so putting funky big earrings on makes me feel fancy but it's so useful for me. People are also more likely to comment on the earrings than the hair as they are more comfortable with that.\n\nAlso, if you have straight hair like me, you need to make sure you shave it every week or two, or be okay with it at the odd growing out stages. Make sure to comb it flat into the direction you want it after a shower or it will just stick up. You might suit the hedgehog look though, idk.\n\nWell done for shaving it off, screw gender norms!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdaelod/"}
