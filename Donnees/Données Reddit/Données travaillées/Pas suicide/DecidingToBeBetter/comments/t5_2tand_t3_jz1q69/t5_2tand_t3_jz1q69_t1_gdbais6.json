I have a hair loss disorder. I\u2019m 21, lost my hair my senior year of high school and had to cut it like a pixie bob right before I graduated after having grown it out since middle school. At home I don\u2019t care, and I\u2019ve been working on going outside without anything but maybe a hat on or nothing (I went 3 years not leaving the house without a wig on). I just buy cheap Bellami or Kryssma wigs these days but wigs.com has much better realistic options for more if you\u2019re worried about it. Honestly since COVID happened I don\u2019t care and just have fun with cosplay wigs too.\n\nBut honestly? Hair grows back. And I think you might come to appreciate your facial features more. Makeup is another fun thing that always makes me feel immediately better although I am not a makeup type of gal typically, it just has that effect. Really, just know nobody judges you so much as yourself, the spotlight effect and all. Personally I think other bald girls are cute, idk.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdbais6/"}
