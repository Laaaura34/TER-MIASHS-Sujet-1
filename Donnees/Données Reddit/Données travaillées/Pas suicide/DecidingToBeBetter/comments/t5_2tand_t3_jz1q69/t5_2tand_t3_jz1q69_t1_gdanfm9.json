That being said... it\u2019s a haircut. And a head. And it\u2019s practical and it looks presentable. Actually I think it looks very good on men and women both.  \n\nThank you for challenging norms, because every time someone does, \u201cnormal\u201d gets redefined more and more. Maybe this is a hurdle for you, but you took it on because you knew that you were brave enough to withstand it. And if it ever starts to weigh on you, just think about how there might be another girl who thinks \u201cit would be super practical for me to just buzz my head\u201d or even \u201cI just think it looks badass\u201d and has you to thank for making that just a little bit easier of a decision to make... because it really should be easy to make that decision. \n\nThese walls have to get broken down over time, and you just swung a hammer.
