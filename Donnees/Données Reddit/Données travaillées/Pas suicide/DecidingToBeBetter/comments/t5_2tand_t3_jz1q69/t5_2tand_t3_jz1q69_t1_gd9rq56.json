I\u2019m a recently bald babe too and I was worried about what people would think since I work in a very customer centric environment, and thankfully, most people don\u2019t give a single shit. People will look, and honestly I think it\u2019s more for a curiosity reason than a judgmental one. I have yet to have a negative reaction from others which is fortunate. I also have enjoyed dressing more feminine and loving on the contours of my head and neck and cheekbones that were previously hidden by big curly hair. My husband LOVES my head shaven as well and was/is super supportive which has made this whole transition really positive!\n\nI do have to say, one thing that I was immediately aware of is that people may think I have cancer. It is a logical thing to be aware of. I had to remind myself that I don\u2019t look \u201csick\u201d that I don\u2019t have to have an illness to shave my head and it can be quite beautiful. I\u2019m glad I did it and I hope you enjoy your shaved dome as much as we have! Good luck to you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd9rq56/"}
