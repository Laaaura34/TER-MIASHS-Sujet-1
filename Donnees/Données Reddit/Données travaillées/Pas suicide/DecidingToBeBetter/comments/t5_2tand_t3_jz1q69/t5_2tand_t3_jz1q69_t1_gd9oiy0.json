As a teen, I learned to look for the eye contact as a measure of my worth. At age 19 I stopped giving eye contact and started staring into middle distance. I did this because there was a girl I met that was really beautiful and didn't seem to notice anyone around her. I watched her and wanted to be like her so I started doing the same.  I told myself that everyone was watching me because my lack of a need for eye-contact approval was making me more attractive.  It def seemed to make me more attractive.  \n\n\nThere's a good chance people really are intrigued by your new look and want to watch you to see what you're all about but when you look at them, they quickly look away bc they don't want to be caught starting. You could be reading this as disapproval. Stop looking at people (unless engaged in convo) and just believe that they see you exactly as you see yourself. If I were in your presence, I would def want to watch you to see how you moved through the world - any girl with that haircut is def someone I want to know more about, but I'd def also look away if you caught me bc I wouldn't want to be weird.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd9oiy0/"}
