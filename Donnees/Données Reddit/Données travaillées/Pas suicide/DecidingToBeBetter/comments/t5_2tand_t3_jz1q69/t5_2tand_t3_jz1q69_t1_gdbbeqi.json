I got a 3/4 sleeve done.. a lot of heavy black work.. and while I was super happy with the art and the process and I felt powerful sitting for 22 hours total to get it all.. as soon as others began to see it I felt so anxious.. I\u2019ve always had trouble being \u2018feminine\u2019 and at that time in my life I was going through a divorce too so getting back out there was hard when I felt like some roguish brute with all my ink.. \n\nI covered it a lot.. got parts reworked.. but now, even though it\u2019s unfinished (bc of COVID) I\u2019m happy with who I am with my tattoos now.. I\u2019ll never be small and dainty and overtly cute.. but that\u2019s just who I am. As I approach 30 it becomes easier to accept who I am too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdbbeqi/"}
