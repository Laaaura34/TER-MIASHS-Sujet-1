If shaving your head was a mistake (meaning you don't like it), now you know it. Imagine you had never did it and in 20 years you were still asking yourself how it would have been.\n\nI see girls with short hair on a weekly basis in my school. They don't look better or worse to me. What makes someone look good or bad is firstly taste, secondly how much they care for it. If your hair is dirty for example, it looks bad whether its long or short. \n\nFor me, I care how my hair looks to others, but Im not taking more effort than I feel like taking.\n\nYou can also talk to someone youre in a good relationship with about how it looks. If they like it, thats good. If they dont, its growing back. But any way, you know whether you care for their opinion.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd9xx7v/"}
