I don\u2019t enjoy putting effort into make my hair look good and some days I wish I could just chop everything off. I am scared though. Scared that my boyfriend won\u2019t find me attractive. Scared that people will treat me badly. I have said though that if I break up with my boyfriend I will also break up with my hair. Shave it and go travel where no one knows me anyways.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd9l8tp/"}
