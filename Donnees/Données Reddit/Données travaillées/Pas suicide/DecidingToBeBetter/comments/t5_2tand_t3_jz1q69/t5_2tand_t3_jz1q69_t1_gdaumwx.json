I was in college and had no time, nor care to deal with it. Enjoy it. The super fuzzy feeling and softness of it all. The strange way the wind blows through and feels. I never fit in as a girl so I stopped trying to be like anyone else. Enjoyed how different I was. It\u2019s a hell of a lot more fun than fitting in. You\u2019ll never win that game. Love yourself and take the time to see what makes you happy. It\u2019s funny we put so much importance in this thing that grew out of our heads and is now this dead thing hanging on us. Haha. Anyway, glad you have so much support.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdaumwx/"}
