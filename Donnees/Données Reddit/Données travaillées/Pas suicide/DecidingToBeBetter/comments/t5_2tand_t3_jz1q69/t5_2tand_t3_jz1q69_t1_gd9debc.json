Also good on you for looking for ways to grow and thrive. If you're looking for guides on emotional growth, insecurities etc. Here's a few resources that might help you\n\n- [*Running On Empty*](https://drjonicewebb.com/the-book/) by Jonice Webb (and its sequel)\n\nAmazing books that really help dig deep, gives you easy do's and don'ts for developing healthy coping skills, healthy habits. Etc. Really worth the read. The reason I HIGHLY recommend these is because they focus on emotional *neglect* which is often (and understandably) overlooked in favor of more visible issues such as physical /emotional abuse. However emotional neglect can be just as harmful as any other form of abuse and Dr. Webb Really helps you understand how to improve your emotional health and heal from your past.\n\n- [*Six Pillars Of Self Esteem*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79352.Six_Pillars_of_Self_Esteem) by Nathaniel Branden\n>The book demonstrates compellingly why self-esteem is basic to psychological health, achievement, personal happiness, and positive relationships.\u00a0\u00a0Branden introduces the six pillars\u2014six action-based practices for daily living that provide the foundation for self-esteem\u2014and explores the central importance of self-esteem in five areas: the workplace, parenting, education, psychotherapy, and the culture at large.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you're interested, Please join my community r/HealfromYourPast its new but i hope to create a space of healing and support.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd9debc/"}
