I am a girl who also shaved her head too! I am 20. \n\nI shaved my head for slightly different reasons. I suppose I just have shit genetics. But I found out I was sick a couple of months ago and it was a contributing factor to losing hair. Plus the unfortunate draw of the cards AND going through a stressful time in 2020 I was losing hair like crazy. So I shaved it off. \n\nTo be quite frank with you, I look a lot better with no hair. It fits my face. Would I sell my soul to have thick beautiful hair? Yes. Sometimes I feel good about no hair and sometimes it feels like I've lost a piece of my femininity and no one will ever love me. Sometimes I am nervous about what people think. Whenever I go to the store I see people stare. When I go running on the hiking trails I gotta wear a cap so I don't get scalp burn. Sometimes if I am wearing baggy clothing and a hat I can see people are surprised to hear a feminine voice come out of my mouth. It's normal to have anxiety and doubts. \n\nI think if you just stand tall and wear it confidently, no one will ever question you. At least that's the perspective that I want to keep and that I tell myself. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdaqnlp/"}
