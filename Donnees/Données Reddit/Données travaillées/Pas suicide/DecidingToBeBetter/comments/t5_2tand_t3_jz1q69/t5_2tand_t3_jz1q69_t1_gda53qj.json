I understand the fears of people's judgement and I am not discrediting your fears; but be proud of who you are and you quirks and your individuality! That way when people do love you for who you are, you know it is genuine, because you stayed true to yourself!\n\nYou do you girl. Be okay that others will not agree with you and work on being okay when you don't agree with others. But most importantly, be okay with yourself!\n\nI am proud of you for stepping out of your comfort zone and working on self growth. This is the way to be a better person. If you are always complacent you will never grow and nothing will ever change. A quote my mom would say, \"You are exactly where you want to be. You may not be happy about it, but your choices lead you to this point.\" (Before the \"that quote is inaccurate, some things are out of your control.\" I get that, this quote is for certain circumstances and doesn't apply to all situations in life. But with the above sample, if you do not work on personal growth, nothing will change. This quote would apply to this situation) Again, I am proud of you, keep up the good work!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gda53qj/"}
