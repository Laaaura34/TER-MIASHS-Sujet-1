A lot of people asked me why I would do that. \n\nHowever, I got more compliments from strangers than I do with my current very long hair. People would tell me the cut suited my face and some would even ask if I was Russian haha. \n\nSo the people who saw me everyday didn\u2019t like it, but people who didn\u2019t know me loved the heck out of it. I think that is another lesson in the same thing you\u2019re going after. People lose sight of what they\u2019re projecting onto someone (a friend not liking it) and what actually makes up that person (a stranger noticing how unique your features are).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd9bw4p/"}
