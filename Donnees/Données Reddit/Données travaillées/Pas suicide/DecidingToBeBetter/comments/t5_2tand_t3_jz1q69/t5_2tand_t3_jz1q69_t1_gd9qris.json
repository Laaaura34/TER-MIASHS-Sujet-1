I was definitely insecure about it initially, especially around family that was already judgemental of me.  After about a month I learned to ignore it and embrace the new carefree and low maintenance hair style. It is shocking at first seeing other people\u2019s reactions (my own mother cried for gods sake) but just remember that you didn\u2019t do this for them, you did it for YOU. The more confident you come across with your new look, the less you\u2019ll notice other people\u2019s objections. Congrats on your journey to freedom from toxic social norms and gender stereotypes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd9qris/"}
