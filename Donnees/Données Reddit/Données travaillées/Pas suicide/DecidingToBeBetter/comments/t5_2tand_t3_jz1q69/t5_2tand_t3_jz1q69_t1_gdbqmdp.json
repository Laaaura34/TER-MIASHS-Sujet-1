I felt so much freedom as soon as I\u2019d done it, it was truly liberating. But ngl it took me over a year to actually be comfortable around other people as a bald woman. I wore a hat a lot that first year \ud83d\ude02\nLike you, I questioned my ideas about beauty and gender norms and expectations about appearance for women, and I did initially get some rude comments or intrusive questions about why I was bald, along with many assumptions (that I\u2019m gay, I have cancer, I\u2019m a skinhead, that I was having a breakdown etc), but I eventually found that most people didn\u2019t care tbh. I also started to wear more makeup at first because I felt I was being seen as \u201cless feminine\u201d and was treated a bit differently by certain people (read: sexists), but eventually I said fuck it to that too and leaned more into androgyny which feels more comfortable for me. \n\nAs I grew in confidence about it and started to own it, I got more of a neutral to positive response. Now 5 years later, being bald and shaving my head regularly is just another part of my life. I have more confidence in myself, I don\u2019t feel sad about my alopecia anymore and I have a partner who loves that I have a shaved head. Confidence may take time to build it but that\u2019s kinda why you did this right? Getting out of your comfort zone is hard but worth it for the growth opportunities.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdbqmdp/"}
