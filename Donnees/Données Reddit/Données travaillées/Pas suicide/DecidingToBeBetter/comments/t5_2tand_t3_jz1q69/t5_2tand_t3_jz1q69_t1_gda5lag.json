We were just like, \"Oh yep. I can see how that's true.\" We chatted for a bit after our lecture about it and that was it. It wasn't some sort of 'galaxy brain' moment that we felt like we had to preach to everyone.\n\nIt's really not all that profound. It only seems that way because up until college you've taken most things at face value and haven't really learned any critical thinking skills yet.\n\nSome things are societal constructs but certainly not everything. People who think everything is a societal construct have gotten a little bit excited and carried away.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gda5lag/"}
