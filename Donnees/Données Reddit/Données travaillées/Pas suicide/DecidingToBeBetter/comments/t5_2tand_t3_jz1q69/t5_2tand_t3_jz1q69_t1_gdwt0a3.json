It may help to think of it like a mental muscle that you're exercising. To draw an analogy to weightlifting, 135 lbs doesn't magically weigh less when a beginner works up from a 1 plate squat (135 lbs) to a 2 plate squat (225 lbs)--they just got strong enough through training that 135 lbs feels easy. Likewise, you can't magically make your anxiety go away, but you can train yourself to become stronger mentally so that you'll feel confident despite feeling a bit anxious.\n\n(Incidentally, weightlifting is another great way for women to challenge gender norms while also building up confidence, strength, physical health, etc.)\n\nRegarding the whole, \"what are other people going to think of me?\" thing, here's my take: you love your haircut. Your boyfriend loves it. A lot of people really love short hair on a woman and even prefer it. A lot of other people don't like it, but so what? Would you rather be a forgettable blockbuster that tries to appeal to everybody or would you rather be a cult classic that took some risks and gained a small but passionate fan base?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdwt0a3/"}
