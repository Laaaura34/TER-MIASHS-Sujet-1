Cutting your hair short for the first time is really terrifying and yeah, it's rarely easy right away, but I'm positive that the anxiety you feel around others will dissipate over time :)   \nI've got some very prominent scars on my head and neck and throughout my childhood I used my long hair as a sort of shield to hide them, which became a really bad coping mechanism. In middle school I cut my hair short for the first time and for a while, having all my scars out the open was absolutely mortifying and I felt a similar anxiety when I was around other people.  \nReally soon though, without having a way to cover my scars, I learned how to be okay with people seeing them, and that anxiety went away. 6 years later though, I'm still not brave enough yet to buzz it all off lol. Your confidence is something I think everyone should try to shoot for. Good luck on the rest of your journey! <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdat5ns/"}
