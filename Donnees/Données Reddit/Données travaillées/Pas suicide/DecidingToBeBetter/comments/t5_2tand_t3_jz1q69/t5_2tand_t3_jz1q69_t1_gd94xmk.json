It\u2019s great that you feel more yourself when you are by yourself, but it\u2019s also great that you\u2019ve put yourself in this position of vulnerability because I believe that when you get through this, you will realize the strength you have to get through the self-tantalizing thoughts you have that comes with putting yourself in this type of discomfort. \n\nYou are so brave and your resilience will come out to prove that you are capable of getting through the struggles you\u2019re going through. Hair is just hair and it will grow back, but the potential lessons you will learn from this will empower you to embrace yourself. You will be fine and everything will be okay, even if these people who have no relevance to you may say or believe otherwise. Take the time to be proud of who you are and don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. You\u2019re doing just fine :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd94xmk/"}
