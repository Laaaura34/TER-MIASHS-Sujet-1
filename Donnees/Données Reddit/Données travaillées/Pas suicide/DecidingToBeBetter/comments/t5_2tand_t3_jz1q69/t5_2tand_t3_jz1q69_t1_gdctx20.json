It was a nuisance and i only had it to attract men. I promise you that beauty has nothing to do with your hair. You are gorgeous. Focusing on your happiness and what you want will bring so much more radiance and beauty to yourself than hair ever could.  This is an opportunity to find out more about yourself too. What else youre comfortable with, what makes you attracted to yourself. Once i got over my need to be desirable for men, i realized i was lesbian lmao. Hair grows back. This is temporary, but you can gain lifelong lessons from this. \n\nAlso when i was first uncomfortable about my hair, i focused alot of makeup and my outfits. That gave me a bit of confidence before i ended up being comfortable with just my hair. I wish you luck \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdctx20/"}
