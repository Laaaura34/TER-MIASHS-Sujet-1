Those people are sad and insecure in themselves and hating on others makes them feel less small for a short while, but ultimately brings them further down into misery. All you can do is experiment with who you want to be and make very small choices every day to become that person. If you want to be confident just ask yourself \"is this what a confident person would do?\" And do it. Tiny steps will get you there. You'll pick up genuine friends along the way. And everyone else doesn't really matter.\nFWIW, I shaved my head at 19 and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The controversy it generated fast tracked the growth of my self confidence and understanding of how and why people bully. It helped me change my own outlook and call myself out on some shittier habits I'd picked up. I'm by no means perfect but I have a much easier time acknowledging and working on my failings.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd9tjgw/"}
