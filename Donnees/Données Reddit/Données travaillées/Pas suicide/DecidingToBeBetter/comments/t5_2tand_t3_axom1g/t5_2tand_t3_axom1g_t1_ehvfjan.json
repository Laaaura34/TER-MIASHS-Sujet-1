Sprinkling in these large but non-scary \"useless\" goals I think might be a good way to build that \"doing stuff\" muscle. The best ones are the ones where coming up with an excuse to not do it seems silly, but the reason we don't do it is we just don't see it as urgent as the other stuff we need to do., yet it takes up almost no time, so it's just boring rather than scary. I think its important to differentiate boring and scary and tackle them separately.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/axom1g/advice_why_you_cant_motivate_yourself_to_do/ehvfjan/"}
