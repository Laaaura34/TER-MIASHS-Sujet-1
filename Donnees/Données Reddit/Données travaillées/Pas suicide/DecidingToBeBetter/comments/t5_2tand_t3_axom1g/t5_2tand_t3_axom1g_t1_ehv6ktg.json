I learned it from a short article: [The Do Something Principle](https://markmanson.net/do-something)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe idea for those who can't (or don't want to) read it: Most people see \"inspiration\" as the cause of \"action\" when in reality, the reverse is also true. \"action\" itself will trigger \"inspiration\" for future, repeated, actions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonal Examples:\n\n* I once cleaned my whole kitchen because I committed to cleaning up the dinner dishes\n* I was able to eat very cleanly for a few weeks, just because I decided I would log my food intake for a couple of days. I never committed to a diet of any kind.\n* I've been able to \"trick\" myself into more than one workout just by making sure my bag was packed ahead of time.\n* I had a work task that needed completion, and I snowballed into it by starting with \"I'm going to gather and sort all of my emails related to that project\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRead it. Take OP's advice. Apply it. Apply it more. Keep going!\n\n&#x200B;", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/axom1g/advice_why_you_cant_motivate_yourself_to_do/ehv6ktg/"}
