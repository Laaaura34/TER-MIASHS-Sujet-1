Well I\u2019m 42 and my mom died at age 55. I lost her when I was 35. I will say picking up the pieces of her life (going through her belongings etc.) changed mine forever. It made me fully understand that life is too god-damn short and you ought to spend it doing shit YOU like and that YOU care about. She spent her whole life suffering from anxiety and we saw only the secondary problems (the symptoms) like shopping and overeating. Seek a therapist!
