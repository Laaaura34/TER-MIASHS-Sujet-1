I really love it so I hope you do, too! It's not fast paced but I've watched it mayyyybe 10 times now (I watch it on every flight or if I'm stressed) and every time I see it more and more details stand out. There's another movie called oto-na-ri ([https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1314291/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1314291/)) that I only saw once about a hundred years ago but it strikes me as having a similar vibe so if you can find that, let me know (and please share since I'd love to re-watch it and see if it's as lovely and quiet as I remember!).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ph6rks/what_is_your_walter_mitty/hbium05/"}
