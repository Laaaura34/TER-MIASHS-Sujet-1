The music and humour are fantastic and it portrays an incredibly wholesome friendship of two friends who happen to find a way to the golden city. It's a simple adventure movie but I admire their openness with each other. Reminds me that it's wonderful to have real friends.\n\n\nOn the inspirational side:\n\n\nInto the Spider-Verse. Not only is that movie stunning in the way its animated, the story is just as captivating. The protagonist, the teenager Miles, doesn't quite know yet what he wants to do with his life. Everyone talks about his potential and want to see him succeed but he's not sure if he's ready and if he can take on all that comes with becoming an adult. There's just something beautiful in seeing his character growth.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ph6rks/what_is_your_walter_mitty/hbjj6wi/"}
