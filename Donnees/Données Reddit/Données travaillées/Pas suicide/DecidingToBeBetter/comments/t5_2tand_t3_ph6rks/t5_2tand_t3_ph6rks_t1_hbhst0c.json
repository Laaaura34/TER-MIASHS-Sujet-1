Something about the intentionally well crafted warmth of everything appeals to me in an aspirational way. A life that looks and sounds like this movie is a life of pure contentment. Everyone is likable and very human. The comedy of the main plot is also quite adorable.\n\nI will say I'll probably like it more than you as something about it just really gets to me, but I do think it's worth a watch for anyone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ph6rks/what_is_your_walter_mitty/hbhst0c/"}
