It involves a lot of betrayal, which is definitely not something to aspire towards, but otherwise it a story about a man who used his intelligence (and the help of others) to build an entrepreneurial empire, Facebook. The movie is not designed to glorify Mark Zuckerberg, in fact it probably aims to do the opposite, but its just fascinating to see this portrayal of Harvard students making it big. They start in a dorm room, end up in Palo Alto going to clubs with the founder of Napster, and in the end Mark is the world's youngest billionaire. It kinda shows that these billionaires are real people, and makes me feel I can find success one day too if I work smart and hard enough. By far my favorite movie, so I may be biased, but it never fails to motivate me. Plus it has one of my favorite trailers I've ever seen. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB95KLmpLR4", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ph6rks/what_is_your_walter_mitty/hbi9fd3/"}
