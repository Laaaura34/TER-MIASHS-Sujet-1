Same goes for socializing. If you want to get better at it, you need to practice it. My mental health has improved drastically the last two years and i feel very much at inner peace. The only major thing i want to change in my life currently is my social abalities. But i accept that this is hard and takes practice. I feel very uncomfortable when meeting strangers because i'm not very talkative and just don't know what to say. I think covid definitely didn't help, it's the first time I feel some form of social anxiety. However i do not let this bring me down, i know it's a work in progress and i will get better at it. Each uncomfortable interaction is a new experience from which i can extract information and learn. Make sure to reflect upon yourself and improve yourself. Slowly but surely you can get there. In a couple of years you will be so happy that you put in the effort to change.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm88xu/i_thought_i_was_getting_better/hchhaug/"}
