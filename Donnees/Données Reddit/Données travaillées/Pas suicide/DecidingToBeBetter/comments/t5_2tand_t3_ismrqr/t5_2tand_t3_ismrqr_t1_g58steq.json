That is the same deal here, you can get horrifically shit-faced for cheap cheap, that scares me every single day. We even have this local drunk guy that rings our flat, looking for his drinking buddy.\n\nThe flats look so similar and he gets so drunk that he makes this mistake all of the time and he reeks of booze-infused body odor. Many of my partner's extended relatives on his dad's side also reek of this booze odor.\n\nMany hardcore alcoholics roam around this neighborhood, I see them everyday. They and my partner's father help keep me sober. Thank you for the congratulations!\n\nIt isn't so loud here, and some day we will move when we earn more. It is inexpensive here and we are in a strategic location despite the booze. In time we'll get to where we are trying to go.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ismrqr/ive_been_sober_from_alcohol_for_over_6_years_now/g58steq/"}
