I deleted my facebook because my relatives that I cut contact with were messaging me on there. They still try to message my partner every so often. I was afraid of reaching out for years because of what I had left behind and what I had to lose. \nI only started learning how to really use reddit in the last 2 years or so. I made this account years ago but only used it to get critiques on our addiction course that we were working on at the time. \n\nI was mentally less stable, less able to reach out, more vulnerable and afraid of being found and harassed. It took years of stabilizing things here before I found the strength to reach out more. \n\nI still struggle to connect with people after I broke down ten years ago, I am trying to work through that more, in small steps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ismrqr/ive_been_sober_from_alcohol_for_over_6_years_now/g59nwxf/"}
