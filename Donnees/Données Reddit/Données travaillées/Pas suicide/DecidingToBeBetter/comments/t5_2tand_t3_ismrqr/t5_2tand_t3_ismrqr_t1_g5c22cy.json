People around here assume that we do nothing all day because we don't leave the house, it gets exhausting, the assumptions. \n\nOur struggles are invisible to people here, but the good thing is that we are mostly left alone when we are in our home. \n\nI am happy that I was able to help you renew your hope, it has been crazy, this life, but there is hope when you chase what matters most and your personal values. \n\nThank you for the congratulations!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ismrqr/ive_been_sober_from_alcohol_for_over_6_years_now/g5c22cy/"}
