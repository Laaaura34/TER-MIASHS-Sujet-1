Just unsubscribe or unfollow the stuff you reflexively watch or pay attention to. Replace it with new and interesting channels or subreddits. For example I replaced on YouTube politics channels with the ones that share great tips on how to be social and interesting in conversations and increase your charisma\n\nSimilarly on Reddit I follow subreddits like self improvement, deciding to be better etc that help me get introduced to ideas that I can experiment with to see if they help or not", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jkq35h/if_youre_going_to_reddit_cut_out_the_bad_subs/gakxn6b/"}
