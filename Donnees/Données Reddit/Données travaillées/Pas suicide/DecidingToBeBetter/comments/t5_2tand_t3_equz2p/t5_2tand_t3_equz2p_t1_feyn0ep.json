How did you proceed in prepping yourself to become the best version of yourself? \n\nI tried cutting out weed since years, some months of breaks, then strong drawbacks and now I wanted to take a step by step approach just like you said. \n\nAnother friend today challenged me to only smoke on sundays, and I cant even fucking form a strong \"YES!\" inside of me as response when I think about it.
