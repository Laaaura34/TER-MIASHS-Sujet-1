Losing a relationship is very difficult. You will mend in time and your heart will open to vulnerability again. The most important act to do during this time is to be gentle to yourself. If you allow for this, I am sure you will be able to trust and be close to people again.  \n\nAlso self inquiry is important. Why are you looking to form other relationships so soon anyway? Are you trying to avoid the pain from the loss you\u2019ve just experienced? I have found that it is helpful to truly feel the pain and confront your fears to then be able to emerge on the other side. Much love to you. Through struggle we build strength. You\u2019re not broken!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nihct9/the_thought_of_getting_close_to_someone_triggers/gz21myz/"}
