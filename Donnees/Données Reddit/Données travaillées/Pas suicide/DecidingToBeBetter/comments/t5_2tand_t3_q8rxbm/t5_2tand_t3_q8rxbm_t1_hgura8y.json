It's a creative tool and a flexible planner where I can put all my dreams, goals and resolutions so I can't forget and lose them. I also like to use it to remember the past and how much road I walked until now. I can plan my week and day and I can modify and adapt it according to my needs and current situation. Helps a lot in a daily basis and long run too. I tried to use normal planners many times but they didn't reflected all my needs and made me feel bad when I didn't use them for some times. Made me feel like a waste of money and paper. If I don't use my bullet journal I will just when I feel like it. There are many missing weeks and months in my journal, I'm ok with it, it represents difficult moment that I overcame.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8rxbm/how_can_i_be_more_enthusiastic_about_life/hgura8y/"}
