That's on the begining. Catch moments when you sit and do nothing, scrolling Internet and other things which serve to procrascination. \n\nAfter some time, for example after a month, besides observation, quickly do something other - leave facebook right then and fast sit to computer and write fairytale or anything you'd like to take care. Hold that at least 5 minutes without stopping the things you really want to do. But it's important to really want it and believe that you can. Build wanting and believing day by day. I did that, and as a consequence now I have a good job, good perspective, some skills :) \n\nStop believe that you don't have initiative. Start moving or your situation will become so bad that you will have to move, but then you won't have time to learn calmly. Fear will rule you and you'll regret that you haven't done your right things before. I know what I write. Start now, at least start thinking how to do well thing that you really want to move. And write down your ideas, even if they seem to be stupid.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8rxbm/how_can_i_be_more_enthusiastic_about_life/hh95qmv/"}
