And definitely encourage you to find what works best for you. And I assume those who you are working with can help you here as well.\n\nBut for me time is very important, so taking a frivolous (or sometimes industrious but off the path) break to do what I want is what does it. Usually these are things where I go unplug from connected technology\n\n- Write about my accomplishment in my pseudo journal\n- Write some prose about how I feel (definitely at least interesting to read back later)\n- Focus on one room or one area of my surroundings and make it nice and clean\n- Do that extra load of laundry for things you don't clean as frequently\n- Drive some place to take photos - or capture a photo about the accomplishment\n- Go on a hike\n- Research a vacation destination to put a goal in front of me\n- Just lounge in the sun or in a pool\n- Go on a scenic bike ride\n- Watch a movie that I already know really well but enjoy\n- Hack away on the arduino\n- Play video games and let the time go by\n\nIf I want to celebrate with others\n\n- Brunch\n- Try a new restaurant\n- Also go on a hike\n- Explain you are in a good mood about the day/week and ask a friend or friends what they want to do to maximize the positive vibes", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7pob7/after_years_of_being_depressed_and_suffering_from/grg78g6/"}
