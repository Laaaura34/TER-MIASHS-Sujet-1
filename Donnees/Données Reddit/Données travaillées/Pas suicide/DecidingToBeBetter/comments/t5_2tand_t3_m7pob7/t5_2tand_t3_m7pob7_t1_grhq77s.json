But I just want to say I\u2019m almost 23 but I\u2019m bout 8 months into therapy, I\u2019m off probation now, and I\u2019m looking at kicking you next ms.drugs. I can also really relate to the mother troubles. All I have to say from one trying man to another is things are getting better for us now, my therapy is government grant paid for  since my small towns make suicide rate is so high dead honest . If you care bout your self your loved ones will follow too with the same care. I\u2019m new to Reddit honestly from deleting fb and insta cuz scroll time waste, but any ways. Finding someone who gets it can at least be beneficial and all I can offer is words..sorry for the ramble lol", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7pob7/after_years_of_being_depressed_and_suffering_from/grhq77s/"}
