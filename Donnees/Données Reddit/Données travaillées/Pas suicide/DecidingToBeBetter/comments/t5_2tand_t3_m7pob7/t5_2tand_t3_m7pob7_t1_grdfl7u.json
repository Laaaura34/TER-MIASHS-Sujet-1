Going to therapy takes a lot of courage and self awareness, more than most of us have. As others have said, therapy is definitely a bumpy road - moments of elation, severe discomfort, pride, anger - but it\u2019s so, so worth it.\n\nTherapy is wonderful, but for some of my friends who have needed an extra nudge, medication has literally saved their life.
