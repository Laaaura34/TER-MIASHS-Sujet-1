I dont mean to come across as being a dick, I just see this is being a big issue if I were in your situation. I cant possibly think anyone, including my none psychic therapist and myself, can help me if I'm not first addressing the issue. \n\nAs for the cost, have you looked into anything free you may be able to receive, if you are eligible? I only ask because I came into this thinking of course you've got to pay, and it seemed that way through peers and such. I managed to find a place that asks for donations, payment isn't necessary. I need that right now as I'm unemployed, otherwise I wouldn't have gotten anywhere. \n\nChin up stranger, things can be better, I believe in you :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7pob7/after_years_of_being_depressed_and_suffering_from/grh2suo/"}
