I do believe that after a few weeks or so it'll be much easier. I am nervous that after awhile of not drinking I'll convince myself that I can learn to responsibly reincorporate it into my life. I've tried moderation and it's just not something I even need to consider anymore.\n\nAlso, I'm nervous to tell others because I've said it so many times and I don't really want to admit that it's out of control. The stigma concerns me. I'm working on deciding if/when/how to let people close to me know my new choice. But being able to express myself on this sub is helping a ton for now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/igf0f7/today_i_decided_to_be_done_with_alcohol_forever/g2uepf5/"}
