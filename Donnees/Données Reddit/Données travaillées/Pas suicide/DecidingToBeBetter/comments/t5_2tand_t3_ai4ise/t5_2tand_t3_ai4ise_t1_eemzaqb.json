There is a free book called The Blueprint. I've only made it a few pages in but it's helped me tremendously. It really makes you dig deep on uncomfortable questions about yourself. If it doesn't work for you it doesn't, but I was in a good rut for a few years and this helped along with having some deep conversations with an old friend. Having/finding someone in your life that is willing to put you on the spot and ask you real questions you don't want to talk about out loud will bring goals, strengths, and direction to the forefront.\n\n-Best of luck to you, cheers", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ai4ise/you_deserve_the_life_youve_always_wanted/eemzaqb/"}
