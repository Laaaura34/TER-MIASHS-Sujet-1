Thank you so much for posting this. My favorite things you said (not exact quotes) were that today is for sowing the seeds for tomorrow and that I need to prioritize my goals above all else because no one will do it for me. \n\nA great reminder that if I try to appease everyone else all the time (especially family), my goals will collect dust on the shelf and my resentments will just continue to get out of control. Thank you for motivating me and thousands of others! ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ai4ise/you_deserve_the_life_youve_always_wanted/eemnsx4/"}
