BUT you don't actually deserve anything. There is no magical force or karma that suggests you deserve anything. The bottom line you were trying to bring across is great but it's important to remind people that their lives are THEIR responsibility. They deserve nothing, as you said we are merely a drop in the ocean. There is no mystical force that decides if you deserve something or not - you need to do things for yourself. And you should. Not because you deserve it but because you can. And because you want to.   \n\n\nGreat post, and keep believing in yourself, people!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ai4ise/you_deserve_the_life_youve_always_wanted/eem4r7v/"}
