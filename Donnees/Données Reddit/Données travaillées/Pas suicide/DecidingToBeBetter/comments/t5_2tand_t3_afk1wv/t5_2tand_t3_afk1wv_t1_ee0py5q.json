In the past, I thought that berating myself and being harsh on myself was the solution to getting past my faults (procrastinating, not trying my best, etc). \n\nhowever, there was a big mental shift when I realized that the result of these thoughts is that I considered myself (my default) to be a lazy, stupid, unmotivated person. Therefore, the self-harshness becomes obvious. The solution then is to change the default picture of myself to someone who is motivated, who wants to work hard and do good work, who is just \"blocked\" by other things. \n\nWhen you have this default mindset, then improving oneself is a matter of focusing on solutions, not forcing a \"lazy\" person to work hard. I am a hard-working person who is being prevented by some things, whether those be intrusive, unproductive thoughts, a bad work environment, health issues, etc. \n\nThis shift was revelatory for me, but maintaining that belief, that I am \"good\" is still a work in progress. I've heard that daily affirmations should help with this, but have yet to give that a try...", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/afk1wv/how_to_be_kinder_to_yourself/ee0py5q/"}
