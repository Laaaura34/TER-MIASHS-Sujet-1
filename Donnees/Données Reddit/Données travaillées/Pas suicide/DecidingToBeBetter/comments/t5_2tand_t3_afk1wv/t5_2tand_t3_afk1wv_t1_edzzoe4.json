Don't make a commitment for the future, make a commitment now.\n\n\"There's so much wrong with me\" > \"There's so much I have to offer\"\n\n\nSee where I'm going with this? Now what I've done, was a standard \"fake it til you make it\". I would carry a notebook and anytime I had a negative conversation with myself, I'd write it down and visibly transform the conversation and force myself to think the way I wanted to.\n\nAfter enough time, it's less fake, and your internal dialogue becomes your biggest supporter. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/afk1wv/how_to_be_kinder_to_yourself/edzzoe4/"}
