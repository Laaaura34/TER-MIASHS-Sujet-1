If, no, when you fail, I want you to come back here and read this comment again. (I'm not trying to tell you that you won't succeed, but nobody is perfect, and you have to accept that there will be days where you go over a calorie limit, or you gain weight.)\n\nEveryone fails. It's human. Deciding to change is hard, and the first part of it is going to suck. But you aren't a failure just because you fail sometimes. One failed meal is just a reminder to do better. It's just a reminder telling you to keep going, until someday you will give in the last time. You won't know which fail is your last one, so all you can do is move on and strive to be better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gi3xgp/im_stopping_the_binge_eating/fqcorq6/"}
