The more this impulse is bottled up, the more unpredictable the outbursts are. This can be overly pronounced in young males given hormonal pressures\n\nYou need to find a healthy outlet for this aggression. Mine was lifting weights, sprinting, sports and video games. \n\nDon't live in a fantasy world where these impulses are not part of you as a human, and don't label them as bad. They come from our animal origins, and while they aren't hugely useful in the civilised world of today, they still need to be acknowledged and honoured, else they will surface without you controlling them", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/povfzq/just_wished_death_on_a_random_person_in_a/hd0isv7/"}
