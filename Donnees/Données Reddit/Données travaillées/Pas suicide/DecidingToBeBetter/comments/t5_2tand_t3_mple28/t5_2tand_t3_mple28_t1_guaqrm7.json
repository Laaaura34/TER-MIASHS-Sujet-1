I sometimes get flack from people in my life for looking for that romantic spark instead of just accepting \u201cis he nice? Did you two get along? Does he have a good job?\u201d\n\nI feel even if I did settle for \u201cgetting along\u201d instead of that actual romantic chemistry I would forever crave that magnetic experience... and what would happen if/when it does come? I don\u2019t want to use someone as my safety relationship just until someone I\u2019m more excited about comes along...\n\nGood on you for being honest with your date, and with yourself. Best of luck finding what you are looking for!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mple28/im_taking_charge_of_my_dating_life_by_not_taking/guaqrm7/"}
