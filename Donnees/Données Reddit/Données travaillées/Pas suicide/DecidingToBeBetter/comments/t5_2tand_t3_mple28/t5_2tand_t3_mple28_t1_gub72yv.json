I think it's definitely possible to know early on that things aren't headed in that direction. You can have a nice time with someone and enjoy a date without feeling anything romantic. I have been on a couple of dates where while they were perfectly nice I just didn't see things progressing. I was young and handled it poorly, but, I have learned and grown since then. Getting mixed messages is the worst. While it's always possible things will change in further dates, especially given how things like nerves or expectations can wreck havoc... You still generally get a feeling if there is enough there to make you want to continue and see if those feelings do develop. Be it enough things in common, similar sense of humor, etc. I've told people before that I'd rather that, even if what they told me really hurt than be ghosted. Left wondering what I did or said. It's happened to me multiple times. But, I basically got told that I just need to accept it because \"nobody owes me anything\". Including a conversation or answers. I still think it's a childish and hurtful way to handle a situation.
