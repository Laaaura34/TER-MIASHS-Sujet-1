When I was younger I would talk myself into getting into relationships with men that I wasn\u2019t very physically attracted to, just because I liked their personality etc. It never ended well, with time I inevitably stopped being attracted to them altogether and of course that wasn\u2019t fair to them... With my husband I was extremely physically attracted to him from the start... we\u2019ve been married for 5 years and when I see him I still feel like jumping his bones \ud83d\ude02 it feels good not to envy other couples because I find their mates are more attractive than mine. To me my husband is always the most attractive in the room. \ud83d\ude0d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mple28/im_taking_charge_of_my_dating_life_by_not_taking/guczuk3/"}
