I went on a date about a week back, and it was a pretty good time but I noticed a couple of red flags that told me things wouldn\u2019t quite work. Next morning I knew I really wasn\u2019t interested in a second date, so I just thanked her for her time and left it at that. But I didn\u2019t really make it clear that I didn\u2019t want a second date, so from that point of view I might be leading her on? Idk. I think she\u2019s on the same page as me anyway but it\u2019s smarter and more mature to be straight up about things", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mple28/im_taking_charge_of_my_dating_life_by_not_taking/guce1tg/"}
