I go to sleep quite late for a number of questions and the biggest one is when I get home I just lay in bed , go on my phone and it sometimes feels as if I cannot physically get out of bed and be productive. This goes on until I go shower then I would get a call from someone and be on the phone wasting more time until finally I am laying in bed again wanting to sleep but also wanting to get up and be productive.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nscr4a/i_dont_know_how_to_actually_be_better/h0lzlgh/"}
