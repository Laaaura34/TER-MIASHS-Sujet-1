That can be hard.  :(\n\nThen, your problems really seem to come back to your problems with sleep. You sleep too little(2am to 7 am is only 5 hrs! 7-8 hrs is appropriate!) And probably at the wrong time(for most people circadian rythm should make you tired at like 11pm already i think?). \nThat then leads to you being too tired to be disciplined and focused, and having a bad start into the day that makes ever getting started with good habits hard.\n\nIve heard a lot about how sleep deprivation is horrible for the brain, has a similar effect on memory and coordination as alcohol, and even makes people more impulsive(leading to bad decisions , procrastination, bad discipline).\n\nSo focus on fixing sleep! could you tell more about why exactly you go to sleep as late as 2 am?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nscr4a/i_dont_know_how_to_actually_be_better/h0lunlc/"}
