Popular notion isn't law in today's day and age. We live in an informed age. Sure, 20 years ago if a psychiatrists said \"oh, ya know we've done a lot of research, and there's absolutely NO in between of male vs. female.\" In that case, maybe you'd believe them because it was the mid 1980's and no body was informed about shit. Today, you don't have to take a psychiatrists word. It's like, do you think sexuality is binary? Do you think gender identity is binary? Do you think preference of chocolate vs. vanilla is binary? Do you believe in the autism SPECTRUM? I challenge you to come up with any trait which ISN'T a continuum. Its simple biology. Even something as simple as blue vs. brown eyes. Even if two people have blue eyes, they don't look EXACTLY the same. You can believe an old out dated model that lots of old shitty psychiatrists believe, or you can simply try *thinking* \n\n\n\"But the psychiatrist! they spend their whole lives studying human behaviors! You MUST believe the psychiatrists! They know all and have all of the answers!\" Never mind the fact that its possible the only reason they were interested in psychiatry in the first place is that they were bat-shit crazy to begin with.\n\nUse your own brain.
