I had always read you either are one or you aren't, and to talk of non-sociopaths as having similar traits of sociopaths is to confound the idea of a sociopath. \n\nIn other words, a single trait at any given moment (\"I really went for it that time, just focused and kept my eye on the prize, not like me at all!\") can be viewed as a moment of confidence and elan, or it can be seen as a \"sociopathic trait\" from some spectrum. I am not sure this is helpful for anyone.\n\nI'm also not sure it's helpful to simply demonize sociopaths/psychopaths and say they are \"inherently bad\" or a bane on society. They're still people and we as a society need to figure out how to deal with them and how they will affect us and we can affect them.\n\nDunno if this belongs here but those were my thoughts.
