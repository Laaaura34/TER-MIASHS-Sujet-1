Mostly because I don't hold it. \n\nLike all people, I think society could be better. But functional psychopaths running society is nothing new, and it's not merely a byproduct of current systems.\n\n**My aim is *understanding* why people in power are in power, not *justifying* it. I think this is important to understand because if you want to change society, you need to first know how power is created and maintained (at both an individual + group level).**\n\nFor example, I wonder how Bernie Sanders or Rand Paul would rank on the psychopathy scale. Though they are individuals who want to \"change society for the better\" - in their own different ways - they are also supremely focused, ambitious, non-conforming, and have the social skills and social charm to gain significant followers.\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/38b9wm/what_can_psychopaths_teach_us_about_success_we/cru464z/"}
