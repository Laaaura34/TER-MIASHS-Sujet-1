You are welcome to my suggestions below, but if you have  concerns about your ability to mentally process things you should probably also see a doctor or similar professional. \n\nHere are a few things to consider or aks yourself:\n\nHave you always felt this, or is it new/recent? \nDid it starting coincide with something, like starting college? \n\nThese things you get asked to do and forget. What are they? Who is asking, and why are they asking you? \n\nAre they important things that matter or are helping you with your studies, or are you getting roped into things which aren't actually necessary or helpful to you? \nAre these things you are forgetting things you actually want to do or be invoked in? \n\nAre you trying to take on more than is possible and you just keep misjudging how long things take or how busy you are? This happens with people who are constantly late too, they just can't or don't want to acknowledge how much time things take. \n\nAre you defintely forgetting to do things, or are you  procrastinating then not have enough time to do them?\n\nYou might find that if you are stressed, lots of change or fast paces activity burns you out. Your family could probably move boxes so quickly because for them it's a simple goal which is to move the boxes. If you are thinking about all the ramifications of where the boxes go, how you want things organised etc then its far more stressful for you. It also might be that not having control over things is stressing you out. \n\nMaybe check if you have any other symptoms of stress, anxiety or depression. \n\nRemember that your life, and your day should largely be under your destiny and decision making. Most of what you need to do each day you should be aware of and be wanting to do. You maybe don't like studying or working, but those things are means to accomplishing a bigger goal of graduating. Your focus should be on doing things which facilitate or somehow contribute to that one big goal - completing your studies successfully. You don't need to study all day, but you should avoid things which are going to be detrimental to your studies or distract you significantly.\n\nIf you feel like you are being pulled in 100 directions at once you need to consciously stop. Spend an hour thinking/writing down all the things going on and then start prioritising the important ones and then seriously add up how much time they require and try to understand how you should be spending your time\n\nIf things like bills, finance and admin are weighing you down you need to devote a bit of time to tackling them and  make them manageable. \n\nYou might want to subscribe to subreddits about minimalism, and how to say no. Small things like switching off alerts on your phone, unsubscribing from emails or signing out of social media can make a huge difference too.\n\nIn summary, check with a doctor there is no medical or psychological issue. And audit your life to see how much you are doing and what you need to be prioritising.\n\nSome people thrive with busy lives, some people operate best when things are simple, you need to find what works for you but don't expect your life and way of living to  just to 'work' straight out of the box. You need to design and craft a way of living which makes you feel productive and effective and that's what will make you feel able to cope and thrive.\n\nIf you let the world wash over you without a plan you will be blown all over the place like a leaf in a storm. You need to plant solid roots which fix you in place to acheive what's important to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phpmx3/i_dont_do_what_i_say_i_was_gonna_do_help/hbk5pal/"}
