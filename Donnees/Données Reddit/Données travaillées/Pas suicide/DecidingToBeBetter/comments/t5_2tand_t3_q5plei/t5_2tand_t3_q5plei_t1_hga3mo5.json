I love that your mom was so happy...and congrats on getting sober...you have a new life to live & I am sure seeing you not suffer under the weight ( pun not intended \ud83d\ude09) of an addiction...that is desperately hard to watch anyone go through...especially your child...\n\nI gift you a reddit silver coin for amazing accomplishments! Remember always stay diligent in your sobriety...i have seen many people with 15 to 20 years clean under their belts & after so manyyears...you let your guard down..or stop working on your issues & growing...just like reaching your ideal weight takes maintenance after you reach your goal...so does your sobriety...\n\nI hope you are as proud of yourself as your mom is of you!!!\n\n\ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5plei/last_week_i_made_my_mum_cry/hga3mo5/"}
