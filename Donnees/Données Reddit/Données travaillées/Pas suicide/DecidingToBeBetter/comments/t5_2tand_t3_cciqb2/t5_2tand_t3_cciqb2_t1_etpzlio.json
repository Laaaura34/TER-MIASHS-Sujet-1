It's hard for me to let go, maybe I need to change the way of thinking about her. Will try.\n\nIt's awkward at first, so better find something you really like or want to do, and speak about it, but mostly listen.  With some girls, i talked tarot and occult (real interest of mine) but mostly it was about working out and dieting (I was technically morbidly obese, now I'm at the brink of not being overweight, so was doing it for myself). Play dumb, ask advice, change subjects mid sentence (people don't notice or don't care), ask about dreams, plans, etc. Extend relationships a bit at a time. Better talk not enough than too much, not to seem needy. Good luck :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cciqb2/today_i_did_something_that_felt_really_good_for/etpzlio/"}
