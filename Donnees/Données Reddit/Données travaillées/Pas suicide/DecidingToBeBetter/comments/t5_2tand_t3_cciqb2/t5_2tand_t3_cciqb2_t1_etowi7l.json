But fairly recently (in my not depressed state) I had a conversation about my past/ present life with my teacher which was super depressing. I made my teacher feel sad I think which made me a bit sad.\n\nHe gave me some advise and I left, I missed the bus bc I talked to my teacher so I walked home.\n\nI wear glasses, it started raining and I wore a fleece jacket or something like that Idk how to say call it in neither my native language nor English, a hoodie?\n\nSo naturally when it\u2018s raining and you have a hoodie and you use the hoods while looking down to keep your glasses dry.\nMaybe I looked a bit sad too.\n\nSome random Woman I didn\u2019t know sad hi to me in the middle of the crosswalk.\n\nI looked back and she quickly went to my side of the street, the light was still green.\n\nShe told me how I looked similar to her dead brother and that everything will be ok. And that it\u2018s ok to be who I am.\n\nI think this brother thing was a lie but she tried to be nice to me a seemingly depressed person. <Tears in my eyes rn>\nVery nice person. Was interesting to meet her, I probably won\u2019t forget her ever. \n\nI don\u2019t believe in God but this is the closest I ever got to him.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cciqb2/today_i_did_something_that_felt_really_good_for/etowi7l/"}
