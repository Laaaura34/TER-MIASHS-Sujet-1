That really helps me out. I also noticed in college, rather than high school, the information in the textbook is *really* interesting sometimes. For example, in my Anthropology class, I learned that years before the Jamestown Massacre, a drought caused the people to dig up old bodies and eat their brains/organs to survive as they literally had no food. Repulsive, yes, but I would've never known that cool fact without reading. Try to find some positives in learning something new that you can spread to other people!
