You know that you have a happiness threshold too right? Break that next!! I\u2019m BI Polar and suffer from Severe PTSD, and I have been diagnosed with 2 autoimmune disorders which are terminal. I totally resonate with your journey. I also make my way out of depression and sometimes slip back a little, but after breaking my happiness threshold, quite by accident, I realized that I am just hitting the \u201ctip of the iceberg \u201c of my abilities. Mine is out of fear of failure or success, or both maybe. Every time I hold back from something I ask myself if it\u2019s out of fear, if the answer is yes then......I have to take my fear with me, I cannot allow it to stop me. \n\nYou are all powerful, remember that!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cyjmw3/my_mental_health_journey/eytkko4/"}
