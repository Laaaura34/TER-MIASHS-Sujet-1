I chose my path right before I graduated from college (back in August) and definitely don't have the same experience my peers did. They've already landed jobs. They've won awards for content they've put out. They already have some type of presence out there. I let my fear hold me back in college, and now I'm letting it hold myself back now. I said I was taking time off from searching to get my life together, but now it's four months later and I feel I'm still stuck in the same spot. I'm getting comfortable and I've been afraid to move forward.\n\nThank you for sharing your story. Congratulations, you're doing amazing. You're inspiring honestly!
