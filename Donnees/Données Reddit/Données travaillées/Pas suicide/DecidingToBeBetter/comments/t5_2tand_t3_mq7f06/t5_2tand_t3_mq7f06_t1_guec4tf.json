I struggled with social anxiety and depression most of my life. What I realized is that loving ourselves is having discipline. A great technique I have been using is just giving myself advice as if I am looking from the outside in. If someone came to you with all the problems you listed above what type of advice would you give them? Another thing to keep in mind is that we all technically have nothing to lose by talking to people. I was always scared to talk to particular people, but sometimes you might never see these people ever again. They aren't gonna kill you. There is this thing called the 5 year rule. Ask yourself is what I am about to do gonna matter in 5 years? Depending on your answer do so accordingly. Depression and anxiety are caused by our fixation on the past and our worries of the future. This present moment is both the past and future. So why not just take advantage of the present moment by working on yourself. The only way to fill the void is by filling it with yourself. Your thoughts, actions, and words are ways of showing if you love or hate yourself. Anyways goodluck!
