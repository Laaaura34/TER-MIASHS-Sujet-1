I also have stopped drinking (hopefully forever), paid off my car, got a raise, and improved my marriage.  I didn\u2019t lose 25 pounds because I had a baby during this time, but I think that makes the weight gain worth it. \n\nThis year has been transformative, despite being total a shitstorm.  \n\nI\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019m walking out of 2020 a much better version of myself.   I\u2019m also proud of you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kl6d2d/2020_quit_drinking_lost_weight_paid_off_car/gh8hqkv/"}
