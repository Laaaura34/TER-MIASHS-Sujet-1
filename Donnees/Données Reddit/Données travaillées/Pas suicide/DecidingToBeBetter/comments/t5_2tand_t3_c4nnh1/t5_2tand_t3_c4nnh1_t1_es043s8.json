I learnt this the hard way and I would rather you not \"fall from grace\" either\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm will be sober 3 years in August, but it took me 5 years to achieve it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI allowed myself to get a little too excited in the early days and feel \"fixed/cured\" or like a new me had emerged.  By the way all this did eventually happen but I rushed into congratulating myself. 50 days is alot but dont get to excited, its nothing in the grand scheme of things\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason Im warning you is, we (addicts) like to give ourselves reasons to celebrate. And it could occur that might convince yourself you have \"beaten\" alcohol and now this new you would have a whole new outlook on life\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis bubble of joy your experiencing right now, are you stable enough to survive a crash of some sort, getting bad news or losing your job etc (just an example) - after 50 days i would suggest your not. \n\n  \nBe humble in your sobriety, protect it, keep doing what your doing but dont get to carried away with your journey just yet.  I found it took me over 2 years but fully feel safe to even be around alcohol and not feel an urge\n\n  \nI only want you to be aware of how delicate it is what your feeling. Yes its a great achivement but dont let your ego get to excited, we have funny ways of allowing ourselves to F it all up again...i know ive done it", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c4nnh1/my_50th_morning_sober/es043s8/"}
