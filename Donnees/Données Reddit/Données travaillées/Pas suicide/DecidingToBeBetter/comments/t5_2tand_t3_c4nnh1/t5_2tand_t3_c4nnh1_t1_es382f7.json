I have been sober for a few years, but I am still working at bettering myself. You are truly an inspiration to me. Thank you for sharing. \n\nI also understand about no one knowing that you were ever not sober. When I get close enough to people to tell them about my past, most can\u2019t believe I was ever different. I felt what you meant by \u201cwarm blanket.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve got this!!!!
