I recommend reading \"the easy way to quit smoking\".  It's a quick read that made all the difference for me.  I read the book while using nicotine, and quit at the end.  Only took like 2 hours to read.  I haven't used nicotine in like a year and a half, and I never have cravings.\n\nOne thing I want you to remember is that its actually not *that* hard to quit smoking.  You'll have cravings, maybe headaches, and maybe irritable, but it's no worse than getting the flu.\n\nSavor the cravings and the temptations, because each time you say no to them is one less time you will have to do that.  It gets easier to say no to them, and eventually you stop having them all together.\n\nWelcome to the world of not being nicotine's bitch!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf2j8a/smoking_my_last_cigarette_today_excited_to_wake/gslnnh9/"}
