When I originally quit that was a big issue for me, I\u2019d have a few drinks, cave and have a cigarette and I\u2019d immediately feel like I failed and would start smoking again. Finally, I began chewing gum, using sprays as a replacement for cigarettes, and I gradually cut down on smoking. I hated the gum so it was almost an incentive for me to get through it so I didn\u2019t have to chew it anymore. I knew if I didn\u2019t keep the mindset that one slip up was the end that I\u2019d be able to quit and I can say ten years later I no longer have any urge to light a cigarette anymore.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf2j8a/smoking_my_last_cigarette_today_excited_to_wake/gslayho/"}
