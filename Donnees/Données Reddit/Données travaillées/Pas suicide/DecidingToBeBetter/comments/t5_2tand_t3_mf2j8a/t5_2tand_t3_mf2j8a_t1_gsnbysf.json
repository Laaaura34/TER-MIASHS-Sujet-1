But I was reading Alan Carr's book the easy way to quit, and it helped me to visualize the nicotine monster. ( I visualized something like the Mucinex monster - haha) When the cravings got bad I would visualize beating the nicotine monster, torture if necessary. Ball bats, hot pincers, whatever it took. The cravings hit? I hit back with a ball bat. I would visualize beating the nicotine beast. Eventually the cravings lessened and here I am 6 years later, nicotine free. I will never go back. You can beat it too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf2j8a/smoking_my_last_cigarette_today_excited_to_wake/gsnbysf/"}
