I did it mainly to save money, but also because smoking tends to piss people off around me.  I also quit drugs around the same time, and my best advice would be, if you find it too difficult and too much pressure to quit, maybe try this route.  My lung functions are immaculate after smoking for around the same amount of time, but I still get to enjoy the pacification of the quick nicotine fix (which I'm ok with tbh, since nicotine is really the least bad thing about the contents of cigarette smoke), and I no longer have any cough or any smoking related hinderances in my life.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, this is just what I did, and I'm guilty of having a cig every now and then (maybe 5-10 a year maximum) , but they actually are disgusting and ineffective to me now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf2j8a/smoking_my_last_cigarette_today_excited_to_wake/gsoxg10/"}
