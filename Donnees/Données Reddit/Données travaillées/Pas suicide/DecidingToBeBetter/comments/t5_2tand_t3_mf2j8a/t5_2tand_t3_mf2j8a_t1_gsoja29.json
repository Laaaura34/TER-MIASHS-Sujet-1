I suggest getting a cheap vape and putting it in your glove box if you're ever feeling like you really can't take it. Cold turkey is hard, and there's no shame in weaning yourself off bit by bit. I went from a pack and a half a day, to cold turkey, then to hitting a vape a few times a day. Luckily I got on medication that helps out with it but it's important to find what works for you. Also, drinking can make it 10x harder to say no to some nic; if you have a drinking buddy, let them know you're quitting and to help you say no when you're inebriated.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf2j8a/smoking_my_last_cigarette_today_excited_to_wake/gsoja29/"}
