It has surprised me that I never even think about smoking anymore. Even if I am blackout drunk, it does not even occur to me to smoke a cigarette. Not only do I never want a cigarette, I don't even notice cigarettes exist unless I see someone smoking. I smoked for twenty years, and it seems like that was a different life now because I feel like I am so far removed from it. I couldn't imagine living that way now. Everything smelled like smoke, my car, my clothes, etc. Gross. I left that life behind me, and I feel so much better now. I think I probably have some permanent damage, for example I wheeze a bit when I breathe sometimes. But I would be so much worse off if I had continued. Stop now. You will thank yourself for it later. Eventually you will wonder why you did it at all in the first place.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf2j8a/smoking_my_last_cigarette_today_excited_to_wake/gsm5v4z/"}
