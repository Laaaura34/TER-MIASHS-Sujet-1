I was the type who loved smoking like really loved it. I was smoking at least a pack a day and going out in the rain, in the cold, sitting in gross lit glass boxes at the airport...whatever it took. And now I fucking love not smoking!\n\nI told myself that smoking calmed me down or that it helped my anxiety. Total lie. I realized after I quit that it was the cause of so much anxiety. I spent so much time at work or in class thinking about how much longer until I can smoke. Flying across the country was like a withdrawal nightmare. Trying to hide the smell around certain family members (and failing terribly...I didn't realize until I quit how awful I must have smelled for years). \n\nFocus on the upsides.
