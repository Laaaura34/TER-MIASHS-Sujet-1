Focus on the positives, ignore the negatives (as much as possible).  There are a couple of good apps out there, I think SinceIQuit is the one I used, you can put your quit date and amount smoked per day in, it'll show you savings since you quit, plus health milestones (like, your sense of taste has returned, your risk of sudden heart attack is now cut in half, etc).  Those really helped me the first time, when I was having a terrible craving I could pop the app open and remind myself.  Sometimes I take a drive around with the windows down and just smell all the things I couldn't smell before.  Asphalt, oak trees, rain.  There are great smells all around but I could rarely detect them before.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf2j8a/smoking_my_last_cigarette_today_excited_to_wake/gsl6pco/"}
