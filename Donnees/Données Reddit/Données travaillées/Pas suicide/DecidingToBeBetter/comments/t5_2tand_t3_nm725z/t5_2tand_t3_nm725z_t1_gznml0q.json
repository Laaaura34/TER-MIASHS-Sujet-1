ONE BITE AT A TIME.\"\n\nIt feels like an elephant of a problem but start today and do one little thing for yourself. Apply to one job  lose enough to home and flexible enough to let you take care of folks.\n\nMentally: you're not alone. It gets better.\n\nMental HEALTH: ADHD is treatable. Get with your psychiatrist and get diagnosed and treated. From personal experience, watch your white lies. You put pressure on yourself by lying (even if it's to save their feelings). \n\nPhysically: get active. Even if it's a 30 minute daily walk. This is literally injecting happy chemicals into your brain. Mood and perspective changes everything.\n\nSocially: you've got a great support system. Keep building it, and reach out to friends. Friends help distract from bad situations. \n\nFinancially: it's not how much you make, but what you do with it. Eat well. Eat frugally. Don't go to restaurants and quit drinking if it's an expensive habit.\n\nBest advice i can give is do your best to maintain positivity, take one bite at a time and lean on your friends. Give yourself patience, grace, love.\n\nHang in there. Sending you positivity from the universe.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nm725z/i_need_to_get_my_life_back_on_track_i_dropped_out/gznml0q/"}
