Nature and the outdoors is stimulating, energizing, and uplifting, which in turn can be motivating. After a while, stand up and take a walk. Look around. Walking/movement will get more blood and oxygen flowing into your brain and all organs and will release a little serotonin (feel good hormone), and you\u2019ll think and feel better. After spending a couple of hours or so sitting around doing nothing outside, and taking a walk if you can, you\u2019ll come inside feeling like doing something, anything, like brushing your teeth, washing dishes, taking a shower or warm bath. After you\u2019ve done at least one constructive activity, you\u2019ll feel better and like doing more. Let nature outdoors give you the incentive you need, to live healthily. Go outside and listen to the sounds of nature, breathe fresh air, and look around and up at the sky every day. It\u2019ll help you feel connected to life again and to something greater.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nwf5vh/hygiene_tips_for_when_youre_at_your_lowest/h19rl0o/"}
