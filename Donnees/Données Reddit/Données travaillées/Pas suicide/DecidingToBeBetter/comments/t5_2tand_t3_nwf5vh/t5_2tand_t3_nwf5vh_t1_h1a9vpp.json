I roll it up with a non-allergenic dryer wipe and hide them around. One in my backpack, in my bookshelf, in a drawer in my bathroom, etc. It's because when I'm depressed laundry becomes impossible and having clean underwear even if I can't shower makes a big mental difference.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nwf5vh/hygiene_tips_for_when_youre_at_your_lowest/h1a9vpp/"}
