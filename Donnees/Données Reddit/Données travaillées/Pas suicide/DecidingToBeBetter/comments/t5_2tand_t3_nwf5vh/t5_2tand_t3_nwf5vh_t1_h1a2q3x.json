As someone who is a pro at mentally beating myself up, it is so encouraging to know that other people struggle with this too. And that not being able to take care of basic things is legitimate, and not just being lazy. Also, my best friend has chronic pain, and so she can\u2019t do a lot of things as well. But I have also thought her reasoning was so much more legitimate than mine, because she physically can\u2019t exert herself to do a \u201cnormal\u201d amount of work. So I should be able to do all that right? Because there is nothing physically wrong with me? But it\u2019s ok to not be able to do everything.
