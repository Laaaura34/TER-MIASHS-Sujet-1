She cheated on me. I lost my high paying job I loved and was at for a decade and planned on staying there until retirement. Two years ago. My dad also died two years ago. I became an alcoholic. Gained 150 pounds. Ive been unemployed, and alone for two years. I never shower. Never brush my teeth or shave. Never leave my bed. Garbage around the bed. I lay in one spot all day and do nothing. NEVER leave the house. No friends. And for some reason\u2026 I feel less depressed than I ever have in my life. I\u2019m TOTALLY content. Like full monk mode. I honestly do not give a shit, and I\u2019m totally okay with that. Not sure why, but I felt like sharing that. I guess what I\u2019m saying is, depression (for me) has absolutely no correlation with any of these factors. I feel way less depressed and upset now that I have zero expectations of myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nwf5vh/hygiene_tips_for_when_youre_at_your_lowest/h19n9lu/"}
