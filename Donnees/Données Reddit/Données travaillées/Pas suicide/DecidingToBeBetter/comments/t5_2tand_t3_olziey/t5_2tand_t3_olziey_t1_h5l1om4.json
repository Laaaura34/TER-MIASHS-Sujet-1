What makes you happy? Do it. What makes your children happy? Do it. Every day, wake up and ask yourself: \u201cwhat will make me happy?\u201d Don\u2019t allow your ideas to have anything to do with your partner. And then follow through on whatever pops in your brain. Some your ideas will be a bust, some will okay, some will be amazing. Try them all. Allow yourself to be busy with the task of making yourself happy.\n\nFor example. What makes me happy is stretching. So I stretch. Got a stretch coach and everything. Even when everyone was like \u201cthat\u2019s dumb and expensive\u201d. I did it anyway. I look forward to it all week. I also go and have an amazing lunch all by myself at the vegan restaurant right next door, afterwards, to celebrate my good time stretching! Haha.\n\nSeems simple, maybe silly, but the idea is to focus on yourself, focus on your children, seek good things that make you feel good. That\u2019s it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/olziey/tips_on_how_to_live_life_while_waiting_for_your/h5l1om4/"}
