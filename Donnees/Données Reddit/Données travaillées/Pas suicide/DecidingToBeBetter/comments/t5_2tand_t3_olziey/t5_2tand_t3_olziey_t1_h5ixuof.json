I\u2019m sure you get heartfelt apologies, and maybe even see \u201cprogress\u201d for a couple weeks, or a month or two, before he \u201cslips up\u201d again and the cycle starts fresh with his emotional apologies and promises to try harder. But if he were really trying you wouldn\u2019t still be having these problems. \n\nTo be frank, it\u2019s not hard to not cheat in a relationship. It\u2019s actually incredibly easy not to cheat. All you have to do is not flirt with other people. You say \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m already in a relationship,\u201d if someone offers you their number or asks you to come home with them. If the temptation is a struggle then just go home and go back out another time when you\u2019re in a better headspace. Your boyfriend isn\u2019t doing any of these *very* simple things. And just because you\u2019re not a peach 100% of the time doesn\u2019t mean his cheating is excusable or forgivable. If you don\u2019t like how someone is treating you you either leave them or draw a hard boundary within the relationship. He\u2019s taking advantage of all of your compassion and loyalty, and with this long and ongoing of a precedent being set I think the only way to get him to stop taking advantage of you is to leave. \n\nYou say that he\u2019s genuinely sorry, but if he were *genuinely* sorry he would have stopped this disgusting and degrading behavior. He\u2019s only sorry that he got caught. He has so little respect for you that he tries to cheat with people that he *knows* will probably tell you, but he does it anyways because he knows you\u2019ll forgive him anyways. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard to believe that you will be able to love anyone else as much as you love this person you\u2019ve spent 9 years with, but once you\u2019re with someone who is fiercely loyal to you I promise your heart is going to swell with so much love and gratefulness that you\u2019ll wonder why you put up with this guy for so long. I spent years stuck in cycles of dating serial cheaters, and also dating serial abusers, and I know that leaving is the hardest part but life is so, so much more fulfilling and rewarding once you finally do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/olziey/tips_on_how_to_live_life_while_waiting_for_your/h5ixuof/"}
