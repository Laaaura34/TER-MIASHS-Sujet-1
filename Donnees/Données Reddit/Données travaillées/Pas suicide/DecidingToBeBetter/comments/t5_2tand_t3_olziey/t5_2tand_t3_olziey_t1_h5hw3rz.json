But 9 years has shown evidence otherwise. You can either give it another 9 years of hoping he'll change until you realize that he isn't, but by then you'll be almost 40. You're still only late 20's. If I was you, I'd cut my losses. You're holding onto the sunk costs. You've already invested 9 years of your life. You're not getting it back. But don't waste another 9 years of your life for a fruitless endeavour. If he doesn't want to be faithful, he won't, and I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up leaving you for someone else in the future since he doesn't want to be monogamous.\n\nIf you really want to give him another chance, do so. But make it a final chance. Something like \"If you ever try it on with anyone else, at any time, that's the end of us, and I'm leaving\". But the most important thing is that you follow through.\n\nI understand you've probably given up more than time, so now is the time to start considering the possibility that you will have to leave, so prepare accordingly.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/olziey/tips_on_how_to_live_life_while_waiting_for_your/h5hw3rz/"}
