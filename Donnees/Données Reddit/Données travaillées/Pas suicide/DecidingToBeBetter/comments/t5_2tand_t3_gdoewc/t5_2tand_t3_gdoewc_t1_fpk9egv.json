In reality, by doing nothing you\u2019re digging yourself further down a hole and you\u2019ll run out of time. \n\nNow i\u2019m my opinion, what you could say is that your present self is lacking drive and motivation and it\u2019s just been like that for a while. Yes everyone has up and down points, attitudes and perspectives in their lives but i\u2019d be focusing on the present man. The present defines all of that shit anyway, so LIVE. I think you\u2019re spending too much time being upset and down about what you\u2019ve accomplished and what you want to do that you simply aren\u2019t doing any of those things because you feel that it\u2019s too late or that you\u2019ll be like this forever.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gdoewc/my_life_has_been_wasted_current_times_have_only/fpk9egv/"}
