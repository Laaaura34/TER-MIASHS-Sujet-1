Do not be paralyzed by anxiety, pain depression and fear. Your therapist is right; you need to allow yourself to be uncomfortable, allow yourself to experience pain, possibly disappointment and failure in order to know what it is you\u2019re doing incorrectly so you can modify yourself and do what\u2019s correct to achieve the goals you set for yourself. \n\nI feel you with the jobs too man. For the longest I didn\u2019t even make a resume because I barely had shit to put on it. No real job experience. No internship yet. I hated that I didn\u2019t have that under my belt so much that I sat, thought about it realized I had more experience than I thought and created one some time ago. Nah I haven\u2019t gotten any interviews yet but I sure did fucking apply. And i\u2019m gonna keep applying until something pulls through. Not every shot is gonna make it but you have to keep modifying and shooting until you land some. \n\nIt\u2019s life man, stop being hard on yourself and start changing for the better. Do not. Stay. Stagnant. Move forward.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gdoewc/my_life_has_been_wasted_current_times_have_only/fpmipov/"}
