A large part of not accomplishing the things we want and saying that we\u2019ll never accomplish them only comes from you focusing on what you perceive to be \u201cnormal\u201d and that you\u2019re behind. You are not behind. Sure you may not be where you want to be but all of that can be changed. It requires a shift in your perspective.\n\nWhich leads me to my next question.\n\nWhat does down talking yourself and convincing yourself that you\u2019re pathetic doing for your situation? How is it helping? We ALL feel we aren\u2019t doing enough and yeah it sucks, I know how it feels. What i\u2019ll say is that the longer you hone in on what you haven\u2019t done and where you aren\u2019t at, versus what you can do and where you want to be, you\u2019ll never be the you version of the self you want to achieve. \n\nI feel the same as you man, I\u2019ll be 23 in June and I\u2019ve never had a \u201creal\u201d job. I\u2019ve worked at my college, doordash, uber, really smooth shit you know? Although im 4 classes away, I dont have my degree yet so i\u2019ve done nothing professional and I feel bad because others around me that are my colleagues, friends, same age. Have majorly gotten their degrees and are into jobs already. But guess what? Focusing on them will not help me, All I can do it focus on my degree during this pandemic and keep applying for work until something pulls through.\n\nIt\u2019s all about perspective man, go fucking tunnel vision for yourself. FOCUS. It\u2019s hard hell yeah but you only fail when you\u2019ve accepted failure and you\u2019ve stopped trying.
