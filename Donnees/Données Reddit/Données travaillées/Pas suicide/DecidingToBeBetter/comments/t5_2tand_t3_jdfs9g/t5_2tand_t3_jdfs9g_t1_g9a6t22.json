I fold laundry while sitting on a specific chair that is the right height for me to lift laundry that I placed on the arm of our couch. I lift it, fold it in my arms and place it on an ottoman at a convenient height beside me. I have two ottomans for either two different people or linen closet. Extra items left to the side. Once one pile has 10 items I take it to the room it belongs in. Then the ottoman poles can change based on whose clothes or what items are left.\n\nAnd I never sit to long to seize up my tired sore back.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jdfs9g/if_you_do_your_tasks_when_you_get_home/g9a6t22/"}
