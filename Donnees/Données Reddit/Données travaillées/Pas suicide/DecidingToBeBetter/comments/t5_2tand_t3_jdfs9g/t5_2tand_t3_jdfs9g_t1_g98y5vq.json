You either need to become more efficient with your afterwork tasks or change the schedule up. I see a maximum of 2 working hours (including cooking) as the after work schedule. I get home at 6pm and I go to bed at 10. If I spent 4 hours working after I spent 8+ hours AT WORK, I'd literally never do anything I want during the week and I'd be extremely exhausted. Life is meant for enjoyment, not for a constant rinse and repeat cycle...which I'll admit is inevitable for certain things", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jdfs9g/if_you_do_your_tasks_when_you_get_home/g98y5vq/"}
