I've always been that way.\n\nI get my stuff done, but if my parents understood this was a possible brain makeup, they would have allowed me to have 30 mins of TV time and a snack after school before doing my hours of homework. But since it was such a strict rule in my house growing up that you get no playtime until all your homework is done and your room is clean, I adapted the habit of lying that I had no homework and then literally just never doing it. I somehow graduated with a 2.7 GPA. I managed to never actually fail a class because I cram for tests well but I got very, very close many times and it didn't have to be that way.\n\nNot to be an ass, but this is the wrong sub for this tip because, while I agree it's very helpful to probably many people, it doesn't make anyone better to not take a break.\n\nNormalize taking breaks, but advocate for *structured* breaks.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jdfs9g/if_you_do_your_tasks_when_you_get_home/g9acjd8/"}
