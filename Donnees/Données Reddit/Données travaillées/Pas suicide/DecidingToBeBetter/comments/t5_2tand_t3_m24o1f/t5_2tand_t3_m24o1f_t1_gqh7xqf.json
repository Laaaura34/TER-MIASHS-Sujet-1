Everyone has their own struggle, and I encourage you to get tested if you think it will help.\n\nDo you like working in manufacturing? Maybe you could take some engineering/supply chain-type classes at a local community college to see if that could be a career path for you.\n\nAlternatively, you could apprentice and learn a trade. Community colleges could help with this too, depending on the ones near you. This would provide a (hopefully) meaningful career path that could ultimately lead to you working for yourself, being your own boss.\n\nRegardless of if you're tired, *try* to get into at least one hobby. Coming home and being drained sucks, but if you actually get going with something you like (it could even just be something as simple as reading or journaling) then it could energize you due to your interest in it. Just 30 minutes a day on a hobby or skill yields great improvements over time.\n\nHope this helps, hang in there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m24o1f/im_24_and_i_feel_like_i_have_failed_at_life/gqh7xqf/"}
