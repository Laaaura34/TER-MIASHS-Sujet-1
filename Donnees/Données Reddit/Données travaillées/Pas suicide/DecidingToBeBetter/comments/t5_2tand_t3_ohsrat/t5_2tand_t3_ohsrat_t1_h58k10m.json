To keep it short, really think about, and internalize, the fact that you're going to die one day. One day, all there will be left to do is lie on your death bed and reflect on your already-lived life. For me personally, I absolutely dread reflecting on my life with regret. As a result, it makes it easier for me to take (healthy, calculated) risks, to live life the way I want, and completely removes any fear I have of 'going for it.' (What also helps is living in the moment. Every day (well, almost every day) is rich beyond belief, all you have to do is pay attention. Pay attention to the birds in the sky, the squirrels in the trees, the texture of food in your mouth, think back and reflect on your best memories, think of the things you're grateful for in that moment, pretend that whatever you're experiencing in the present moment--food, water, a bike ride, petting your cat, etc--that it will be the last time you experience it.)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ohsrat/ive_decided_im_gonna_start_living/h58k10m/"}
