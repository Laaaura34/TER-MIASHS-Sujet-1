Sometimes doing things to help others can help us get out of this rut. I\u2019ve behaved in similar ways in the past and come to realise even tho it\u2019s acting out of self hatred it\u2019s actually very selfish and narcissistic to act like this. I had to make a conscious decision to behave better. And remember that each day is a new opportunity to behave in a good way. One thing I like doing is helping other people on Reddit and fb , by giving advice / supportive comments so maybe that\u2019s an easy first thing for you to try ? Also I find going for walks every day really helps regulate my emotions, and keeping my sleep regular. \nAlso lots of tv shows explore these sorts of bahviours so that might be helpful too. Examples include bojack horseman, after life , fleabag , Russian doll, the good place. \nGood luck, keep trying, it will take time but it will be worth it !!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/muhg8l/ive_burned_bridges_with_people_who_care_deeply/gv6mp81/"}
