It sounds like you\u2019re going through a lot and you\u2019re experiencing a good deal of pain as well as passing that harm onto others.\n\nSince you mentioned more serious concerns like alcohol abuse and self harm, I recommend you seek professional support. I\u2019ve been inpatient before (for other reasons) and a good deal of my friends have been through rehab or therapy or some combination of all of the above. You need medical, professional, and multi-person support. You need community. You need to share intentions to stop this behavior and ask for help from people in your circle as well.\n\nWe can\u2019t change deep habits alone. We require the support and help of others and this is a beautiful part of life, not a weakness. \n\nWhile taking some time off the computer and other things may help, as a total stranger it sounds like you need support for working through self hatred which has spilled over into self harm through alcohol and cutting plus harming relationships to push others away. \n\nReally good luck to you. You\u2019re incredibly self aware which is a very hard thing to achieve.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/muhg8l/ive_burned_bridges_with_people_who_care_deeply/gv63cb7/"}
