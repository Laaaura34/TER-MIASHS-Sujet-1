If you manage to do this, it will rrquire very little willpower, but getting to that point is hard.\"The Power of Habits\" and \"Atomic Habits\"  are two very good books on this, and atomic habits has an audiobook reading on spotify i listened to\n\nMake those habits easy to follow.\n E.g. If you want to study , set small reachable goals at first(literally 10min of studying to start if you want)and build up from there\nSet up your environment so there are few distractions, go to a library for example. Can't procrastinate if there isnt anything to do but study.\nEtc.\n\nReward yourself for following the habit. If you eat a piece of chocolate everytime you do 20 push ups,  ypur brain will start to associate the workout with chocolate.\n\n\nTLDR: if you dont have motivation,  you need to structure your goals so that they dont need much motivation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mi3a63/i_want_to_be_more_disciplined_just_maybe_not_as/gt2puh3/"}
