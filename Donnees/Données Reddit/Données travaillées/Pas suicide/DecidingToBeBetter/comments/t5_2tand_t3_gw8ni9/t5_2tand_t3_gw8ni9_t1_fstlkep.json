It sounds fun and exciting to start adding many things into your life at once because you have time, but that's setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\n\nAdd one thing, try it out. If it works out, keep doing it for a few weeks or even a month before trying to add something else. Somethings synergize quite well, like diet and exercise, so doing those both at the same time are actually more valuable than the two separate parts.\n\n\nOne last thing, I've been reading and listening to a bunch of stuff on things to implement into your life to improve your state of mind and being. The three things that are work well together are work, diet, and exercise. If you can get some productivity in with your diet and exercise, you'll be feeling pretty good. I can vouch for those things because this is the program I've been following for the last few weeks and it's been working wondrously. Also, if I choose to, I still have about 6 hours of time to do whatever I want afterwards.\n\n\nBest of luck! Enjoy your break and congrats on the new job. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gw8ni9/the_start_date_for_my_first_job_out_of_college/fstlkep/"}
