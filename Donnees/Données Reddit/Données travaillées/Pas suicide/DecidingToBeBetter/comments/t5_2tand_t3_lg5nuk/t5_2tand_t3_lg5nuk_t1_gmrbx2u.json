I was SO excited and so happy to be there no matter how mundane or meaningless the work seems (retail). The amount of complaining and apathy some of my coworkers had was appalling. Especially KNOWING how there were are many people desperate to work like I was.... it\u2019s really annoying. Don\u2019t understand how they got hired. Usually they tend to interview well but are awful employees,  and the people who interview terribly for whatever reason can actually be rock star employees. It\u2019s all backwards as hell.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lg5nuk/i_finally_got_a_job/gmrbx2u/"}
