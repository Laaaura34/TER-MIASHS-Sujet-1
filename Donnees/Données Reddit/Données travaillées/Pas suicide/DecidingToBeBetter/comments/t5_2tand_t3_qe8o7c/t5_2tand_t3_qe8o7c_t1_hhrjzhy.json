I feel exhausted all the time. \n\nI also wanted to use this opportunity to change careers as I have been in the restaurant industry over 12 years and it's hard for me to stay sober and keep track of my mental health working like that but I don't even know where to begin, because it's all I know. \n\nAnd yes, I live with my mother who is blind and I act as a bit of a caretaker since my father passed.
