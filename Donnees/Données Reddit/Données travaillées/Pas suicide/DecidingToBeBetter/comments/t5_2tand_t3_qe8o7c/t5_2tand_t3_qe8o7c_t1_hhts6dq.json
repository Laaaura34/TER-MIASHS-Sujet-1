It can cause a great deal of anxiety and depression over broken relationships and requires specific types of treatments, like dbt, internal family systems therapy, attachment therapy, etc. Cognitive behavioral and talk therapies aren\u2019t typically effective and can even exacerbate the issue. If you\u2019ve been going for months and experiencing a good amount of depression, it can be worth trying a new therapist. \n\nSometimes we can\u2019t move on from issues, like rejection from a partner, until we understand the underlying cause of what\u2019s keeping us attached to them. It can help to work this out with a therapist who is experienced in attachment issues and trauma so that you can let go and move on because you truly want a better life, not because you\u2019re trying to convince yourself you do. \n\nPlease be nice to yourself above all. Bpd is hard and a lot of people won\u2019t understand it. They\u2019ll tell you to get over things that seem easy to them but aren\u2019t for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qe8o7c/picking_up_my_life_after_a_nasty_break_up/hhts6dq/"}
