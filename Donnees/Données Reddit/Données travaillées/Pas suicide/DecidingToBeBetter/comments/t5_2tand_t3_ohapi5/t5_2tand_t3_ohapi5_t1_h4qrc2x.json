You can go to a gym or you can simply run 2 miles or speed walk. Then have a plate of vegetables. Then do yoga for just fifteen minutes---you can guide right on YT. You're going to note your mind will feel better. Then you make the above a habit five days a week. Decide that this isn't you any longer--the self harmer. You exercise five days a week, do an emotional program (yoga or tai chi or meditation). You limit caffeine and other light toxins which was the topic for my subs this week--because it affects the mood. So you have the physical and emotional program--then start advancing yourself. Look into college or a trade or a promotion or new cert in the one you have. What we are doing is bringing all the planes up with the tide. And you'll find if you take this course you will be different--and you won't want to hurt yourself. Then you help someone else. (like this physical therapist turned writer and YT'r who was once at rock bottom too.) Hope that helps---Charles", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ohapi5/24m_it_has_been_12_months_since_i_last_self/h4qrc2x/"}
