This is massive. Seriously. Never stop reminding yourself of how far you've come and how much resilience you've built up. It's a long and intense process, but you've been doing the work and it's paying off. I respect the effort you've put in.\n\nI'm just here to drop a CBT technique we learned to help manage self harm behavior through substitution. There's basically two versions we learned. One is an ice dive; either prep a bowl of ice and water or a Ziploc bag of ice and water, and cover or submerge your face for a minute being mindful of the feeling. You do it when you feel an urge to self harm. The ice stimulates similar nerve responses without causing harm and forces mindful presence. Another potentially 'riskier' version is using the ice water and dipping, say, a butter knife in and then applying it to the skin without force. It mimics self harm behavior so it can be risky, but the cold water causes a very similar sensation to actual self harm without the danger or risk that comes with physical harm.\n\nI'm not a professional, just sharing things I've learned over the years. Take it with a grain of salt and only try things that you don't feel are too risky. Keep being strong, and never lose sight of how hard you've worked to get where you are. I believe in you mate.
