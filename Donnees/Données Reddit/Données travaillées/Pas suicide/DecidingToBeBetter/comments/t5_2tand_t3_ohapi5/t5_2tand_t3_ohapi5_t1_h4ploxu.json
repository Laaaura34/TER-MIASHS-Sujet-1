Give yourself permission to let go of whatever is in your head and replace it with proactive and loving self talk about wherever you want to be going and trust that you\u2019ll get there as long as you stay on the path and keep believing. In the real world, make sure you also look out for people and situations that are affecting you negatively, and if you can\u2019t reframe them to be positive, start looking for a way out. You are a completely different person than you were as a child, and you will be a completely different person again. People change constantly, especially when they are unhappy. don\u2019t let yourself think you are an exception. You\u2019ll overcome this: keep believing in yourself and being proactive about the changes that will make you happy and you\u2019ll do it faster than you might think", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ohapi5/24m_it_has_been_12_months_since_i_last_self/h4ploxu/"}
