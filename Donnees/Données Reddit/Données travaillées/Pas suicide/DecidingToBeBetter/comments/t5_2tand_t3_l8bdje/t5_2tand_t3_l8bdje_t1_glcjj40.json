Wow!\n\nIts funny coz im reading your post and laughing like, this is obvious, but its only so as im reading it from you.\n\nI got heartbroken, nothing abnormal, but it's just been suuuper fucking difficult to 'let it go'. I got over my 8year relationship in about 6 months. This guy? We dated for 4 months and it took about...14 months to stop thinking of him everyday. Im now 16 months from when we broke up. I moved forward from my nanas death better than i have this (if im going to describe him how i would if this happened to a friend) coward.\n\nThank you for sharing. Im going to accept what is, and sit in it, and feel what i feel, and not shame myself for what comes through. Hope you have a great weekend x", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l8bdje/instead_of_focusing_on_letting_go_focus_on/glcjj40/"}
