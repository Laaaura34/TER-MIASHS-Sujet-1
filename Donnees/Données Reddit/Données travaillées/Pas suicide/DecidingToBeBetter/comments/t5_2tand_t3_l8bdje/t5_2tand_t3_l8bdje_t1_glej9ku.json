It hurts to think it's over, about the past experiences that will never be anymore. It also hurts to imagine her with someone else in the future and having a life apart from mine, considering up until recently we had a shared life and were walking together. It all hurts so much and Im not telling myself to let it go, it still hurts like hell.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l8bdje/instead_of_focusing_on_letting_go_focus_on/glej9ku/"}
