In a way I feel rebellious lol even though most of my friends haven\u2019t noticed I deleted it. But I recommend researching topics you have been wanting to learn about on YouTube, Reddit, or google etc. You can learn new hobbies, read books, focus on yourself and what you want to improve for the rest of the year. You can also watch new shows and movies that you have not gotten the chance to watch! I\u2019m excited for you to have a social media detox!
