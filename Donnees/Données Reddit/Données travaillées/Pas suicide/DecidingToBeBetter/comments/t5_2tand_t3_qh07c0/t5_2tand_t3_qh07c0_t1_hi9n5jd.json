I was really struggling with lack of productivity and had/have a couple of mental issues and I gotta say that getting rid of social media for a couple of months really improved my life back then. \n\nI deleted my accounts back then because I would always come back to IG or twitter out of boredom and boredom is the key word in this situation, or even better, it is the problem. At least it was for me. \n\nMy advice to you, as you got rid of you \"digital life\", is to improve your real life. Now that you'll not be spending time on social media you better take that time and do something that enhances your life, knowledge or even your mood. Its easier said than done, but try to do something, whatever you want or need to do, just do it. \n\nWhat worked for me was being productive (finishing a big project that I really had to), started working out, dedicated more time to my family and friends, man I even started reading, cooking and meditating. \n\nWish you the best of luck and success!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh07c0/i_have_deleted_twitter_and_instagram_from_my_phone/hi9n5jd/"}
