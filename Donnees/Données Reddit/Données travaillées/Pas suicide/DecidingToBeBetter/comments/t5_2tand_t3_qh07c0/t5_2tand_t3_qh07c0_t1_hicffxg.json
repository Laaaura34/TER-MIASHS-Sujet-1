The only thing I do online that is sort of \"social\" is Reddit, but Reddit isn't like FB or any of those others.\n\nYou will find that you learned alot from your relationship and that you can also do this thing called life being single.  I prefer to be single bc there's no drama, no arguing and I don't have to constantly feel run down by a girlfriend or wife.  There are good women out there to be in a relationship with, they are just very few and far between.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh07c0/i_have_deleted_twitter_and_instagram_from_my_phone/hicffxg/"}
