I'm anxious avoidant due to my needs not being met as a young child. This lead to me pushing loved ones away when things got \"too close\". I figured it out with my partner's help. She loves me and sees me as enough. I love her and respect her point of view. For me, it was realizing the value that I see in others, they also see in me. I've grown closer to my friends and my partner through learning to appreciate that they love me the same way I love them.
