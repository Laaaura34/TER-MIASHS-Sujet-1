I think you should recognize when you\u2019re doing it take a step back. \n\nI try to think Are there things I\u2019m doing that sabotage the relationship? If so why? \n\nAm I damaging the relationship on purpose and that\u2019s why I feel a disconnect. \n\nThe problem is that we become complacent in our relationships and we forget we need to build them. \n\nInstead of worrying about if they are going to leave you ask yourself a few things: why do I like this person? What makes this person irreplaceable? Is this person bringing value to my life? What is the value they bring? What am I getting from this person that I need. \n\nI love doing this because it makes me really appreciate the person or realize that if they leave me it\u2019s not worth caring about. It always hurts of course but it\u2019s easier to let go of someone who doesn\u2019t benefit you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5pg6b/i_realized_that_i_try_to_get_rid_of_people_before/h9crmbk/"}
