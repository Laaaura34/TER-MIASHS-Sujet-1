Firstly, am sorry to hear it. Break ups can be so tough in lots of ways but the loneliness is the worst in my view. \n\nOne thing I\u2019ve found useful is thinking about the three different types of loneliness. One, loneliness from lack of an intimate partner. Two, loneliness from lack of friends. Three, loneliness from lack of a community. I found myself often feeling all three of these, but felt I was not ready for relationship so focused on the last two. I joined a choir (community) and started a book group (friends) and also tried to reconnect/strengthen bonds with people already in my life who I wasn\u2019t massively close to. This is not a magic solution at all and took a lot of time and effort, but I think being social and making good relationships is a bit of a muscle and the more you do it, the better you get. Didn\u2019t happen overnight but I do feel a lot less lonely these days.\n\nOf course in the pandemic this is all pretty hard, but I wonder if thinking along these lines for when things open up, might help??", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lap494/how_to_deal_with_loneliness/glrwntz/"}
