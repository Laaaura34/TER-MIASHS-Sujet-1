I am confident and comfortable with myself and I don't give a crap what others think, including members of my own family.\n\nI'm retired and I live simply. I go for long walks, volunteer at animal shelters, watch my favorite tv shows, read, cook, etc. I have time. Time to sleep, time to clean my house so it's not in an utter state of chaos all the time. Time to visit my family and time to keep up with all of the errands of life...doctor's visits, car maintenance, self-care, etc. My life is in balance.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/34aego/what_does_the_ideal_you_look_like/cqtarx4/"}
