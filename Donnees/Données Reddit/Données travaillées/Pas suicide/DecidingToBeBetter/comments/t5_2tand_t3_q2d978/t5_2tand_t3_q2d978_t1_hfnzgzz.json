He judged everyone and everything around him while being a pathetic gamer constantly glued to his chair and an emotional abuser. It took years to realise the damage his words have caused me and many of his friends and exes. He treated exes like objects and that was disgusting to observe. When we tried to talk, he would blame us and say 'that's so immature blah blah'. It's definitely more immature to stay in their company and believe they will change.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2d978/i_left_a_toxic_relationship/hfnzgzz/"}
