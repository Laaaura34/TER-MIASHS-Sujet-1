I broke things off with a toxic relationship and about a month later he almost got me back\u2026 I\u2019m now four months away from that time and finding myself missing him. I know I will never go back and realize that I\u2019m just missing the good parts. Our relationship was really good when things went his way, but if there were any disagreements he always blamed me, I was the one at fault, he was always the victim\u2026 You get it! I have no idea why I miss him so much\u2026 Like I said I know I\u2019ll never go back or try to even go back. OP be ready for a roller coaster of emotions!
