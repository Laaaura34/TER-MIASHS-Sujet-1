I was in a toxic relationship for over 10 years. Supporting for the both of us, had a baby with him and doing everything i can. He was unemployed while i was schooling, working and taking care of our daughter while he was drinking, cheating and used domestic violence on me. I left him with our daughter and it\u2019s been 2 years, almost 3 as a single parent. I realized i was with a narcissistic and co parenting with a narcissistic is hard. \nNow i have a place of my own, a vehicle, supportive family and friends and my daughter who is now 5 years old. He made sure i was useless during our relationship thinking I can\u2019t live without him. I guess choosing to take care of yourself is so important, so you can take care of the ones you love. I am now 27 and happy. :) I wish you the best! <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2d978/i_left_a_toxic_relationship/hfmo39f/"}
