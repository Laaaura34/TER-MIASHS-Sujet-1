But respect is earned.   \nYou have no right to be treated respectfullly by the people you treat as trash. Is it noble for people to do so anyways? Yes. Is it sometimes better self care for people to walk away and a healthy sign they choose self respect over your sorry ass? Also yes.  \nDon't want to be treated like trash? Don't act like trash.  \nOften the biggest problem in toxic relationships in not people walking away out of respect for themselves, but instead projecting their good values like responsibility, empathy and sensibility on their partner and in that illusion they keep forgiving, talking, looking for solutions. Sometimes someone has been treated with more respect and courage/vulnerability than their behaviour deserves. If they don't value it: their loss. You have no obligation whatsoever to keep showing up for someone who doesn't reciprocate it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2d978/i_left_a_toxic_relationship/hfnyma1/"}
