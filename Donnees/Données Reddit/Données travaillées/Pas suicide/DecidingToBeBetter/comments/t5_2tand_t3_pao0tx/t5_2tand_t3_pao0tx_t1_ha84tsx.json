You can focus on your stress while writing (15-30 minutes daily) then compartmentalize your stress while with your girlfriend and others.  Focus on her/them.  You can look back in a week of journaling and see if you can spot patterns.  No one else (except maybe a therapist) needs to read it. Please remember that it is no one else's job to \"make you feel better/manage your emotions/solve all your problems\".  Everyone has bad days, we are all human, be a little less \"it's all about me, I'm so stubborn (pride/ego)\" because that gets real old real quick.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pao0tx/how_can_i_handle_my_stress_better_so_that_i_dont/ha84tsx/"}
