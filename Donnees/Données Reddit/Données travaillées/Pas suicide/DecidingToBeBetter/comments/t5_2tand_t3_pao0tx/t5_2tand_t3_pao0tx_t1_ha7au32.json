It\u2019s because [i need food, am overtired, I don\u2019t have any idea why]. Could I have a few minutes to calm down before we [talk about this, do (insert thing)] OR could I have a (cuddle/ hug / minute to vent)?\n\nThis doesn\u2019t leave her stressed and wondering if you will explode. It clearly outlines your mental state and let\u2019s her know you are working on it.\n\nOnce you have succeeded in calming down (at least enough to stop being negative. Partial calm downs are still a success. Just get off that ledge), let her know you are feeling better and ready to talk or do the thing. Make sure to let her know you appreciate the time and her support.\n\nIMPORTANT: verbalized to her that her needs are also important, and encourage her to do the same thing when she is overwhelmed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pao0tx/how_can_i_handle_my_stress_better_so_that_i_dont/ha7au32/"}
