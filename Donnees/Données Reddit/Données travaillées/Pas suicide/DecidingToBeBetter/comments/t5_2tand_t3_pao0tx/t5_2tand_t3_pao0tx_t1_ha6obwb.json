Or do you think you do it out of annoyance or impatience? How do you feel about the idea of practicing saying something like \"I feel stressed out, I'm going to take some quiet time to decompress\" or \"Sorry, I had a hard day, I don't really want to talk right now\"?

If you realize you're sulking around, say to your girlfriend \"I'm sorry, I don't know why I'm acting this way.
