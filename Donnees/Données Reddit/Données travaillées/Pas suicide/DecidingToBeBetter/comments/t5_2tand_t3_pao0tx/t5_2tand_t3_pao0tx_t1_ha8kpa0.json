There\u2019s a difference between going to someone, asking for exactly what you need (even if that\u2019s to vent!) and setting expectations correctly vs. Going to someone and expecting them to know exactly what to do to make you feel better without trying to process on your own. Even just asking your loved ones if it\u2019s a good time to take up space with your stress makes a huge difference to the people around you! Also, make sure you\u2019re doing your share to work on or change the things that make your situation stressful instead of being passive to it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pao0tx/how_can_i_handle_my_stress_better_so_that_i_dont/ha8kpa0/"}
