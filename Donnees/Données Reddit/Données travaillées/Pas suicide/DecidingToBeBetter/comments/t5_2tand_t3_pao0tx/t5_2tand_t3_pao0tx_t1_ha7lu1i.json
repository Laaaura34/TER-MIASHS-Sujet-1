I think of it as physical therapy for my nervous system (which regulates our emotions) and \"emotional processing lessons\" because that's something that was never specifically taught to many of us, but it can be learned! Therapists are professionals at leading people through processing the tough stuff. It can be all about your stresses and how to better deal with them. With the right therapist, it can be whatever you need. I see someone who uses body bases techniques, such as somatic experiencing. But the right kind of therapy is different for everyone.  ALSO, it's great that you're recognizing this dynamic in your relationship and making moves to have a more healthy dynamic for you and your partner! Great job and keep it up!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pao0tx/how_can_i_handle_my_stress_better_so_that_i_dont/ha7lu1i/"}
