I'm trying to find a job now. It's a bit difficult because the nearest bus stop is about a 30 minute walk (my town has horrible public transport) and I would not put it above my parents to physically pick me up off the side of the road.\n\nAs for the driving question. While they don't lock me in the house, they wouldn't allow me to stay after school during high school. Thus no drivers ed, and I am not allowed a permit. If I did get one I honestly don't know what they would do in response.\n\nThank you for the kick though (That's what I call it). I know I need to stop blaming them. It's just easier to say I lost my job because my parents wouldn't take me I guess. Hearing a stranger tell me off is kinda eye opening. I don't know if I'll stop blaming them for past jobs. It is something I'll have to think about though.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0i41d/ive_finally_decided_to_escape_my_parents_i_dont/hf9nho5/"}
