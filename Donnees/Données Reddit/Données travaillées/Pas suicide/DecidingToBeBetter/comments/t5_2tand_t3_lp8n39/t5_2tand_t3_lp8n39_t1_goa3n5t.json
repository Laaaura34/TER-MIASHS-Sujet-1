I barely exercised, and a friend encouraged me to sign up for one of those races. I started to train and after the race I kept training and became a fitter and healthier person. Now everyone sees me as the healthy adventorous guy. I got out of my comfort zone and out of character (the lazy guy) but found a new Hobbie and I mproved myself by becoming a new person.\n\nIn my mid 20s a friend told me he didn't understand why I was so shy considering that he found me fun and attractive, and encouraged me to go out more and party with him. After a while my selfsteem improved and I became much more social but also I started to party a lot, started to drink so much more, became reckless and irresponsible with my work and money. Until one day I decided to stop fooling around and brought balance back to my life. Stayed with the positive things I gained from stepping out of my comfort zone (improved selfsteem and social skills) but returned to the responsible, caring person I was my whole life. \n\nSo the thing is you have to be clear what are the things you want to improve but also have clear what are the things that you love about yourself and try to keep those intact.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lp8n39/how_do_you_differenciate_between_things_out_of/goa3n5t/"}
