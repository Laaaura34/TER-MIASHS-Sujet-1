You will never get those times back. The grass is not greener next year or the next 4 years. Enjoy and make the most out of now. The time is now.\n\nI'm 19. Have alot of regrets about highschool aswell. Just gotta accept and move on dude, because if you don't you will lose out of the time you have NOW (College).\n\nI still get sad or bitter or salty or nostaligic about high school. It's okay.
