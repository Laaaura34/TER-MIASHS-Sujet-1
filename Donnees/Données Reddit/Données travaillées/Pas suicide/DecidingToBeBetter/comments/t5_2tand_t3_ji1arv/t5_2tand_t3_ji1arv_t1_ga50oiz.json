Your life isn't over yet, and no matter the outcome of school or this new chapter of overcoming your addiction, you've done nothing to \"screw up\" your life for good. Everyone can start over and reattempt to make improvements towards a better future. The fact that you want to change is an amazing first step!   \n\n\nTherapy is your best bet. Someone trained in addiction can help you with recovery. You'll also need to visit the financial aid office and figure out what you need to do about your loans. If they're funded by the government, you can get on the income based payment plan. When I made under a certain income bracket, my loans were $0 per month. You'll want to do this sooner than later, because your credit history is at stake and could affect your ability to rent, finance a vehicle, etc. Plus, the sooner that you know the truth (which is more than likely to be a relief), you'll be able to focus on your mental health. I hope you get the help that you need.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji1arv/ive_backed_myself_into_a_corner_primarily_from/ga50oiz/"}
