Depending on what kinds of games you play, games can provide you with heavy dopamine rushes, and lead to an addiction that can resemble gambling or drug addiction. I second the other recommendations to see a therapist. While you might be able to quit cold turkey, it's not unlikely you'll experience some form of withdrawal. Your brain will be craving that dopamine, and will suddenly not be receiving it. A therapist can likely help with that, especially Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.\n\nBe kind to yourself on your journey. You're here because you're trying to be better, and I'm proud of you for taking that first step!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji1arv/ive_backed_myself_into_a_corner_primarily_from/ga5ucwb/"}
