I feel like I have trouble getting angry in the moment and it's made me feel like a doormat. I don't think I comprehend my anger correctly either but I'm coming at it from a different angle. \n\nBut with that in mind, something I am always doing during an argument assuming the other person is right? Like taking it as stone fact and assuming the problem is on your end. Whatever it is. Not that you should always assume you are wrong, but there is something you don't understand. And not understanding is a good enough reason to not act, back off and say sorry. At least until you do understand, or at least at minimum feel calm and rational. \n\nIt's not necessarily a conscious choice on my part. So perhaps this won't mean anything to you or be practical in any way. But that's how I deal with my anger.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/prcdzl/how_do_you_control_your_anger_and_stay_calm_in/hdhpoo2/"}
