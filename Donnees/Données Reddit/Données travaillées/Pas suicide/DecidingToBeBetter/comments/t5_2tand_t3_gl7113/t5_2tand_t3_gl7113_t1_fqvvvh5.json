I've been trying to eat healthy and cut out sugary drinks for 2 months now. I'm getting better at it, but take time. I've been having fruit daily and only one soda a week. It takes at least 30 days to build habits. Don't stress if you forget to do something one day. Also one thing that has helped is taking a look at bedroom layout. Maybe change the layout, clean it up, leave a book on the night side as it can be a reminder to read, even if its only 5 minutes a day or a page a day. Don't follow a schedule if your not good with time management, just be natural and let it happen and eventually you will do it subconsciously.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gl7113/you_guys_have_any_tips_with_following_a_routine/fqvvvh5/"}
