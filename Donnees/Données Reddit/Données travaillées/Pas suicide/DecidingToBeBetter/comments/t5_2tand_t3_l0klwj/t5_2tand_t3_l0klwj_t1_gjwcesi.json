As someone who has run businesses, failed businesses, and will continue to do the same thing, I have one big tip for you. DO NOT RUSH IT.

Good luck to you, I hope to see you on Forbes soon!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l0klwj/i_finally_got_an_idea_of_a_business_i_could/gjwcesi/"}
