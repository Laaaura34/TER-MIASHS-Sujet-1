Take it from an old Marine who fought in 3 wars while perfecting drinking, fighting and fu*king. Just admitting to or coming to terms with being a douche bag your whole life doesn't really mean shit to the long line if people you had a shitty effect on. \n\nThe bigger step to being a healthier, happier, \"better\" person is learning to love Yourself UNCONDITIONALLY, forgive Yourself, be kind and compassionate to Yourself. Work on YOU first, then it'll naturally spread to others. When you start to really figure that out, then you'll feel better and your relationships will start to be better. If people you wronged before still hate the old you, oh well, not much you can do to change the way they feel. Let your new relationships be the example of the real you that was hiding behind the A-hole persona that you used to be.\n\nThe important thing to keep in mind is that being an egocentric A-hole is a \"short game\" and being the wholesome, authentic You is a \"long game.\" Congratulations on moving up from the minors to the big leagues, just remember to play in the major leagues you gotta act like a mature adult or everyone's gonna see your just a minor league hack.\n\nSorry to come off gruff, but this old Gunny has been there and I know nothing kicks me into gear like a good dose of raw medicine.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pn6qgo/does_owning_up_to_my_mistakesunpleasant_life/hcnifjr/"}
