Refinishing old furniture? Organizing closets or going through old things? What about puzzles or Legos or other building type activities? I know you said the gym isn't your thing, but what about working on some body accomplishment at home? It could be working up to a certain # of something or a skill like doing a handstand. Walks aren't your thing, but have you tried geocaching? My husband who also isn't into walks is highly motivated by finding treasure. It also gets you to explore new places. What about volunteer work? Or big brothers/big sisters? If you're in STEM, I'm sure you could be useful as a tutor. I know it's not exactly entertainment but it does keep you somewhat occupied. \n\nFor entertainment, I personally use reddit, art, netflix, and books, so those don't seem to be your things.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lgkkzv/so_it_took_a_long_time_but_i_found_a_great_group/gmtfwe2/"}
