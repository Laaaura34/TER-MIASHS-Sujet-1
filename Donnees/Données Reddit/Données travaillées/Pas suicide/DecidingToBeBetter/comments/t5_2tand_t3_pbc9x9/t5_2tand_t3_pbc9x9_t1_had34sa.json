Listing 3 personal goals and intrapersonal goals a day (consciously decide who I want to give energy to - there's a lot of neuroscience behind compassion and gratitude).\n\nMany other habits too, Atomic Habits book truly deserving of the hype. 120lbs down so far, 100 more to go! Fuck morbid obesity, wheee!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I fell in love with Notion software and use it for everything from journalling to notes to habit tracking, personal rolodex etc. I mention this because my weeks worth of checkbox charts filled out is immensely helpful on the 'bad' days.\n\nI also bought a yearly agenda calendar thing, and I fill out important appointments in on it, but I also have a pack of themed stickers and I designate certain habits to stickers, writing in my new habits with pencil until they are deserving of a dedicated sticker.\n\nIt's SO nice to have a bad day and be able to scroll endlessly down a habit tracker chart and to go through a month in a physical calendar completely filled out.
