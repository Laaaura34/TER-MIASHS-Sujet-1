Doing an inventory of major life goals to make sure I'm regularly doing a little each day to push these big projects forward. Like reading a chapter of a textbook on a topic that I want to understand for work, for example.\n2. Decluttering and getting rid of all the stuff that I'd been meaning to get rid of for ages (RIP snowboard).\n3. Making sure that I use my lunch hour on working days to decompress, which could involve meditation, stretching, foam rolling, breathwork, etc.\n4. Burning through a steady stream of podcasts, because it can be pretty quiet at home alone. And I like to learn new stuff, explore new music, and laugh.\n5. Trying not to be too hard on myself when I'm falling short. And reaching out to friends that my relationship with has become somewhat stale with to see how I can help.
