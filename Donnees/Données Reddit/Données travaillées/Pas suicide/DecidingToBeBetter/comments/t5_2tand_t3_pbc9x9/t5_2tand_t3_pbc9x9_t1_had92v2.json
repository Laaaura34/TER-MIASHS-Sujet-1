Making \"green\" smoothies - never did it before lockdown, but now I crave them. I add protein powder, flaxseed, wheat grass, inulin, spirulina, and maca powder. It's helped me in 2 troublesome areas that I won't get into...\n2. I started doing Yoga (almost) every day. I love it. Sometimes I have bad/sad days and I realize yoga was my bright spot. at least there was that. I also have a lot of back pain and this helps, although the relief really only lasts the day.\n3. Trail running, which I did before lockdown, but I started going by myself and exploring all the trails near my house. Wow. Makes me feel alive and makes me pay attention and learn my way since I'm out there alone. \n4. Workin'! Staying on top of things. Making money. Not dreading working because I'm on top of things enough to where if I don't feel like working that day, I can give myself a break.\n5. Managing the household - cleaning, cooking, helping kids with school, etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbc9x9/top_5_habits_that_havehad_kept_you_sane_healthy/had92v2/"}
