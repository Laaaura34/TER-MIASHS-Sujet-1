Movement, of any type: Walk around the block, dancing, stretching, swinging my arms around, anything! \n2. Setting a quality each morning: I choose a word, like \"Calm\", and try to be that during the day. \n3. Take a shower/bath at night to wash the day away. \n4. Limit my time looking at the news (30 minutes at lunch). \n5. Tidy up every evening: Sweep, do dishes, litter pans, put things back, wipe table/counters down. \n\nI'm going to try oatmeal and Metamucil. Nutrition/diet is an area that I need to focus on (I don't need to lose weight, but need to eat more fiber).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbc9x9/top_5_habits_that_havehad_kept_you_sane_healthy/hace3az/"}
