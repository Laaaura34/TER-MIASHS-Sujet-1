I think the first to understand when tackling this is that masturbation in itself is not bad. Masturbation with the combination of something like a porn addiction is where problems lie, which is my current issue. I try to avoid any stimuli which might lead me to do it, but as you can see that's a work in progress. I have been focusing more on the content, and the time I spend doing it. I try to waste as least time as possible, like If I am going to do it, at least don't sink half your day into it. Another thing I would say is be selective of your content, there's a lot of screwed up shit on the internet, and you don't want to get post nut clarity on some rape scenerio or something weird like that, this means that even when you fail you won't feel like you're a monster. \n\nIt's honestly a learning experience, and you will most likely fall,  or be stuck at times where you fail day after day, but I try to focus on being kind on myself, and work on it from there. I don't really know how much I can say cause I'm not exactly successful, but if my insights have helped even a tiny bit that'll be nice.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbc9x9/top_5_habits_that_havehad_kept_you_sane_healthy/haeindt/"}
