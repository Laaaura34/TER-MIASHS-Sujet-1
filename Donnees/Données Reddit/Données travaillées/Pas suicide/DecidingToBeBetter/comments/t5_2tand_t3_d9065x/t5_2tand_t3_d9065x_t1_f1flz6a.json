Demanding respect is an easy way to lose respect. External factors definitely play a part, but not as much as you would think. If status, perceived value, and position were strictly the defining factors for respect, Donald Trump wouldn't be such a devisive name in public discourse. He has fame, wealth, and one of the most powerful positions in the world, currently, and he's got about half the country calling to have him impeached. \n\nHow you carry yourself garners respect. Your values are what garner respect. Whether or not you can stand up for yourself, too. All of these factors come from how you view yourself, your self-respect, what you value, and how you express all of the above.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d9065x/why_you_should_always_be_genuine/f1flz6a/"}
