Plus, I've let go of a lot of issues I didn't even know I had been holding onto for years. I had a ton of self-esteem issues and thought I was socially inept, but when I started being open about myself, conversation just flowed more naturally and I realized I wasn't quite the social dingus I thought I was. There's still a lot that I don't like about myself, but I don't get hung up on it as much anymore. I just focus on improving one thing at a time and now I'm just crafting myself into the person I want to be.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d9065x/why_you_should_always_be_genuine/f1f2ts3/"}
