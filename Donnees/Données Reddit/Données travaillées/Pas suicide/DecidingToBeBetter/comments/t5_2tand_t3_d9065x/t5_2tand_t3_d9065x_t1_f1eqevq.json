On the contrary, it should encourage you to be who you want to be. If you are not happy with who you are right now, then of course that is something that you should work on. Actually, being open and honest about your insecurities and shortcomings is a great way of overcoming them. Being honest with yourself helps you diagnose the problem and makes it clear what you have to work on. Furthermore, once you start expressing that openly to others, you would be surprised by how many people that have (or have had) the same concerns, and that are more than willing to help you improve.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d9065x/why_you_should_always_be_genuine/f1eqevq/"}
