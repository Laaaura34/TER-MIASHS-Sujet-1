No lights in the bedroom. Crank the AC low. Set your alarms before you get in there so you don't have even the light of your phone on your face.\n\nWake up and start your day with a positive attitude. Tell yourself you will get up as soon as your alarm goes off, then do it. Don't question it. I always have to pee first, but the very next thing I do is drink a full glass of room temperature water (you dehydrate at night, every morning is like a mini hang over if I don't hydrate). \n\nThen I take a hot shower to warm my body up and fully wake me up. Then I brush my teeth and floss. \n\nThen I find somewhere quiet to sit and watch the sunrise and enjoy the stillness of the morning for 5 minutes or so (I have an app I made that pulls sunrise data and sets an alarm based on it).\n\nThat's my favorite part of the day. Doing my routine, getting hydrated and warmed up and my mind settled for a morning of incredibly productive work.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz6be2/how_do_i_turn_myself_into_a_morning_person/hf0702u/"}
