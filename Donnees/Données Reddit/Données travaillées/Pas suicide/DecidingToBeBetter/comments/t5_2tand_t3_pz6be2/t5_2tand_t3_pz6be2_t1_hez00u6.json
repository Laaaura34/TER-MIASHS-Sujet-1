I didn't realize just how much of a night person I am. Before, I depended heavily on coffee and even then, I struggled those first few hours, did ok midshift, but was exhausted by the end of the day. I required 8-9 hours of sleep, too. \n\nNow? Man. I wake up about 6pm, have dinner with the family, get to work by 8:30pm and am wide awake until about 9am the following morning. I am sharp throughout the shift, am a lot more physically active than I was before, I can get away with a lot less sleep if necessary, and am infinitely happier. \n\nNot suggesting that you should so what I do.
