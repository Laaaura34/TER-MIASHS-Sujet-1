I've found that a glass of cold water and a hot shower first thing out of bed usually help to push through the fog.\n\nTry moving your alarm clock into another room to force you out of bed. I put mine into the bathroom, so I could hop directly into the shower when I shut it off. \n\nCaffeine is your best friend. Coffee, energy drinks or over the counter tablets will help you start the day off strong. \n \nIt will be tough at first, but you should adjust to your new wake up time within a week and a half or so. \n\nBecoming an early riser can be a challenging goal to achieve, but well worth it. I've always been a heavy weed smoker and night owl, and used to struggle with mornings all the time. It made me feel lazy and irresponsible, but I started to feel so much more accomplished, and honestly kind of proud of myself once it became habit. \n\nGet yourself a bedtime routine and a wake up time that works for you, and just stick to it and grind it out. It's well worth fighting through the morning grogginess\n\nGood luck with your goal \ud83d\udc4d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz6be2/how_do_i_turn_myself_into_a_morning_person/heyvhvq/"}
