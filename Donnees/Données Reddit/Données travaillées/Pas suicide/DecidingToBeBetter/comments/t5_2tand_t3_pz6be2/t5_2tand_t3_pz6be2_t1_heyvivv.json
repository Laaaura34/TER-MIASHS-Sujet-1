And you get up at 7 let\u2019s say, start small. Start at 6:30, do that a for a week, then 6:15? If that\u2019s easy then 6, next week rock out 5:45, then 5:30, within a month you\u2019ll be there no matter what, and realistically you\u2019ll surprise yourself with how the small increments make it easy.\nSecond, when you go to be and how you go to bed is important too, leave yourself enough a time for a 6-8 hour sleep. Try to eliminate distractions before bed maybe get headspace or calm to help sleep\nThird, put your phone on he other side of the room beside all of your clothes you need for the morning. You\u2019ll be forced to go over there and it\u2019s as easy as stepping into new clothes. \nHope this helps best of luck, it\u2019s how I switched for a \u2018wake up whenever\u2019 to a nice 5am run for the past few months \nThird", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz6be2/how_do_i_turn_myself_into_a_morning_person/heyvivv/"}
