I struggle with this too at times. One of my first thoughts is that you first need to help yourself out before you can help others. Organizations that help people are (un)fortunately run by people, and we sure can suck sometimes. But we can be amazing too.\n\nTwo practices came to mind when I read your post.\n\n1 - Practice Gratitude. Every day, write down 3 things you're grateful for. You can't just know intellectually that you're grateful for the things you have, you have to actually practice gratitude. With practice, you'll start looking for things for which you're grateful, and you might be surprised with what you find. \n\n2  - Loving Kindness Meditation. You're focused on the negative in the world right now, and the negatives in your own live. That's okay, there's a lot in the world that is negative, but you've trained your mind to look for that negative. \"Neurons that wire together, fire together.\" You need to interrupt this pattern, and retrain your brain. It's not that you can't acknowledge the negativity in the world, but you're kind of soaked in it right now. The book, Buddha's Brain by Rick Hanson talks about retraining your brain if you want further reading.\n\nLoving Kindness meditation will focus on giving yourself compassion and extending that compassion to others. There are tons of guided loving kindness meditations out there. Find one you like and give a try for a few weeks.\n\nBest of luck to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a41kv5/feeling_beat_down_by_lifemidlife_doldrums/ebbf5xh/"}
