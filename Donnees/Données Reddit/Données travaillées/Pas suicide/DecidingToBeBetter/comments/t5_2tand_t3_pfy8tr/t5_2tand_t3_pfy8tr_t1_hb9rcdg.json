It seems you\u2019re not securely attached to your partner and it would be def good to seek therapy and find out what the reason behind that is. Maybe trauma, or maybe his attachment style is not compatible with yours. Maybe he has an avoidant attachment style. That could trigger your behavior and make it worse. Sometimes it\u2019s not you it\u2019s the combination of two people.\n\nI'm sooo glad someone brought this up. It's so easy to say one person is overreacting or too jealous and insecure, and it's very big of you to recognize your own feelings of jealousy are affecting your relationship. But have you also addressed how your partner handles these projections of insecurity? What is specifically triggering your feelings of jealousy? Is your partner respectful of those triggers? Have you set boundaries regarding what you both consider appropriate and inappropriate behavior in your relationship? These are all important issues to address in healing your own jealous behaviors. \n\nI'd invite you to look more into codependency and see if any of that resonates with you. You are taking on a lot of the blame with your problematic behaviors, which is good to see you take responsibility for. I guess my concern is if you are taking on the responsibility for your partner as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hb9rcdg/"}
