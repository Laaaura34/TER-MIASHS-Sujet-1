I'm an avoidant type and my husband is definitely anxious. This wasn't causing us problems until covid, when my husband went full WFH and also cut out most of his socializing activities. Before this, he worked a ton and had social hobbies and I had plenty of space and my own things going on, and never felt burdened or smothered.   \n  \nNow, it's like I'm just trying to carve out little slices of time to myself, and despite us spending nearly all day together, he needs \"more.\" So if I want to meet a friend on the weekend, he sees it as me \"choosing\" this friend over him - even though we've been together the last 6 days straight. Which is super frustrating for me. It's a mess. Sorry for ranting! \n \nDo you have any resources, like books or articles, for improving our attachment styles?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hb9feey/"}
