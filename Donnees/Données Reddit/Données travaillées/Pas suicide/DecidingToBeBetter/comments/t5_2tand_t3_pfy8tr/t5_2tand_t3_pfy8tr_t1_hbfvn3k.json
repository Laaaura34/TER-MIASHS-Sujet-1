I read about codependency. And I'd say I am a little bit codependent. I've watched a video about attachment styles weeks before posting this. My partner wasn't avoidant before but now he's avoidant which triggers me a lot. And he gets upset whenever I'm trying to talk about my feelings so we usually get into fights, discussions or disagreements. I also read some of our conversations and try to remember some verbal convo and you are right, my partner feels like I am demanding and asking for too much when he's already doing things for me. :')", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hbfvn3k/"}
