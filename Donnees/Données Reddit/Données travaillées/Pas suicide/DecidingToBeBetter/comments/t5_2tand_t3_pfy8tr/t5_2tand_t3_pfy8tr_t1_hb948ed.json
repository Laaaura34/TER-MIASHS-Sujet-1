Simply because a podcast I was listening to said a sentence that made an anxiety of mine go apeshit for a minute. I walked to the open empty room at work and confronted the anxiety - asking it why. Why was my brain panicking about this? Oh. It wasn't what my brain was telling me...it was plain, simple insecurity! \n\nUpon realizing that, couldn't stop crying for a few minutes. Now I feel better, the insecurity is quelled till I can work on the original anxiety (a task I do weekendly) and I can keep working up the path of success I've put myself on!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hb948ed/"}
