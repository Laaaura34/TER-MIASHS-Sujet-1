Problem diagnosed. Now the hard part. Fixing it.\n\nBTW, it just happens. We learn social interactions as children. The process is very random. It depends on environment very much. Most social behavioral patterns you catch from your parents.\n\nDon't feel bad for yourself, it's not your fault. Technically - it is. You have learned wrong behavioral patterns. Now they are involuntary, you don't have control over it. It just how your brain reacts on low level. You can TRY to control it, but it would hurt and won't be natural for a long time until you learn.\n\nNot your fault if you want to find a reason behind it. The reason is environment. The child is not responsible for learning the right patterns, or... learning anything at all. We are programmed and then punished for our programming.\n\nBut look at the bright side - our memory is not ROM. Not read-only. You can reprogram, but... The memory is not RAM either. Reprogramming is pretty hard. But again look at the bright side - not many people has the right programming. We all have to do it all the time. Nobody's perfect. Common people have common bugs. Good thing is they are fixable, it's just hard and takes a lot of effort.\n\nBut by all means do that. Reprogram yourself before it's too late. Source: for me it's too late. I missed my window of opportunity. I didn't know what you know when I had time to change it. I thought it's just \"bad luck\", or \"things happen\", or \"people are weird\". Important thing - if you don't fix it - it won't fix itself. It will ruin your social and personal life. It's 100% guaranteed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hbaa5ae/"}
