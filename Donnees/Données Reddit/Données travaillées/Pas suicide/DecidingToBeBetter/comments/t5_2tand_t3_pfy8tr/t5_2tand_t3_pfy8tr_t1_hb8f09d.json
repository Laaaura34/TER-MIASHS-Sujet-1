Meaning we can have different attachment styles with different people. I\u2019ve been very insecure and needy with one partner and totally securely attached with another (my now husband): I\u2019ve been super jealous and possessive with one partner whereas with another partner I was feeling safe and was never jealous in the least.\n It also sounds like there is a little bit of codependency going on. It seems you\u2019re not securely attached to your partner and it would be def good to seek therapy and find out what the reason behind that is. Maybe trauma, or maybe his attachment style is not compatible with yours. Maybe he has an avoidant attachment style. That could trigger your behavior and make it worse. Sometimes it\u2019s not you it\u2019s the combination of two people. Maybe you know how you were with other people before and can compare it?\nAnother thing is that people have different love languages and sometimes don\u2019t understand one another. For example maybe you need to hear \u201cI love you\u201d from your partner and you need a lot of physical affection to understand he loves you and then his love language is more like \u201cI need to do a lot of things for her\u201d or \u201cI need to bring her presents\u201d when all you want is a hug and a cuddle. That could make you feel like he doesn\u2019t love you but all it is is a different love language of expressing affection for your partner. That can cause a lot of insecurity too. Good luck finding out! All the best to you!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hb8f09d/"}
