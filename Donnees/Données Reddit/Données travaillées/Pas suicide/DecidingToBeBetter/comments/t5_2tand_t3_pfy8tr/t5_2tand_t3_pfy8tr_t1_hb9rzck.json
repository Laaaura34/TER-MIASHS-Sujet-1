If you follow the work of Dr. Stan Tatkin and his audiobook Your Brain on Love, you might find that there are ways you and your partner can support each other to feel more secure. While it's your responsibility to work on this and good for you for recognizing it, I don't think it's fair to label yourself a toxic person. Your brain is wired to respond in a certain way due to past experiences and conditioning. Our partners are usually the ones who inadvertently trigger us the most. It helps to have a mutually supportive relationship where you can work through these issues together, while also taking responsibility for your own issues. \n\nAnd it's great that you're letting yourself feel the pain.
