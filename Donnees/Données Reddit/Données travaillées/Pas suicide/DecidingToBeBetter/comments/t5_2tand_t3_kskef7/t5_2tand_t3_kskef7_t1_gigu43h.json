The goal of seeing my psychiatrist was to figure out what kind of medication I could be on so that I could feel well enough to properly cope and work on myself. I don\u2019t feel like in my case it\u2019s necessary for us to \u201cclick\u201d although she is kind and understanding. Now that I\u2019m feeling so much better, I\u2019m on the hunt for a therapist that I can click with and who can help me make even more progress.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kskef7/with_access_to_video_appointments_now_its_easier/gigu43h/"}
