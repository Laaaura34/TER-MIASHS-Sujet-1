They will usually say if they\u2019re accepting new patients or not. Once you see one you are interested in (remember, location doesn\u2019t matter), call and express that you are interested in seeing Dr. X for psychiatry and confirm that they are accepting new patients. Depending on the timeline of availability, they may have a different doctor available sooner. As I said in another comment, to me it doesn\u2019t really matter if I \u201cclick\u201d with my psychiatrist or not. I just need someone to diagnose me and help me through the medication side of things.\n\nThe best part is that you can be in the comfort of your own home, which helps tremendously. I have social anxiety and I can tell you that my psych zoom appointments are NOWHERE near as scary as I thought they would be. I highly recommend reaching out to someone today!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kskef7/with_access_to_video_appointments_now_its_easier/gijh8r8/"}
