My home is spotless and it stays that way. My child gets to his classes/practices on time and is doing well. I am burnt out, not lazy. \n\nI think the most spot on thing that was said in this thread is that I don't have meaningful goals at the moment, after having arrived at a place that I worked very hard to get to. The goals I have right now aren't authentic to what is actually meaningful to me, and therefore not particularly motivating. \n\nMy life has never consisted of the amount of freedom to come home, chill, and zone out. Until recently. I've indulged in it guilt free for a bit, and now it's time to redefine some meaning for myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt8bz1/i_have_lived_a_relatively_formless_life_for/hdwa9yt/"}
