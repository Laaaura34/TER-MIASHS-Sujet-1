You reached that and now don't know what to do with yourself.  \n\nWhat do you want out of life?  If you could describe your perfect day what would it be?  Where would you live?  Would you travel?  Do you want to retire early?\n\nMy guess is to start thinking along those lines.  Goals for the sake of having goals usually aren't helpful but if you start thinking deeper on what you value and what's important to you it might start providing some direction and purpose.   \n\nFor example, if you get excited about owning a home near a beach then you might get over your aversion to budgeting and start looking at your finances.  You will also be less likely to blow money because that new <shiny object> isn't as important to you as being able to walk to the beach everyday.\n\nI would worry less about whether you have structure or routine and more on finding a direction/purpose and making sure you are moving towards it.  I say this as someone who is the exact opposite and am so into routines/structure that I have to actively add some chaos on my life just for my own health. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt8bz1/i_have_lived_a_relatively_formless_life_for/hdupyhl/"}
