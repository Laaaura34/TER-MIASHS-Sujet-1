That\u2019s it. \n\nIt turns out, I know very little about the healthy version of me! \n\nYou nailed it on the head that I have goals that are not meaningful to me. The culture at my brokerage has helped me define these \u201csocial goals\u201d, which are framed as personal development\u2026but really feel like measures of comparison to others. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely time for me to find some purpose beyond not being broke and not having a defined work schedule. \n\nAs a little side - my boyfriend is very much like you\u2026the opposite of me!
