But I agree that I don\u2019t think that is your case (and that is GREAT news btw, because it is annoying to everyone, including the individual). I think, from your one post, that you are self aware, obviously intelligent, innovative, motivated, etc. You built your own empire whether you want to look at it like that or not, and you deserve to feel proud of your accomplishments. And as you are a self aware person and wanting to change a few small \u201cbad\u201d habits that you desire to change, you are overall likely a good person and will end up doing exactly what you have written you desire to do. Because, at the end of the day, you seem to know exactly what you need to do and want, and you have done it before it, quite successfully. For tiny tips on tidying, organizing, managing, etc., you have google! And I would say, as much as possible, simplify life. Less is always more when it comes to gratification. Doesn\u2019t mean being a pauper but, when there is so much chaos in life, sometimes we forget what truly brings us joy. Often it is more satisfying to have a few luxury items as opposed to a \u201cthousand\u201d worthless items. Any who, as a single working mom myself with an unplanned pregnancy, I tip my hat to you, my fellow.
