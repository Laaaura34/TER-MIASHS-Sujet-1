It has cost me my marriage, my health, my mental stability, spiritual well being, and self confidence. Come up with a plan and set goals that will make you stretch, not even ones that are necessarily \u201cporn related.\u201d Fill your time with something else. I asked myself, who is going to make these changes in me? Someone else? No. It has to be me. The other option is to continue to suffer. Make time for other things. The time you use for porn can be used for something else (exercise, reading, writing, learning an instrument, etc.) \nI heard \u201cno one is coming to save you\u201d and it stuck with me. The only person to live your life is you. Go get it.\nPut space between you and porn for a long time and your body will reset. See yourself as a person, see others as people with deep worth, even on a spiritual level if you practice a form of spirituality. But don\u2019t see them as objects. Set boundaries and get to know people as people, especially the sex you are attracted to.\nHope this helps. Know you aren\u2019t alone!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q42z7z/please_help_me_to_be_better_and_recover_from_this/hfvq286/"}
