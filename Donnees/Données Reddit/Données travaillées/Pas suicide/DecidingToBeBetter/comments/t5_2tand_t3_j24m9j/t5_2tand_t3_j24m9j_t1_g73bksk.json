Since my breakup 8 months ago, I haven't been able to open up to anybody. I've had a couple rebounds that expected me to stay, but I just couldn't. It made me feel like shit. \n\nIt's just now getting to me that my issue is that I want to have companionship in life, but I'm just not ready to open up again, and that's not fair to other people. I guess I'm still mending, though I thought I had moved fully past my old relationship. I also don't have much to offer, but hopefully that will change when I finish school. For now, we'll just keep going with ourselves. In time dude, in time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j24m9j/today_a_close_friend_told_me_he_loved_me_and_it/g73bksk/"}
