Start daily affirmations! My therapist has recommended I do it and I want to start. I bought these cards and plan on reading one to myself in the morning.\n\n2. Network more. Get out of my comfort zone and try to connect with more people professionally and personally. My goal is to work towards finding a job I absolutely love next year. I\u2019ve been unhappy with my career and it\u2019s time to change that.\n\n3. Save $10K. I saved $10K in 2020 and I feel so good about myself. I\u2019d love to double that and have $20K saved up.\n\n4. Stick to a tangible exercise and lifestyle program! Diets have plagued me my whole life. I learned how to cook more in 2020 and want to continue learning more. More fruits and veggies. Less bad self talk about what I eat and how much I eat.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg105q/im_starting_to_become_more_of_my_authentic_self/ggczrne/"}
