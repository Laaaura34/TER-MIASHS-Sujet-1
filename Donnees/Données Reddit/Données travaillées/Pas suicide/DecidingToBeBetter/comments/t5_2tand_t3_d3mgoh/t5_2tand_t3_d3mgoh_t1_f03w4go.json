If you set your mind to it and be consistent, you can do it. Three years is a lot of time. I just turned 27 in July and gave myself similar goals; however the only aspect of my life that is proper adult is my job finally. (landed a sweet IT job a month ago). By 30 I want to be my own man, be able to cook for myself, do taxes, essentially live on my own and know how to do it. That includes moving out; as I'm still living (luckily, or unluckily) with my parents. So yeah, good luck on your journey. May we both make it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d3mgoh/3_years_to_real_adult_hood/f03w4go/"}
