They end up building a friendship, but the guilt from it doesn't really go away and he has a hard time building friendships with anyone because of it. My main takeaway from it, and by extention my advice to you, would be that you are not who you were in the past. When you decide to change, *you* change and become a different person. The guilt you are feeling is proof you have grown, and much like the way you might cringe about blunders from your younger years, it is a form of regret. You seem to feel you need punishment for your actions, because you regret it deeply and want the guilt to go away. But I think embrasing the guilt as growth and reminding yourself that you chose to be different and therefore you ARE different is a good way to look at your situation. I feel like it might be worth considering therapy also, if you still have a hard time resolving the guilt and find that it interferes in your relationships.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/piix2e/i_used_to_make_fun_of_a_girl_in_elementary_school/hbpxdxi/"}
