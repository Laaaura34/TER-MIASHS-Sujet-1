I have been trying to tell myself that I am not who I used to be and that I do have friends and a partner that love and care for me. I told my partner this yesterday and even he told me that he couldn\u2019t see me as a bad person cause he sees that I am not at all that person now which made me feel better, but it still dawned on me. \n\nI have considered therapy, and in the future I might try and get it when I get other things sorted. I appreciate your response :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/piix2e/i_used_to_make_fun_of_a_girl_in_elementary_school/hbq0bgu/"}
