And I kinda feel so wronged by my so called friends. And I am disappointed in them somehow( not all but a few). And I am reading a few books and realizing so much about myself and my childhood and my life in general and I feel so alone at times. I just want to hug someone and cry and cry but I can\u2019t even do that. And to top this I am stuck In another country where I don\u2019t even speak the language and can\u2019t meet people because covid, and every one has their own lives and I am so sick of speaking on phones and seeing people virtually. I don\u2019t feel like going back to my home country because I don\u2019t feel like being near my parents all the time, I need my space. And I get to do things my own way which I have gotten so much used to. Sometimes I really really want to end my life but then I think about my parents and I have to stop that thought. I am feeling so depressed at times and I feel like I want to talk to that one person who is not even in my life anymore because he cannot and I just keep hoping one day he will call and tell me everything\u2019s gonna be okay because I am tired of telling myself that. I spoke to so many psychs but that all went in vain. And I really don\u2019t know what to do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjw9g2/i_beg_you_please_read_this_if_you_feel_like/gtd6a3v/"}
