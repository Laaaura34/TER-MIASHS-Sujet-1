There is no \"fact\" here, the only thing you \"admitted\" was a string of insults about yourself designed to force her to react the way you wanted her to react. \n\n\"I need you to manage my mental health\" is an impossible thing to put on someone. When you say \"I'm a baby who can't manage myself\", you're not asking for \"help\" you're asking for the same deal a baby gets - to have all responsibility taken off you. \n\nYour girlfriend cannot manage your mind for you. The only thing that will happen with this arrangement of affairs is that she will burn out rapidly, and then you'll act horribly towards her because she \"promised to help\". \n\nI notice that your feed is 50% posts saying you can't cope, 50% advice to others. You seem like you cannot decide whether you are depressed or whether you're somebody who can teach others not to be depressed. \n\nYou need to get rid of the 50% that wants to advise others. You are not in a position to advise others - you are lost. Putting the expectation of helping others on yourself will only worsen your own condition. The time you spend advising others would be better spent reading books about better psychological functioning\n\nSecondly, if you're taking drugs (which includes alcohol) regularly you need to stop - these will be the source of your low mood.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjw9g2/i_beg_you_please_read_this_if_you_feel_like/gtcwako/"}
