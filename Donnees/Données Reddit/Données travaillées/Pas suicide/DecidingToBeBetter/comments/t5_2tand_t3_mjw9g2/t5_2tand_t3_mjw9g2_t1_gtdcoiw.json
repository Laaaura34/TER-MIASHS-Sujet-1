IMO, when it comes to asking for help, consent is key. You're not responsible for predicting what your partner is willing to help with, or what their limits are, so you might as well ask. They're allowed to say, \"I really wish I could help you, but I just don't have the spoons.\" and that's okay. Don't push it from there, and don't antagonize them for setting their own boundaries. \n\nI love what you said about, \"I need help baking the cake\" because you can totally use that to help communicate specifics to your support group. \n\nRather than, \"I need help making the whole cake\", maybe you just need someone to stand next to you and chat while you bake the cake.\n\nOr maybe you're able to pre heat the oven and do the mixing, but you need help with cracking the eggs.\n\nIt's really hard asking for help, and I'm so glad you were able to do that all! You should definitely be proud of yourself \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjw9g2/i_beg_you_please_read_this_if_you_feel_like/gtdcoiw/"}
