If you had asked me about career 15 days ago, I would have laughed. I wasn't really having a good time for years, I was thinking about suicide and  just be done with this life. So I just stopped my meds, and just read and watch some good shows while I still can. And  on a whim, I  updated my resume on a job portal without expecting anything. Next I know I got few mails and calls to enquire about a job opening, and they scheduled interviews for next week. I've not gotten that job yet, and I probably will not, but knowing that someone considered me even for initial screening makes me feel good, like I'm not that bad. So just hang in there, you don't know what happens next. But if you give up now, you will never know.\n\nAll the very best, and  I hope you get happiness.\nIf you ever want to talk, I'm here.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqbds/i_hate_looking_for_a_job_no_one_will_hire_me/hcylppn/"}
