Food work, cleaning jobs etc??\n\nBecause right now, it might be hard to find a job out of school or something with a degree looking for a career, but if you walked into literally any restaurant or applied for any warehouse job or cleaning job, you'd get hired no matter what. Every single place near my house is trying to hire, to the point that even my work will just hire anyone at first sight and it is not the only place, everywhere in town is in this same position.\n\nPretty much, as of late, me and anyone I talk to at least in suburban Missouri has come to the conclusion of \"if you do not have a job right now, it is because you don't want one\".\n\nJust work at a restaurant, you will get hired immediately.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqbds/i_hate_looking_for_a_job_no_one_will_hire_me/hcz8kme/"}
