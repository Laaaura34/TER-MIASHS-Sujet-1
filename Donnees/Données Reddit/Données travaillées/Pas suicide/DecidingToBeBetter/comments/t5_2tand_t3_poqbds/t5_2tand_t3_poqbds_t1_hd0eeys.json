What were the specialties? What are your strengths?\n\nAre you an expert at something? Fuck it, don't listen to your parents, listen to your passion. Don't give up on your dreams but don't chase them forever. get something you like and will make you some money. Your voice? hmmm well have you tried what's good/bad about your voice? Have you considered narration as a strange thing to do? What about a podcast? Something creative?\n\nThough if you don't want to speak, there are many jobs out there that can easily be handled if you do not want to speak. I don't know many but I am sure you have an idea since you keep asking the right questions, follow your intuitions. Don't try YouTube, it's a huge gamble to dedicate it on the art, unless you know your craft.\n\nTry cooking? Cleaning? Being a security guard? A painter? Something abstract? Something digital?
