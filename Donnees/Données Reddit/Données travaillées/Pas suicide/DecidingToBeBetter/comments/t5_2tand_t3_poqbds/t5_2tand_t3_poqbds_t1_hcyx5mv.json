Almost got a job once but then got asked about pay. I gave a reasonable (almost too low) range and they still turned me down. \n\nI\u2019ve seriously been considering just getting a boring remote position or driving for Amazon. At least I\u2019m pretty good at typing fast and doing remote work and driving safely. \n\nI\u2019m pretty scared though because I\u2019m turning the age I need to have my own insurance and food and all the adulting stuff in a few months. Will I be able to support myself? My parents (mostly my mom) are mostly fine with me living at home as long as I pay rent. I help out a lot. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll look down on me for not getting a \u201creal\u201d relevant job like I\u2019m supposed (UX Designer/Researcher).
