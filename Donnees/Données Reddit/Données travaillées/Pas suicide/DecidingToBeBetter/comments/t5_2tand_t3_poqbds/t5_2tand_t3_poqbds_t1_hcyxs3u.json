The company I work for has preferred vendors we work with based on contracts and details to which I\u2019m not privy. I don\u2019t work with them in a capacity to be able to recommend a specific company.\n\nI\u2019d encourage you to research this yourself and see what they can offer you. Some offer benefits like health insurance and pto, for example. Like all things, work on your resume and reach out to a few and shop them like you\u2019d buy a car or house.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqbds/i_hate_looking_for_a_job_no_one_will_hire_me/hcyxs3u/"}
