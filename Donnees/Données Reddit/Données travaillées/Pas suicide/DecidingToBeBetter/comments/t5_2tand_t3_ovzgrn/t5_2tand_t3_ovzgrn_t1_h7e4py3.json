I still struggle with my first instinct being to run or shy away from hard things, but what helps is I write out what is the worst thing that could happen if I actually do it, kind of like facing my worst fear head on and just keep writing or playing that scenario out.. until I realize things will always keep going and I will always have a plan or next move to make, and I\u2019ll be happy with myself that I tried and at least I\u2019m not still stuck in the place I was before. I have hope and I\u2019m rooting for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovzgrn/two_things_i_have_learned_over_the_last_3_years/h7e4py3/"}
