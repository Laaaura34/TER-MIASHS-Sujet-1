I'm glad you pointed the mattress part out cause for the past few months I had been sleeping on the couch cause I was having trouble with sleep so I decided to work in the hall and sleep whenever I could so I would sleep on the couch which is firmer than my bed and my back ache vanished. Perhaps I should just do that till I get a new mattress cause you are totally right about the firmness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nwfsl7/how_do_i_improve_my_health/h19v7yd/"}
