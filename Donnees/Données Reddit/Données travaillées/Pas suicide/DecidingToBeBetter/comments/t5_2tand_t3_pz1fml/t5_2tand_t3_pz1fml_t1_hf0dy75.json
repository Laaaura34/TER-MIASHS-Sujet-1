The early withdrawals suck yes, but what happens after is almost like a euphoric phase where you just feel great and super motivated with a lust for life. That will fade over time as you adjust to being sober and that is when you will begin to rationalize just having a few puffs and before you know it you're back to everyday toking. My advice is just be aware that the sober, almost manic high you get from quitting will go away and make sure you have something in your life that can occupy or distract you once that motivation fades.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz1fml/im_done_abusing_my_brain_and_lungs_im_quitting/hf0dy75/"}
