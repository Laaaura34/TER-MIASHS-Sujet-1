Also try your best to stay busy, it's so easy to sit and let your brain over work itself in a disorganized way. When I quit that's when my adhd symptoms really came into play so if you haven't seen a psych definitely do that. Remember your goals and purpose, it's so easy to feel depersonalized after quitting. Also remember if you smoke again it won't be the same at all, for me the anxiety was just too much to enjoy it. Seems like you're in the same boat as me but a month or so later. Message me if you need someone going through the same thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz1fml/im_done_abusing_my_brain_and_lungs_im_quitting/hezjlve/"}
