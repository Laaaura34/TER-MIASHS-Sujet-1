I didn\u2019t realize how deep of an addiction it became until I was far down the rabbit hole. It\u2019s kept me lazy and unproductive. The turn around for me was unfortunately not my idea. But my brains? Not sure what triggered but my highs were no longer relaxing or much enjoyable. I would get paranoia, heart racing, terrible nightmarish thoughts. I knew I had an addiction when even the gruesome highs couldn\u2019t keep me away from wanting more. I\u2019ve been sober for two months. I get cravings consistently. But what helps me is focusing on other things and consistently reminding myself why I\u2019m here. \n\nYou can do it. You\u2019ll look back and see how much of hindrance it was to your life.
