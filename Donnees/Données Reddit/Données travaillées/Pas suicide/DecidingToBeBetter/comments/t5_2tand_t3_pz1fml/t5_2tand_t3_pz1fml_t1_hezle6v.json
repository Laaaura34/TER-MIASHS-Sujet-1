Practically speaking it's pretty straightforward, and you've done the right thing by minimizing daily triggers. However, I would recommend you to be kinder to yourself. Maybe it's just me, but your post reads like a harsh inner voice. Try and stay positive, and remember you're doing this out of love for yourself. There will come a time when refusing an offer to smoke is easier than accepting. Have faith in that, and remember that imperfection is inevitable. Good luck! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz1fml/im_done_abusing_my_brain_and_lungs_im_quitting/hezle6v/"}
