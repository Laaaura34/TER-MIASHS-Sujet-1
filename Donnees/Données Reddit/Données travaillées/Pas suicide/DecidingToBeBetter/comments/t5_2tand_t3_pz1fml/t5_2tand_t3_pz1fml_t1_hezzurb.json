I had endometriosis as well, if you suspect you have it I highly encourage you to join the FB group \"Nancy's nook endometriosis education\". It is run by a retired nurse who also had endometriosis, until it was surgically removed (read; NOT ablated) by the pioneer of the gold standard of endo treatment Dr Redwine.\n\nThe group has a wealth of information provided by specialized endometriosis medical providers, as well as a running list of surgeons worldwide who can successfully perform excision (removal) surgery.\n\nIt is how I found my surgeon Dr mosbrucker, who changed my life for the better. Before my surgery I could barely walk I had so much lower back pain. It has been 3.5 yrs since my surgery and my quality of life is sooooo much better !!!!\n\nAlso if you live in a legal state, try cannabis vaginal suppositories instead of smoking for period pain. They don't get you high and just treat the pain right where it is happening. I know lots of women who swear by it !!\n\nHope this helps and best of luck to you on your health journey", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz1fml/im_done_abusing_my_brain_and_lungs_im_quitting/hezzurb/"}
