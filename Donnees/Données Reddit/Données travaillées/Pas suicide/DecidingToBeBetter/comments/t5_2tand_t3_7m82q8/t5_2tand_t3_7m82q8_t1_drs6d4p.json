It's not until you leave school and your little isolated bubble and get into the real world that you realise how far off the mark they are. \n\nTo be honest it's the curse of the last 'x' many years as there are very few REALLY intelligent people out there, and people grow up to think they are great and can do anything which leads to disappointment when they inevitably don't. \n\nAll you can do is work hard in life and have a bit of luck. Convincing yourself that you are 'intelligent' and can achieve great things is setting yourself up for a fall. Choose something you enjoy and practice it a lot and I'm sure you will make it", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7m82q8/realized_that_intelligence_has_been_obstructing/drs6d4p/"}
