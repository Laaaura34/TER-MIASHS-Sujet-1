The issue isn\u2019t that you need to trick yourself into enjoying activities it\u2019s that you\u2019ve got the wrong idea of what enjoyment is.\n\nYou don\u2019t enjoy an idea. You don\u2019t enjoy a concept or a field or a subject. \n\nYou enjoy tasks. Whatever you\u2019re imagining you want to do and enjoy I\u2019m sure is you getting excited about the idea of something. That\u2019s the wrong way round. Enjoyment comes from the actual doing of a thing and whether that thing activates certain chemicals in your brain. Projects around programming, modding, writing, music etc will involve many tasks some which you\u2019ll enjoy and some which you won\u2019t. But you can\u2019t go off the imagination of enjoyment or the idea of enjoyment.\n\nInstead figure out what actual tasks you enjoy. What thing do you enjoy that when you do it it puts you in a state of flow. That you could do it even if you\u2019re tired or feeling lazy. That when you do it time passes by quickly.\n\nThen construct ideas, activities, hobbies around that", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nro3nb/how_do_i_learn_to_enjoy_a_hobbypassion/h0hugev/"}
