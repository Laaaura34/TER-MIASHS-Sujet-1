My parents are divorcing after nearly 24 years or marriage. I\u2019m 22 and just about to start my senior year of college and I\u2019m panicking because I have no clue what I want to do. Up until the last few months when the divorce news broke, I was thinking I wanted to join my father and work with him. Now I\u2019m seeing that my dad isn\u2019t the person I thought he was and EVERYTHING has been flipped upside down. I\u2019m freaking out that I\u2019ll never find a career I truly love and am happy with. I\u2019d never thought of things from this perspective in the sense that a job can just be a way of making money and achieving happiness/the ability to pursue your passions outside of work. \n\nThanks for the new perspective!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8m0qkd/"}
