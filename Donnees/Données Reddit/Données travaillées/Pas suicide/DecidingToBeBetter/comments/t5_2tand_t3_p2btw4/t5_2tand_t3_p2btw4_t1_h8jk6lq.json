The difference between you and me is that I don\u2019t place my self worth in a career or doing this whole adulthood thing perfectly.\n\nWe grow up learning that you have to do x, y, and z to be \u201csuccessful\u201d, to be happy; that there is a certain way to do things, and that anyone who doesn\u2019t follow that way will be miserable and unfulfilled.

Practice giving yourself compassion as if you were your own best friend in need of support, instead of constantly judging and blaming yourself. Judging and blaming get you nowhere and only make things worse, as you might be aware.\n\nAfter all of that, you still might not know what to do with your life in the future, but you\u2019ll at least know how to live this moment well right now, and the next moment, and the next moment\u2026", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8jk6lq/"}
