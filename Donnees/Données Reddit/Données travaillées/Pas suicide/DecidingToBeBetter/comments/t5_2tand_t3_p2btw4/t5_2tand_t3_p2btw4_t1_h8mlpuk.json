There's no such thing as one true passion.\n\nBut I do believe people have multiple interests. For you, that could be screenwriting. Maybe you moved out of the ghost phase.\n\nBut if you want to give screenwriting a shot (or anything else), just start learning the basics, read the most easiest books on the topic that talk about the basics, watch a few videos, etc. After 15-20 days of doing this, just write, and force yourself to. At first, it'll be shit. But later you'll write some good stuff.\n\nEventually you'll be in a state of \"flow\" where something is not so easy that it gets boring, or so hard that it's super challenging. My goal is to always be in the state of flow, it makes me enjoy doing things, and at the same time keep growing at my craft. Eventually the challenge will (and should) increase, because otherwise you'll get bored.\n\nTry to be in a \"flow state\". Also, most things get very easy once you keep doing it for a few days.\n\nSelect a few things that you think you might enjoy, pick one/two and just start. If you don't enjoy it after 3 months, move to the next \"thing\", until you find something worth your time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8mlpuk/"}
