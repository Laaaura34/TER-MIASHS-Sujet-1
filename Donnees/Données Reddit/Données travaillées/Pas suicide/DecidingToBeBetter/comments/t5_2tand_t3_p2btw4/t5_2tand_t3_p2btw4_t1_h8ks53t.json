Do you want to be able to go on vacation 2x a year? Do you want to have a work life balance? Do you want to serve the public and help people? Do you want to have to look at your bank account before you buy something? Depending on your answers to these questions, you can either get a job that will give you the life you want via a salary, or you can get a job that will give you the life you want as far as work quality. Id start by writing down what your long term goals are and what you want your life to look like in 25 years. From there, back into your calculation on how to get there. \n\nAside from that, you're depressed right now and need to get yourself out of that hole. Id say you need to start doing things to boost your self esteem and get those endorphins going. Its the first step in starting to once again enjoy the things you love.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8ks53t/"}
