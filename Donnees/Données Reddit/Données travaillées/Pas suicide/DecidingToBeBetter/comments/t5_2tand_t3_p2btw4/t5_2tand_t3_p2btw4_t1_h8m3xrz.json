I have had about 5 different careers now. Two were fairly lucrative. Two I changed for health reasons. Now I have a family and I'm doing a new job that isn't really a career because my partner and I decided one of us would be the person who takes time off if a kid is sick or needs a dentist appt. The other would has the more stable career and cash flow.\n\nSo m, you are 30. Say you work till you are 60... 10 years per career area. A good way to change your job without a complete career change is to change the industry you work for. A lot of jobs can translate across to other industries.\n\nSay you live to be 100... you can have lots of interesting and horrible stories of different places you've worked.\n\nThe issue is that you aren't willing to learn from the BAD jobs too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8m3xrz/"}
