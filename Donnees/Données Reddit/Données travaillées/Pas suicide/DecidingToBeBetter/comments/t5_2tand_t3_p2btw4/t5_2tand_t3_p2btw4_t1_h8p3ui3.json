This might have been a truth in the past, especially in large companies, but this isn't true anymore. I am the CEO of a tech startup, this isn't to brag, but rather to tell a story that I hope will be helpful. \n\nThe truth is this. That for the better part of my life I didn't have a calling. I had lots of interests and creative ideas, but nothing that fit into any mold. It was frustrating and at times depressing. It would leave me feeling broken, that I couldn't find a mold that I fit into, and that would be the story of my life.\n\nMy truth, which is mine, and not something for everyone, is that I am a dynamic person, with many interests. I had to invent a position and a company with a mission that reflected my world views. That being said, the journey helped me to find the people that I wanted to be surrounded by and the work that I genuinely wanted to be doing. None of which was easy or without emotional turmoil.\n\nAt the end of the day, life is short. What we invest our time in is the only real choice we will ever have. We all have a calling, that is the divine spark in all of us, it is our gift. But the journey is to have the courage to discover your spark. Most of the time that means you won't fit into a mold, at least not neatly. I hope you find what you are looking for, something that excites you. \n\nI hope this was helpful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8p3ui3/"}
