Nope. But my coworkers are nice, I have tons of flexibility and it pays the bills well.  I can easily do my passions on the side and have the money to do so.\n\nYes this exactly. 31 year old here and over the past couple years my mindset went from \"OMG I'm so stressed because I'm not passionate about what I do for work\" to now being \"A job is what I do to make money, and my passions are my passions\".\n\nThe difference this shift in mindset does is incredible. I leave my work at work, and my weekends and evenings are now mine to do what I love! (Hiking, photography, video games) \n\nOP Don't put so much pressure on making your career your \"dream job\" Many people don't actaully work their dream jon, and a lot of the people that do are lying. Focus on getting a stable job with good people, and pursue screen writing horror movies on the side!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8ktxoc/"}
