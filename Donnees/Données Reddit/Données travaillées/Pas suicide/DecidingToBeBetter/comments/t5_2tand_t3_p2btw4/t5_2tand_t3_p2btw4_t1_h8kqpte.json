Not just summer job money, real money. That only comes with acquiring  valuable skills that transfer into a solid paycheck. You\u2019re right that a career in itself might not provide your sense of worth. You know what does? Your own apartment, a reliable car, a relationship, which is hard to maintain when you live with your parents. Maybe one day own your own house? Kids? Hard to raise them in your parent's house. The world is expensive, and good things cost money. Even mediocre things cost money. There is nothing wrong with not deciding on your career at age 23. When I worked crappy jobs in my 20s, I hated when I'd be at a restaurant with my friends, who all had good jobs. I would always order the cheapest thing and dread when the check arrives because I only had so much money.  I was 31 when I got involved in my career because it was a new industry that didn't exist when I was in college. I absolutely enjoy my career, and it definitely gives me a sense of worth. You have to find the thing that YOU enjoy. I don't believe that anyone enjoys being broke and living with their parents. If they do, good on them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8kqpte/"}
