I tried and failed 3 times. I changed my mind twice before going back to construction. There are college courses I can take that would keep me in the field, but it\u2019s not something Im interested in. In reality, college isn\u2019t for me and it took me a long time to realize it\u2019s okay. Not everyone needs to go to college. I think that too many people go to college for the wrong reasons and most are better off taking an alternative approach to entering the workforce. \n\nI can completely relate to being exhausted from everything. I\u2019m constantly stressed out from work, wondering if I\u2019ll have a job and can pay the mortgage in a month or year from now. Sometimes I\u2019ll feel almost paralyzed  and can\u2019t motivate myself to even was 1 dish in the sink. I think for this you have many options. I\u2019m a terrible writer, but I love having a journal. I try to write a little bit every night and just use it to talk to myself. I write how my day went, what I want to achieve, any problems I have, etc.  \n\nYou can also try therapy. Just having someone to talk to and help put things in perspective can be a huge help. \n\nI think the biggest thing that helped me was when I started asking myself, \u201cwhat\u2019s stopping you?\u201d  I keep asking that to myself until I can no longer come up with an answer. Most of the time the answer is either that I\u2019m getting in my own way or a solution to my problem. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m 32 and I\u2019m finally happy with my direction in life. It took me a long time to get where I am. I always hated that I felt I was behind my peers. I hated that I had to do X because that\u2019s what my family and society expected of me. I\u2019m on my own path now and I\u2019m doing a lot better than I ever expected. It feels really good to say that. I hope you find what works through all these comments and things start to work themselves out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8laa37/"}
