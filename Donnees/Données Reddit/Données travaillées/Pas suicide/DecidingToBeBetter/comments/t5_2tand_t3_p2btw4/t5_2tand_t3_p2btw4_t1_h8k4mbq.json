I used to think like you. I stressed thinking whatever I chose to go to school for or my first major job was needed to be enjoyed because it's what I will do forever. Your career until retirement doesn't need to be 1 job. \n\nI always admired my high school science teacher. He worked on and off at a saw mill after high school, which he enjoyed. Then he was a cable man for over 10 years which he also enjoyed. He then realized his \"calling\" for teaching and went back to school. He then became a teacher, AND he still world at the saw mill in the summer. \n\nStuff will work out man. Dont think 1 job or career path is your forever destiny", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8k4mbq/"}
