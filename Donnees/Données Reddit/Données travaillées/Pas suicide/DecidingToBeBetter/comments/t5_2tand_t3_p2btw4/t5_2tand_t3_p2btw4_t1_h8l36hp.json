I think you should always be progressing your career one way or another. But the reality is as you get older the progression seems to slow down, and depending on the roles you have it\u2019s actually better to stay longer in them.\n\nFor example, I work in tech sales. I started in business development positions when I was 23, and then in account executive position by 26. I\u2019ve been in similar roles like this for the past 6 or 7 years because For me I went through a few company changes trying to figure out the whole passion thing and also what kind of company and leader I want to work for. I\u2019ve now found a great company, it\u2019s small in size which I enjoy better than a large one, and I progress my role but building out the roles I\u2019m in, with the goal of becoming a manager and hiring my own reps in the next year or so.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to work extra hours to progress your career. I believe 8 hour days are enough time for you to get your required job responsibilities done and have additional time to add some more value in other areas. If not, then you\u2019re either not using your time wisely or the responsibilities are just unrealistic.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8l36hp/"}
