All the shit that\u2019s going on in your head. You\u2019ll find little gems and epiphanies that\u2019ll help you kind of break things down and realize that you\u2019re over complicating things. I wrote down a list what my values are. None of them had anything to do with success or having money. All of ours will be different but I think for most people the things that really matter aren\u2019t material things or getting ahead in life, they\u2019re more about appreciation of what we have now and making the best of whatever situation we\u2019re in. We\u2019ve all gotta have goals of course but at the same time we can\u2019t be consumed by them. It\u2019s all about finding a healthy balance. I\u2019m only 28 and I don\u2019t make a lot of money but I enjoy what I do right now and I\u2019m not too worried about what the future holds because no matter what happens I know it\u2019ll be okay and I\u2019ll figure it out like I always have. I don\u2019t let fear rule over me like I used to. Just go with the flow, figure out what it is you\u2019d like to do and work towards it", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8l6wlg/"}
