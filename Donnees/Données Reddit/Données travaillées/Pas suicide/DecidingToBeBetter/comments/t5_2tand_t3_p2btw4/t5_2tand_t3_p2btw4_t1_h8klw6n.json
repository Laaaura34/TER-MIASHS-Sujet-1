And that's ok.\n\nThere's a lot of things I can do. And that's because I've tried my hands at a number of different things while looking for a path.\n\nTurns out, that path of 'multiple paths' has paid off. When I was in my 20's and wanted to party, I became a DJ. I finished university with an Arts degree and wanted to travel, so I became an ESL teacher. When I got tired of that and wanted stability and a home, I learned Geographic Information Systems. When my wife was sick, I became a stay at home dad. When she started getting better, I was only able to go part-time,  so I found contract work. Covid hit, I started distilling. \n\nWho knows what the future will bring, and I'm only in my 50's!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8klw6n/"}
