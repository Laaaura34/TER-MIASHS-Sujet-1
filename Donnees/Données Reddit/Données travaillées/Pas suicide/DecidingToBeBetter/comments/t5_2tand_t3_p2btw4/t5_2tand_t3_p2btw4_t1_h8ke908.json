I did a film and media studies degree at uni, wanted to be involved in the industry. The reality was that I just didn\u2019t have my head in it, I was worried about being someone and succeeding to the point that I could never relax and just do the next thing. Created a lot of stress, a couple of depressive episodes and general misery. \n\nI\u2019d worked loads of jobs over the years to support myself, but never committed to them because I never really wanted to be there. Wasn\u2019t until my late 20\u2019s that I gave up trying to be somebody or something, and started putting effort in to what was in front of me. \n\nNow a manage a nice restaurant, I try to be supportive of people around me, I put effort in to the job without stressing about it. I\u2019ve given up being so hard on myself and trying to be something else to the point that I appreciate what I\u2019m doing now. I have better relationships, and I\u2019m generally happy. \n\nFunny thing is that now I write a little bit. Couldn\u2019t do it for shit before, but since I chilled the fuck out and stopped putting so much pressure on myself, my passion was still there waiting for me. \n\nI don\u2019t want to call bullshit on some of the other comments here, because I\u2019m sure some of the advice is helpful to some. But for me, I couldn\u2019t drag myself to do something before I was ready. I\u2019m in my early 30\u2019s now and I feel like I have loads of time to change careers if that\u2019s really what I want to do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8ke908/"}
