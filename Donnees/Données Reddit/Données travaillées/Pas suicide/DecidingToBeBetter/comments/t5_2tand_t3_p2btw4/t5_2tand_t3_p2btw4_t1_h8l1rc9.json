About 2 weeks after turning thirty I got a well anticipated promotion in my job where I was told on average I\u2019d make about $150k. The problem was it was all commission. No problem, I\u2019ve work all commission in the same company the last two years. I can handle it. Fast forward almost 8 months now, it\u2019s a nightmare. All my savings are gone. I haven\u2019t made diddly squat with the promotion- no one in this position really did this year and it\u2019s no ones fault it\u2019s just the market we\u2019re in not being as opportunistic this year. \n\nANYWAY I don\u2019t just want to sympathize with you. I actually kinda want to yell at you a little bit. The problem isn\u2019t that you don\u2019t know what you want to do. The problem is you lack discipline (wrack a disaprine). You can do SOMETHING. You just haven\u2019t. You could get your creative writing degree or you could just write and edit on your own but you haven\u2019t, and again I\u2019m not being mean here but, YOU LACK DISCIPLINE. That\u2019s all you need. Get into a habit. Make a schedule. Have some focus in your life. Knowing what you want to be forever is not going to change your life - look at me I thought I\u2019d make $200k this year and in a company I\u2019d be in for 5-10 years. That\u2019s all very different now. Ok end rant. Lmk if you want another swift kick in the pants or just to talk", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8l1rc9/"}
