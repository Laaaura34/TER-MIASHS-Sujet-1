As long as you come in with a good attitude, accomplish the tasks assigned to you, are friendly with your colleagues and have a genuine desire to do right by your customers then you\u2019re killing it. That is really the high bar. When I first learned that I found it depressing.\n\nI always wanted to be on a team that was full of fire, changing the world, and building something I could me mega passionate about. But at the end of the day, in the quiet of my heart, it\u2019s way more important to me to be able to save some money, spend time with family, and get some hobbies. \n\nA job is a piece of your life, it is not your whole life. Find a team that is full of kind people who care about their work, a product line that is at least mildly interesting, ideally in a high margin industry, and keep it to 9-5.\n\nAs for the adulting concerns, I\u2019ll level with you, when people leave home they don\u2019t have a clue what is going on. They figure it out as they go and their confidence grows over time. I didn\u2019t know how to open a bank account, get a credit card, pay my water bill, haggle a new agreement for an apartment, ask for a raise, etc etc none of it. But 4 years later I feel like I\u2019m getting the hang of things. It wasn\u2019t always smooth, the answers weren\u2019t always clear but I\u2019m getting the hang of it. Don\u2019t put pressure on yourself to \u201cadult\u201d. Instead understand what needs to happen next, what you need to know/get/do to do it, then execute on that single step. Over and over. You\u2019ll wake up one day and realize you\u2019re pretty content and that was what you were looking for the whole time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8j133l/"}
