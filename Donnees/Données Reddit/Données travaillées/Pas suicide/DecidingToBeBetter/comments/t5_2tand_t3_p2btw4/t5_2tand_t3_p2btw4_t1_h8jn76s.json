There was a brief time when I was in a careery job and settled down in the way society tends to expect us to. And honestly? I was miserable. \n\nIt felt like, okay, I did all the things I was supposed to do... now what?? I just keep doing what I'm doing for the next few decades and occasionally get a pay rise? That made me feel unbearably trapped, and also like I couldn't grow in the ways I wanted to as a person.\n\nI quit the job I was in (and the relationship, but that's not relevant to your post) and now I'm in a job I love; but I'm totally happy if I'm not in this job forever. As long as the job I'm in is satisfying, challenging and engaging in various ways I don't mind what the job role is. I'm going to have different needs at different times in my life and staying in the same career pathway forever doesn't appeal to me.\n\nI dunno, I guess I feel like our lives are made up of so many different parts that are constantly ebbing and flowing. I want to be proud of the life I've lived and the person I am. As long as I can live and pay my bills and provide for myself and anybody in my care, I can live a joyful and fulfilling life. I can be flexible and adventurous and in tune with my own mental health and changing needs as I age and grow as a person. \n\nAll I can do is make the next right decision for each stage of my life. I'm happy with that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8jn76s/"}
