Don\u2019t be so down on yourself because you\u2019ve been wasting time smoking weed and masturbating. Your life hasn\u2019t even started yet! \n\nYou remind me of my best friend. At the age of 17/18 he also realized that doing drugs and masturbating is just a big waste of time. We still have the occasional talk where he regrets not doing anything productive in high school like building social skills and trying out new hobbies, but I always remind him that there are people who are in their 20s and 30s still jerking off and smoking weed, living in their parent\u2019s house with a dead-end job. \n\nBe grateful that you figured this out at the perfect age. Who cares if you wasted a year or two with your addictions. You stopped at the perfect age where your testosterone is settling down after puberty. \n\nLife is all about failing and learning. You MUST fail to become successful. The ones who are successful are the ones that learned and adapted. \n\nYou, my friend, are adapting.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7ri5p0/quitting_masturbating_for_3_days_more_than/dsxl4hr/"}
