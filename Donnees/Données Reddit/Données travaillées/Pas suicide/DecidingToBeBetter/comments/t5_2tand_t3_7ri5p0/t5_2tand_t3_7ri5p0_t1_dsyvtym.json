Just look at some \"benefits\" posts. Holy fucking shit the delusion levels are off the charts. \"I stopped masturbating and I now can control the weather with my mind\". Stupid shit like that. On top of that you have these young kids who think that masturbating is the reason that their lives are fucked up and that they're horrible people for beating their meat and the only way to solve ALL their problems is absolute, religious, celibacy. Calling someone out on their bullshit gets you down voted. It's like The_Donald, just about masturbating.\n\nAgain, fuck that place with a goddamn cactus.
