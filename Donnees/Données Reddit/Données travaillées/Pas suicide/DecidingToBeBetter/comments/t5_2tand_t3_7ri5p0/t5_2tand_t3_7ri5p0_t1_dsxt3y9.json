In my opinion, you shouldn't watch porn at all since you feel as though it is a problem in your life. I'm not saying you're 100% addicted and that porn will ruin your life. But since a little voice in your head is telling you it's a destructive habit it means that you should stop. \n\nIt's honestly pretty difficult though. I just relapsed today after a few weeks on NoFap. The key for me is to just not feel ashamed when it happens because it will happen. When you feel the urge to watch porn just remember how fleeting the pleasure is and that you're going to feel worse after you finish. I like to either play a video game to take my mind off of it or watch a youtube video of Terry Crews talk about overcoming his porn addiction. \n\nTry not to feel any shame about this. More guys deal with this same issue than you think. I remember bringing up my issue with my friends in college and I was amazed that some of them opened up about having the same issue.
