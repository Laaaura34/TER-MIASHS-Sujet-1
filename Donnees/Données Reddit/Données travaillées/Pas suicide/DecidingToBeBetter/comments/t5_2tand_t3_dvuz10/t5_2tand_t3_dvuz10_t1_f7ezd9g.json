But instead of writing, for me its painting and visual arts. My family and teachers have been impressed with my talent ever since I was young, I earned an award for Sixth form art & design in my previous school, won 'Next Michelangelo' in prom, got A\\*s  from year 7 all the way A Levels.\n\nBut now that I'm in university doing Arts, something just makes me unmotivated to create art pieces and leave them to the very very last minute (I saw my first F a few weeks ago because I have the same problem of turning in). Maybe it's because I know that I'm great at it,  it's caused me to underestimate how hard it would be to create a piece if I leave it to the last minute. Maybe because now I see other students making excellent pieces, my creativity decreased and insecurity increased. I dont know why I do but I keep turning in works on the last day of the extended deadline. I even made myself some promises every beginning of a semester. but maybe I'm just the worst at keeping even my own promises.\n\nAnyways great to see that I'm not the only one here (not that I'm proud of my situation).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvuz10/cant_graduate_without_passing_professional/f7ezd9g/"}
