A lot of the appeal of characters like this is *that* we\u2019re not born like them. And because even people like them have their moments of raw, ugly, unadulterated humanness\u2014which itself adds to the beauty of it all.\n\nSparing you my entire life story, I\u2019ve been in some rough patches. And I can say with full certainty that the good comes *in addition to* the bad, not excluding or in spite of the bad. The weather was nice, yes; but the day still sucked, and that\u2019s still valid. Because we frustrate ourselves more when we try to filter out those feelings. And happiness doesn\u2019t always have to be good feelings. \n\nI personally like to make it a game and look for something specific. Sometimes when I go out, I look for colors I think are pretty; or cool ways light reflects off of surfaces; or in nature I\u2019ll pay extra attention to the shapes of the leaves, or I\u2019ll look out for interesting bugs. I also find it helpful to empathize with these details. Maybe a color or shape reminds you of your childhood, or a loved one. Or maybe those bugs have their own friends and family. \n\n\nThese are just a couple ideas, though. My point is that when you actively focus on the little details, you start to see them in a new light. And you realize just how many awesome things you\u2019ve been missing. \n\nBy no means am I an expert on this, but I wanted to share what I\u2019ve learned so far! And I hope it\u2019s helpful for you :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/htrx05/i_want_to_see_the_world_through_joe_peras_eyes_i/fyiu4o9/"}
