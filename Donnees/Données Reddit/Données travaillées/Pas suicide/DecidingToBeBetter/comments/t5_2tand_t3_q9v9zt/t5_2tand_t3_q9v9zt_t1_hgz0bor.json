To me it seems it would include self care and acting on your values (among other things). One of my personal values is growth and sometimes it seems like its conflicting with the 'accept yourself the way you are' thing - Especially when the things that I am are opposite of my goals. Sometimes it helps to think that I can accept the way I am as a mid stop because I know I will be better tomorrow and the next day and so on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9v9zt/can_it_be_considered_self_love_even_if_i_want_to/hgz0bor/"}
