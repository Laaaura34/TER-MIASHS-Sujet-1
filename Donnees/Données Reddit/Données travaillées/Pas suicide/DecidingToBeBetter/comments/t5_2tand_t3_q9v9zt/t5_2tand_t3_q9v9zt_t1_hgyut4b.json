Loving yourself largely includes treating yourself with respect. \n\nIf body-building interests you, then go for it! If therapy, or counseling helps your mental health, get after it! Mindset is key. Keep a close eye on your mental health. Most things that are bad for us, have a negative effect, in that department. \n\nBe you. Stay strong. Stay happy.
