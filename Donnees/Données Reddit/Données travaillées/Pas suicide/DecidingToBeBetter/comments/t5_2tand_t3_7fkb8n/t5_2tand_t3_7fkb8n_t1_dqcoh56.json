What I have done is had to look inside myself. I meditated on it.  I mean this literally. Try meditation, it will focus your brain. Then, once you feel some kind of mental change, think about what your really really want. You could say now that you don't care. But that is not really true. Would you care say if a good friend died, a close family member, a pet, or even just a random person. We all have some sort of care inside us. Yes, even something not as negative and extreme as death can get us to care. Think about what your happy place would be. Even if you think that place is unreachable, just think on it. Eventually you will find something to move towards. And once you start towards that goal, a goal to give meaning or at least a frame to your life, you will start to feel better. That at least has been my experience so far.\nStay strong good sir. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7fkb8n/does_anyone_have_any_tips_on_dealing_with_apathy/dqcoh56/"}
