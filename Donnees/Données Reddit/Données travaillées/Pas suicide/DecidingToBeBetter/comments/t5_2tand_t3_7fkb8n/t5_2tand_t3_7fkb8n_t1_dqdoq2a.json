What are your thoughts on feeling apathetic towards mundane, everyday work items vs. big picture life goals/situations? For example, I\u2019m definitely interested in meditating - however how do you yourself curb the feeling of apathy in small work tasks (eg. an email comes in from a panicky colleague who is having an issue with something; often times I just can\u2019t wrap my head around how this is actually a panic situation and that there are much bigger fish to fry - I could be right, but it doesn\u2019t help the situation if I can\u2019t at least try and see the item through their eyes)?\n\nAlso, I just read some of your past comments/posts. Please know that you\u2019re not worthless. You\u2019ve just provided immense help to a complete stranger that is conceivably 1000\u2019s of miles away from you. I appreciate your words, and they have provided me tremendous worth in a time of struggle. Thank you for that!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7fkb8n/does_anyone_have_any_tips_on_dealing_with_apathy/dqdoq2a/"}
