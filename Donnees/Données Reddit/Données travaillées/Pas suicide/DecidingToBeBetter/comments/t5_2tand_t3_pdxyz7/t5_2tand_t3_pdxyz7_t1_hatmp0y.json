I decided that if I didn't do the thing I've loved since I was a child I'll always regret it.\n\nI deleted all social media (apart from reddit) to stop comparing my art to others. I only have Pinterest to find inspiration and references. Since then I've found I enjoy making set much more. \n\nIt's still a bit of a struggle but focus on your own art and how YOU want it to look. Some of the greatest artist of our time didn't start making art until they were much older than you (Monet in his 30's, Van Gogh in his late 20's, Carmen Hererra sold her first piece at 89!).\n\nRemember art isn't a race. Every piece of art you make, even if you hate it, is a step closer to being the artist you want to be. Prove to yourself that YOU can do it, it doesn't matter if others think it's good or bad.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdxyz7/i_want_to_learn_and_get_back_to_making_art_but_i/hatmp0y/"}
