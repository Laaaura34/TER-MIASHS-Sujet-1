Your life hasn\u2019t even really begun yet. \n\nThere may not be a secret to life but if there is one it\u2019s this: Spend the limited time you have in life on things that match what you find valuable to you. If something has enough value to you personally, you do it. What other people can do or what they will think of you if you do something is completely unimportant and a waste of time to think about.  \n\nThere will always be someone who is more talented and better at everything that you can do. That has no bearing on what *you* should do. If you always guide what you do by whatever everyone else does, you\u2019ll always be a copy of someone else and never become the best you that you can be. That\u2019s no way to live.  Live on your own terms. Be the success you want to be.
