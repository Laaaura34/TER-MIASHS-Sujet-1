I thought I was bad freaking out about age nearly 30 but is this what actual teenagers are doing now? Wow. I think we as a society have too much time on our hands. How are you going to handle life as you get older? You realise you have another 70 years ahead of you? How is your life going to be if you think you're already too old to go for what you want?. I would love to be 19 again. Wow. I was such a child compared to now. And I'm sure someone in their late 30s/40s looks at me and thinks the exact same. There's some 80/90s years olds taking up new hobbies, acting, doing weights etc for the first time. Your life will go on whether you partake to change it or not so go for your dreams so you don't end up looking back with regret.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdxyz7/i_want_to_learn_and_get_back_to_making_art_but_i/hauhaez/"}
