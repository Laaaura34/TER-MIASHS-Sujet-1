I know you\u2019ve probably heard this a million times, but have you considered an active activity to do? It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the gym, for me it was rock climbing! It\u2019s the one time of day I put down my phone for as long as I\u2019m there and it\u2019s just me and the rocks. All the endorphins are amazing and it\u2019s the perfect amount of me time. Just something to consider, but by all means don\u2019t change up your routine if it\u2019s working wonders for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ag87jz/i_set_up_a_routine_and_its_helping_me_feeling/ee4q3na/"}
