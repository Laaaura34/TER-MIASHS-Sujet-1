And since I don't have any obligations at the moment (taking a break from uni and living with my parents) I just decided I'd let myself wake up naturally. I usually fail to wake up early unless I have some obligations like going to a class or job, I thought that just waking up when I felt like it would be better, specifically to avoid that failing sensation straight up in the morning. Why wake up early, if I get to do all the things I want to do during the day anyways, what's the point of forcing myself and making myself feel bad? I really need a purpose to do stuff for myself and atm waking up early wouldn't bring me much so I just didn't put it in my routine. \nI'll probs try and include waking up early a few weeks before going back to uni just to get used to it again but for now I'm very happy with waking up at 11am ahah.\nHave a good one as well!
