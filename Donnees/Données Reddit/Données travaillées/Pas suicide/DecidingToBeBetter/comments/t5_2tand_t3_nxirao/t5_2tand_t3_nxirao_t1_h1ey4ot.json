It actually really is a big deal that you\u2019re moving in the right direction!\n-start small, start sustainable. Going to the gym every day for an hour is too big of a step and isn\u2019t sustainable. Going for a 10-minute walk twice a week is a much better place to start.\n-focus on what\u2019s going right instead of what\u2019s wrong. Example: I used to work at a summer camp that had an archery range. One day a cabin of 10 year old girls was practicing on the range and a rabbit hopped in front of the target. Because the girls were focusing on DONT HIT THE RABBIT, guess what happened? They shot and killed the rabbit. Moral of the story: if you\u2019re focusing too much on the bad, you\u2019ll hit the wrong target\n-build a support system. It sounds like you\u2019re doing some of this already! Seek out counseling services, too - trained pros will be able to help you more accurately. You don\u2019t need to hang out with people you haven\u2019t seen in years, but maybe just reaching out to them electronically to see what they\u2019ve been doing in their lives is a small enough step that you\u2019ll feel connected without triggering too much anxiety\n-keep track of your progress. Try to write down positive steps, like \u201cate an apple instead of a donut today\u201d or \u201ctook a shower.\u201d I\u2019m a teacher so I don\u2019t work for a few weeks in the summer, and my mental health goes down the toilet unless I keep a daily list of those kinds of things. Otherwise I start to feel like shit. But having a daily list is super useful, because I can remind myself that I did something good every day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nxirao/please_help_me_help_myself_to_do_better_feedback/h1ey4ot/"}
