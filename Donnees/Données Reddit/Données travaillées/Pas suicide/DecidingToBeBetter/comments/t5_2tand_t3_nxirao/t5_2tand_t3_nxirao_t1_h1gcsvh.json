I know a lot of people with mental health issues (I\u2019m also one of them) and my brother is a social worker so he has seen a lot, too. Something to keep in mind is that some of the drugs you took are appetite suppressants/metabolism boosters, so gaining weight without changing how you eat or exercise might actually be a good indicator of living cleaner. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen those before/after pictures of people addicted to stuff like meth - they look like skeletons. There actually probably are support groups like that - I\u2019d be willing to bet there are some on Reddit, Facebook, etc. It\u2019s just a matter of finding them sometimes. No self-respecting counselor/psychologist would think you\u2019re a lost cause or think you\u2019re making stuff up. They see things like this (and worse!) literally every day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nxirao/please_help_me_help_myself_to_do_better_feedback/h1gcsvh/"}
