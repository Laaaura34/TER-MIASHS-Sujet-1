I can\u2019t thank you enough really. To you this is just taking a few mins out of your day to help someone, but to me this is really life altering and a really big deal as you know. Thanks for the props on me moving forward. I guess I shouldn\u2019t be mad at all your right, it\u2019s just I wanted to be a lot further now. That was yesterday. \n\nYou understand that working out for 10 mins a day consistently is something big for someone in my situation. I do feel though that I dug myself out of a hole so deep that I never thought I would. I\u2019m making my way out. Old patterns almost through. I know I don\u2019t have to answer to you although my God I have so many defaults. For f*ck sake I realized while writing this that I was letting you know that I wasn\u2019t that bad off, but still bad off. Ie\u2026off the ledge looking down. I don\u2019t know you, but you took the time to write this means so much. The little things in life are so big now. \nI don\u2019t talk to any old friends \u201cdrug buddies\u201d at all. Side note. Was at a friends house 6 years ago high out of my mind on adderall. No idea how she didn\u2019t know. I came clean with everyone because I know people were thinking and I\u2019m not going to be someone who is hiding from these mistakes I\u2019m\nGoing to help people and some people got a few things from me. So it was amazing us hanging out like two years ago. \n(  now plans after covid ) no big deal just a friend who doesn\u2019t judge me ( one of\nThose one of a kind friends ) I realized I have so much support which is so amazing ) they don\u2019t understand me like you do or half this page. As far as a support system. Well\u2026.I have two lady friends ( gfs sound funny ) both of them are just amazing ( the priceless ones ) one I\u2019ve never met before ( I will be in the future a year or more when I\u2019m ready ) and the other one someone I was basically attached to from the hip. \n\nHere\u2019s where my problem is\u2026.( just 1 right ) I told one of them, the one I was so close to that I had a relapse and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t talk for the last month. I did slip on a couple pills but not to where I would\u2026.basically I lied to her and told her I relapsed the last 3 months and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t text etc. I just needed to be alone. Being accountable is a huge problem for me as well. ( before\nI finish this message I just need to thank you again, going to screen shot it & or email it\nto myself. I have gotten very very sound advice like this before. Basically though I said the same thing as far as what I\u2019m going\nTo do. For f*ck sake when I stopped all the drugs I proper turned into a cow. I went from 185 to 260 in 2 years. ( not bragging lol ) anyway I just lost 30 lbs as well. \n\nIt\u2019s just one thing after another as you see. So I\u2019m going to use your response as literally my reminder. I\u2019ll figure out how to make it up to where it\u2019s somewhere accessible quick on my phone and it will remind me that I don\u2019t have to do this overnight. \n\nFamily members of drug addicts are 6 months behind an addict ( I\u2019m told ) so my sister, Mom whomever sees me as I was 6 months ago. I have to say that\u2019s so on point because without the weight loss I am exactly the same as then. \n\nLately though my thinking is what I\u2019m struggling with. I\u2019m inpatient. That\u2019s the \u201cdruggie mentality\u201d that he\u2019s I can change but it does define me now. Making things up to friends because I\u2019d rather take a nap. \n\nWow I\u2019ve had it with that. I just decided I\u2019m not going to be making things up at all anymore. It\u2019s so pointless, it\u2019s not who I am, and it\u2019s the easy way out. Some friends I have are sort of clingy and I think it\u2019s my fault. \n\nWow I went way off topic here mate. If you were to here my story from 18 until now you\u2019d feel like you are reading or watching a movie. I\u2019ve been to prison ( at 17 for being a teenager ) which to me is having a few friends break into an apartment with keys in the door. So I drank a few of this guys beer. If I\u2019d not have admitted it to the police or new my rights I\u2019d have gotten probation and wouldn\u2019t have done 14 months in a 17-100 year old prison. \n\nI\u2019m finally reconnecting with my daughter who is my life, it\u2019s been 5 years since I seen my baby girl 21 years old!!! Never too late but that\u2019s another thing. This is why I can\u2019t post in just an anxiety group or a recovery group. I just wish there was a community called you fcked up your life big time and now your fixing it. ( basically you got through the hard part and now your stuck ) \n\nA 10 minute walk per day-Ez-Pz. \nShower a day.                     \u201c\u201d \u201c\u201d\n\nI think It\u2019s time for the counseling and back\nto my AA meetings. The way AA works is set up for someone to help another person who needs help and that\u2019s how he stays sober. \nIt\u2019s like an AA lifestyle. I see a psychiatrist. In 24 years I\u2019ve never had a counselor or psychologist. There\u2019s literally not enough hours in the day for me to explain everything that has happened and I been through. I will deffo go to one but It\u2019s almost a lost cause. They\u2019d probably think I\u2019m literally making things up. No clue how I\u2019m not dead right now. I mean that should be enough right there I get it. \u201cNormal\u201d people ( thank GOD I\u2019m not ) would just be shocked. I mean nothing cynical or bad but I was an idiot and addict for years. \n\nI think something you wrote in there made me realize I\u2019m trying to do this over night. \n\nSeriously thanks again. I\u2019m not sure too\nMuch how Reddit works, less then a year on here trying to support or ask, but hope to bump into you again. I can tell right off the bat your one of the good ones. \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude4f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nxirao/please_help_me_help_myself_to_do_better_feedback/h1f34f1/"}
