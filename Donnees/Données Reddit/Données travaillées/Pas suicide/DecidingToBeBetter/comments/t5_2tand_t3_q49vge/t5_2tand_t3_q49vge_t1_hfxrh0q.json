When you get your degree they will be about the same as they are now, 3 years is not a lot of time to age. \n\n\nI actually think reflecting on your parents death is a part of becoming an adult, a man, independent. You need to process that your parents are not eternal, and you need to step up at some point and be your own leader, and that's exactly what you are doing right now. It's good.\n\n\nYour fear of being alone is very valid, because it is not good to be alone. So you should try to plan so that you will not be alone. Get in shape, be kind, be as respectful to women as you would a man, get your degree. I'm sure you can find someone to marry. Try to be happy, because women love happy men. \n\n\nYour parents will die, but probably of old age, and not in the next 5 years. Plenty of time to become a good, strong man. \n\n\nTry not to dwell in these thought too much, remember to have fun. But i think this process is healthy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q49vge/confusion_about_what_would_i_do_without_my_parents/hfxrh0q/"}
