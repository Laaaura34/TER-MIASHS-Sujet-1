Watching and caring for someone as they die is hard work. I disagree with your reasoning. I would have loved to read how an in home care specialist could make 6+ (7?,8?) figure income in a year. I would have loved to read about how he bought a house with the money he earned, within a 3 year period. That is not what happened. Not even close. Granted it's also not the strawman example you gave. But, it's still a story of inheritance. My problem with the story is: What's the takeaway? How is this story supposed to motivate? How can I apply what he learned to my life? What would have happened if his friend didn't die, or promise him a windfall, would he still have been in the same position? How is he overcoming his depression?\n\nI'm not trying to diminish the guys hard work, or say he didn't earn it. In fact his hard work isn't finished IMO. I wouldn't mind reading a follow up about how he deals with estate, income, and property tax. A motivational story about being a land owner, while (I'm assuming) being part of the working poor. That would be a story that motivates me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bgtlkt/3_years_ago_i_made_a_decision_to_move_out_of_my/elsbr5x/"}
