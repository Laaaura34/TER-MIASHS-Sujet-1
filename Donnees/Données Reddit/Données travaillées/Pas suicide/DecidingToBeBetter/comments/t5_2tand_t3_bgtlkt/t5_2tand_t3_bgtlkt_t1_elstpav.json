It was usually one person with him, whether it be me, or his brother who was a great help, and my friend who I hired, and usually one hospice nurse and one CNA aide, although the aides didn't come daily, it was hit or miss with them. Hospice nurse was usually there for about 40-60 minutes. Aide would arrive after, maybe every other day or 2 out of 3 days. He would usually not consent to a sponge cleansing of some kind. He would try to get out of it as often as he could because the water made him cold, poor guy was skin and bone. I'd do morning and night routine, and he woke me during the night a hell of a lot, I had a baby monitor I'd listen for him on that. He woke me a lot even though he was on ambien. Not to mention the morphine and Ativan. We had essentially a bare-bones crew for the level of care he needed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bgtlkt/3_years_ago_i_made_a_decision_to_move_out_of_my/elstpav/"}
