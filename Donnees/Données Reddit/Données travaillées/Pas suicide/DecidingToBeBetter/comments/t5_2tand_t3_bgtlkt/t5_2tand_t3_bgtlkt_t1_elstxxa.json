I stayed home for 9 days, didn't leave the room for 9 fucking days after he had a bad fall. I had caught him a few times before but that last time he went down fast. I was just feet away, couldn't catch him, we thought he broke his hip and I didn't leave his side for 9 days. I thought it was imminent, that he may have internal bleeding or something. I watched him closely. He lasted for a full 3 months after that. Didn't walk at all after that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bgtlkt/3_years_ago_i_made_a_decision_to_move_out_of_my/elstxxa/"}
