I don't have alot of advice otherwise I'd be taking it too, but there is this stuff called delta 8 weed and it's legal (here in jers idk where you're at)  and you can order it on the internet and that has helped a couple of my friends slowly come off of weed.  It looks and tastes the same but it's a little harsher of a hit and it makes you feel high without all the psychoactive effects like paranoia and anxiety(I think of it as those sugar pills for people who need to take daily meds so they don't fall out of routine, definitely a placebo effect as well).   Maybe it'll help maybe it won't but it would be something worth looking into if I were you.  I have a link for a good website that has it if you wanna dm me.  Good luck hope this helps \ud83d\udc4d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/njkhj7/realizing_ive_never_found_who_i_am_because/gz879pt/"}
