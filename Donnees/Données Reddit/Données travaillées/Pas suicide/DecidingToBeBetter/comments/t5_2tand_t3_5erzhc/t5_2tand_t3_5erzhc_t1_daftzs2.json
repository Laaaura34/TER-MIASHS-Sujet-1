When I rediscovered it years later I was ready.  \n\nThe podcast was a catalysts for serious change in my life.  It started out as wanting to be better with women,  and became about personal growth in general.  \n\nI am a much more genuine person now,  more comfortable socially,  and really just a happier person.  \n\nCan not recommend enough.  \n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5erzhc/the_art_of_charm_a_great_podcast_that_could/daftzs2/"}
