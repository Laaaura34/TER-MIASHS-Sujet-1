Nothing is amateur in art. YOU JUST CREATE. You\u2019re not selling anything or competing. Just let it flow. ~~~~~~ \n\nI can\u2019t paint anything specific like people or landscapes, so I do abstract art that looks like a bunch of nothing lol. But it\u2019s fun!!!!\n\n\nEdit: it\u2019s also like pictures. One of my paintings I still look back on and remember my last break up (I painted it while I was going through a break up). It\u2019s good to see the memories of who I was when I was creating it", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oorkq3/whatre_some_funcreative_hobbies_to_get_into_from/h60thzx/"}
