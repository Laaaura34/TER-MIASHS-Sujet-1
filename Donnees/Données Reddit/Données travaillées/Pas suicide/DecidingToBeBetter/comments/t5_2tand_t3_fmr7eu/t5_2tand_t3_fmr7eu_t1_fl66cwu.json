Becoming more honest with myself first about what is challenging for me, instead of living in a state of denial and judgment toward myself, has led me to be able to face which areas exactly I need to work on and realize the courage to show up and act in spite of my fear/s, in practical ways which over time are building up and producing positive change in my life. Yay!! Now to stay consistent\n\nThanks for sharing\ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fmr7eu/the_light_is_too_painful_for_someone_who_wants_to/fl66cwu/"}
