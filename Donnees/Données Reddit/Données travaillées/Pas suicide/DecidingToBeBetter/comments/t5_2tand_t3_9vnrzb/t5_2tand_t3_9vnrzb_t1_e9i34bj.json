Basically living 100% and creating something that makes others live 100%... experience life in it's truest form.\n\nI'm hoping to create that... maybe it will be through another medium other than music, but basically that's what I've had in my mind", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9vnrzb/in_awe_of_those_who_work_doing_what_they_love/e9i34bj/"}
