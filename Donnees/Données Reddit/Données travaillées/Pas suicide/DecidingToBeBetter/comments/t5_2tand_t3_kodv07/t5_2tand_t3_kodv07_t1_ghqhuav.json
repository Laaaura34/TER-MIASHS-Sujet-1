I am such a perfectionist that I can\u2019t just \u2018noodle around on the guitar\u2019.  I have to do stuff like - take weekly lessons that I have to keep up with and travel to and from my teacher every week.  That was years ago, and now that I\u2019m actually really good at the guitar and don\u2019t need lessons, I have to write and record albums that I post on the internet.  And I feel guilty when I haven\u2019t posted a new single in a long time.  Yes I am that crazy.  I can\u2019t just sit down and put on a guided meditation and just chill on the couch - I have to read a ton of books about Buddhism and mindfulness and feel guilty when my app says I skipped a day.\n\nI have to break out of this pattern because it is inevitably destructive (see my post below) - but at the same time I have responsibilities that I have to maintain.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kodv07/how_much_downtime_does_a_person_need/ghqhuav/"}
