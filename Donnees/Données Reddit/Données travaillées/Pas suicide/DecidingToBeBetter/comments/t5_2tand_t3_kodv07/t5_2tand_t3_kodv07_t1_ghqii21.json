Hmm, that\u2019s a tough one. I understand, that both your main work and your side business are fairly enjoyable. Maybe you could try to decrease time spent on unenjoyable activities such as meetings, or maybe that\u2019s not possible.\n\nMy main takeaway from your reply is, that you\u2019re balancing on an edge of sorts, where you try not to fall into medical problems or burnout. That in it self sounds pretty unhealthy. Also, you seem to prioritize your family highly. It could be a good idea to speak with them to hear what brings them most value. Imagine if they actually felt, that they\u2019d rather have you happy, working 40 hrs a week, spending a lot of time with them, while living on a lot less than now.\n\nGood luck with it, and bear in mind, that i know pretty much nothing of your situation. I hope that my reply brings something that can help with a perspective on something.\n\nEDIT: I also understand, that things in the US are very different than the rest of the world, and that you might actually have to work 70+ hrs a week in order to uphold a reasonable life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kodv07/how_much_downtime_does_a_person_need/ghqii21/"}
