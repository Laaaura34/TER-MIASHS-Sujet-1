You will have good days/ distracted reading the same line over and over days. Furthermore it doesn\u2019t help that the required reading for some classes is just \u201cthe teacher published this awful textbook and if we don\u2019t make the kids buy it no one will\u201d. \n\nBeing dyslexic, I used to go to study skills sessions at my uni, and I used to wonder why this stuff wasn\u2019t universally taught.  I think I heard somewhere that most adults read at lower than middle school level\u2026. Which is both surprising and unsurprising at the same time.\n\nThere are probably tons of resources on YouTube and stuff but i would also reach out to your college student services, department, specific instructors etc because everyone has different advice and methods \u2026 you never know what you might learn\u2026 and some techniques work better for certain classes or types of material. Maybe your classmates can share notes and discuss the reading, just finding ways to interact with the material so it goes beyond note taking and highlighting. \n\nBottom line is, you can improve, and it\u2019s definitely worth the effort to learn new techniques.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmfa82/struggling_with_reading_and_retaining_information/hci2s08/"}
