It\u2019s by Angela Yu.   \n\nUdemy is a weird one where the courses are usually like \u201c$200\u201d but they run 80-90 percent off sales all the time.    I\u2019ve seen a lot of these online courses so this type of pricing \n\nShe\u2019s great.  Highly rated.  She also has a bunch of other lessons on their on a variety of topics and seems like the vast majority of people have positive things to say about her.\n\nEdit:  two other things.   It\u2019s called 100 days of coding, but don\u2019t get discouraged if one day actually takes you two days to complete.  Just put in a good honest effort and you\u2019ll get it eventually.  \n\n2nd thing, I actually really like her teaching style because she will explain the lesson, throw in words of encouragement, a small joke here and there to keep you engaged, etc.   it\u2019s not just a dry boring blah blah blah lecture.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phi1g3/i_stopped_wasting_my_time_playing_video_games_and/hbjyhh1/"}
