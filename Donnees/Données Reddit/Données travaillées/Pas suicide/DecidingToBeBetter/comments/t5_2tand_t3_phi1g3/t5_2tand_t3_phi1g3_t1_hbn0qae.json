Just meant that it\u2019s good to be learning coding and maybe if I stick with it, it could lead to a side hustle developing apps, or websites, or just making code and contributing to other people\u2019s projects, etc.  there\u2019s a ton of different ways to make either gig work with code or get hired somewhere with some coding knowledge.  \n\nLastly, just an interesting guy all around, look up \u201cmdickie\u201d.   He\u2019s a guy that started out coding simple 2D games in c++ and Visual Basic.   He gave away his first few games for free, then sold some on his website for like 15-20 bucks a piece or something, and just recently he actually released a 3D wrestling game that came out on the switch.  He\u2019s probably the best example of a single person with a passion making it in the gaming industry.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phi1g3/i_stopped_wasting_my_time_playing_video_games_and/hbn0qae/"}
