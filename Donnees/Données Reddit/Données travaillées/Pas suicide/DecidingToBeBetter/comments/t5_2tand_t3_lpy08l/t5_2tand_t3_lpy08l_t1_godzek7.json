I wrote a few pages a year ago and left it at that until a few weeks ago. What worked for me is realising that I will be relieved once its over and that I need to think about that long term gratification. I set a deadline for myself, it was before spending a special weekend with my boyfriend and slowly got to work. I figured out its the easiest for me to work in the morning so I can have the afternoon to recharge my batteries. I worked for an hour at a time, I set a timer for one hour and planned a little break to get coffee or a snack, it made it easier for me to push through. It might sound cliche but eating healthier and working out really made a difference in my energy levels and my ability to focus.\n\nThe hardest thing to do was to get over that little voice in my head that told me I cant do it, that its too hard, that maybe im not worth getting the diploma and that I should give up. Just sitting down to write literally made me feel sick for so long. If you have that voice too, its lying to you. You can do it and you are good enough. Just listen to your body and your mind and find a routine that fits you and remember that its going to be worth the hard work", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpy08l/submitted_my_thesis_despite_my_depression/godzek7/"}
