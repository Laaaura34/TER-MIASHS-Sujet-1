That sound awesome. I know it from experience it can be difficult to get things done when feeling depressed, it hit me in September after lockdown, though I do feel a little better right now, but I haven\u2019t been doing very good at work. Because work doesn\u2019t excite anymore, I don\u2019t feel motivated for almost anything. I have been wanting to do a job switch but not working on it. \nI really really appreciate what you did for yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpy08l/submitted_my_thesis_despite_my_depression/godzviq/"}
