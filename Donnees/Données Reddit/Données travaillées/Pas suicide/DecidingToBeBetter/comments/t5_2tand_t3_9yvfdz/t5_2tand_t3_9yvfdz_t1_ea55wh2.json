Maybe you dread it because your family is boring as shit and you already can\u2019t wait for it to be over so you can hang out with your friends.  Ok, but you\u2019re stuck there for the day at least.  How are you going to play it?  What could you say to try to spark a more interesting conversation than you\u2019d usually get?  Maybe there\u2019s a game or puzzle or conversation piece you could bring that might make the day better.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t have to be the most interesting thing ever.  Making even minimally interesting contributions is more rewarding than passively witnessing the most fascinating spectacle.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9yvfdz/needadvice_i_want_to_stop_chasing_novelty_and/ea55wh2/"}
