I like that you consider if a woman would feel comfortable/have the ability to say no/walk away w/out issue. I'm 29/f and I would say hearing that you considered asking if she had an engagement ring was not good. If you want to ask a woman out, do that. Do not first ask if she has a bf/husband/is engaged b/c that makes women uncomfortable. Like if a guy asked me if I had a bf and I said no, then he asked me out after, it makes the guy seem insecure and like he values a man's relationship to me over my agency to be single and say no without having to give a reason. I think there is some great advice all over but I would caution you to be sensitive to a lot of misogynistic roots that many pickup artists have. You seem sweet and considerate I wish you all good things \ud83d\udc95 Next time you connect w/a woman and have a nice conversation, you could say hi I've really enjoyed this conversation and I love how smiley your eyes are (ex. insert genuine compliment about them/something that came up in the conversation) then say would you like to get to know each other more? May I invite you out to dinner? Do not ask a woman out for drinks/a walk or something that may seem \"low pressure\" but is actually just low effort. Be ready to romance and seeing that you have an artist heart that  will hopefully be fun for you :) I hope 2021 is less lonely for you too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kaa0wo/i_talked_to_a_woman_and_she_responded_positively/gf962ji/"}
