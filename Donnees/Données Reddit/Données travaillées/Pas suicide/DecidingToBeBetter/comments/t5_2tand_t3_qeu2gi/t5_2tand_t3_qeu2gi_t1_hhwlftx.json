What would you say to a child who was upset? Who was angry? Who was depressed? You (hopefully) would be gentle and validating. You would tell them their emotions are okay to feel. Treating yourself with the same compassion you would treat a kid who is still learning and growing is the first step to a lifetime of self love. You are still learning and growing too. 17 is a really hard age. I promise you things will get better. You're really strong for facing up to your problems- acknowledging them at all is better than doing nothing. And I think you should congratulate yourself for that strength!\n\nAlso, therapy can be a really helpful resource for anyone of any age, regardless of whether or not you struggle with any mental issues or disorders. They could help you work on self love and regulating the things that you feel. Best of luck to you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qeu2gi/please_give_me_some_tips_to_be_a_better_person/hhwlftx/"}
