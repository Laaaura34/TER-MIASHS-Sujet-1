I also focused on doing things I found interesting and enjoyable, cos it's easier to keep those up.\n\nI've been writing down the good things for decades and still enjoy it.\n\nFor me it was a matter of achieving critical mass - doing enough things differently that my positive experiences and emotions outweighed the negative ones.\n\nWhen I had a relapse I'd try more new techniques and add them to my routine. I also have my \"power tools\" I bust out just on these occasions. I don't love doing them but they help me out if the hole. Two are meditation and cognitive work.\n\nBy the way I think your \"unhealthy\" things are fine. If you enjoy gaming then that's a mood booster, as long as it's time limited. Funny or uplifting videos are a mood booster. Working on something absorbing is a real mood booster.\n\nTwo books that have a lot of good info on how to achieve happiness and good ideas for techniques to try are Positivity by Barbara Fredrickson and The How of Happiness by Sonja Lyubomirsky. Good luck. It gets easier as you go on and the crashes get fewer and less painful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oydoiv/what_helped_you_with_depression_and_anxiety_in/h7sba1p/"}
