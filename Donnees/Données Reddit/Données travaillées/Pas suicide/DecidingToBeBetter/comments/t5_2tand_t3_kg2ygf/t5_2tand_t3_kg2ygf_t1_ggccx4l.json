Right now, please begin to love and nurture your body. Feed it good healthy fresh food. Take your body out for long walks in a park. This time in about giving yourself all the love, care, attention, acceptance, validation, and appreciation that you have so far been craving from the world. Stop it. Cut out every toxic person from your life for some time. YOU give YOURSELF the love, care, acceptance, validation, and appreciation that you seek. \n\nStart from there. Forgive yourself for everything. Resolve to start tomorrow as a new day. Live with this question: What is the next most empowering thing to do? And your own inner being will prompt you what that is. Sometimes it could be to take a shower. Sometimes it could be something as simple as eat an apple or something bigger lit sit with your self and breathe.
