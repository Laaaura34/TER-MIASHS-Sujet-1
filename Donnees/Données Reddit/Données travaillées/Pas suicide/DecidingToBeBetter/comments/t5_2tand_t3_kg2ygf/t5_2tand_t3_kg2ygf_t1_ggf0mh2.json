So what?  Everyone else is a fool, too, so we're all equal, but simply have different issues\".\n\nAsk yourself what aspects of yourself you want to get rid of and make a game plan for getting rid of them. Those tiny steps lead to small steps which lead to bigger steps...\n\nYOU DON'T WANT TO DIE, but you do have things you want to escape.  make lists.. after a few months, add to the list.  Your mind will slowly become more clear.  If your BF is an asshole, leave him when you can.  You may need him for a short while and that is okay. \n\nClean your surrounding.  Clearing away dirt and clutter is part of the process of clearing away the crap in your mind.  Take a B-complex supplement and get sunlight in your eyes and on your skin.  Get exercise. \n\nForgive yourself and then let those issues go. You are not who you were yesterday.
