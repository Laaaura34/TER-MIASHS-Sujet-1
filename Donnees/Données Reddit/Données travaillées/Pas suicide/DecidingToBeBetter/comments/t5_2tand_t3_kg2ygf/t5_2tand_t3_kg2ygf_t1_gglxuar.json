So a good way to look at it,is consider you already died. This is the start of your second life, try things you did not do before,do things your old you would not have done,take risks,talk to strangers,pet dogs in the street,climb to some roof,watch the sunset,look at the stars,exercise,enjoy some coffee,go all out.
