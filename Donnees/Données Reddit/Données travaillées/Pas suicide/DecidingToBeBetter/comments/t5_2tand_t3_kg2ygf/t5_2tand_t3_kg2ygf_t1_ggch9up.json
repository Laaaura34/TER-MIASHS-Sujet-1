I\u2019m sure it must be hard. But the fact that you posted tells me that there\u2019s a part of you that still has hope inside you and wants to get better and that\u2019s something worth celebrating because that takes a lot of strength. I know I\u2019m just some random stranger on the internet and I know it\u2019s probably not my place, but it also is because I want you to stick around. and I think maybe there\u2019s a part of you that wants to stick around too. And so you have to fight for that part of you because you are worth fighting for. If you can\u2019t tell yourself that right now that\u2019s ok. I\u2019m telling you that. Let me tell you that. You. Are. Worth. Fighting. For. Whatever you\u2019re experiencing right now, as fucking shitty as it is, is temporary. And you don\u2019t want to leave too soon. You deserve more than that.   Even if it doesn\u2019t seem like you can think about a big future right now that\u2019s ok. Just think about tomorrow. And how no matter what, the sun will come up. And you can try again. And you can pick or make something small to look forward to. And that can be all. That\u2019s enough. You are enough.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggch9up/"}
