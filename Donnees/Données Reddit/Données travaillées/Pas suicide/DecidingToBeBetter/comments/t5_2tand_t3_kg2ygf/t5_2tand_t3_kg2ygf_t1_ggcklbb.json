I also remember the embarrassment. Had many people i was friends with and the person i was dating at the time make me feel like i was supposed to feel embarrassed. Here\u2019s my advice: let any authority figures know what happened. you dont have to tell them everything , most people back off once you bring up mental health. whatever you\u2019re comfortable with, let then know. rest, drink water, eat fruits, vegetables, some type of protein to refuel yourself. many others have commented resources: take advantage of those. don\u2019t talk to anyone unless you need to (work or school obligations) or want to (non-toxic fam/friends reaching out). there\u2019s about 20 little worksheets i got from the hospital that summarizes various mental health advice from bad ways of thinking and how to fix them, to examples of affirmations to repeat. remember to take long, deep breaths if you feel anxious, and ground yourself by essentially just playing ISpy by yourself if you start to feel disconnected. \nI can\u2019t offer more besides dms of the papers if you\u2019re interested, but i hope you feel better even if not. stay safe.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggcklbb/"}
