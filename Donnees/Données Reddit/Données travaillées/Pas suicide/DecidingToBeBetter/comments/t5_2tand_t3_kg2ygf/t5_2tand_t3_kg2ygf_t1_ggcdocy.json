However:\n\n1) I have friends that have attempted suicide at various points. EVERY Single One of Them is now in a much better place. They haven't all \"made it\", some are still finding their feet a few years later, but they are all better than they were. Life takes time, shit is hard, and things will suck. The important thing is that you have the rest of your life to work it out. Suicide is a very permanent solution to very temporary problems.\n\n2) You need to find what help you can. Humans are aggressively social, and we aren't designed to deal with our problems on our own. The caveman who went \"I'll sort this out by myself, don't want to be a burden\" got eaten by tigers. You have been crafted by evolution to seek out help, and others have been crafted to give it (and visa versa). Talk to your loved ones and friends, get whatever counselling/therapy you can afford, talk to a doctor about what medications might help. Your brain is meat with electricity going through it and sometimes it will go wrong. I take medicine for my lungs and heart, the body sucks and the brain is no different, there's no shame in it.\n\n3) [This video](https://youtu.be/eQNw2FBdpyE) may help, it's from someone who can speak more directly to your experience (though maybe watch it when you're ready. It touches on the creator's suicide attempt)\n\nYou got this", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggcdocy/"}
