Just imagine what all those people on social media's insecurities are. The more often they post the more insecure they actually are.\n\n And know for a fact that you're not the only one struggling with whatever you're struggling with. Even if it seems super unique and awful right now, you're still not the only one. Search for stories of people who got through this and look to them for a little inspiration. \n\nAnd forgive yourself for not being perfect. There is more to life than being the \"best\". Forgive yourself for all of it. You were only trying to be something unattainable that wasn't worth being anyway. \n\nIf we lived three thousand years ago, and we were having this conversation around a campfire, and you went to sleep with the fire crackling beside you, how would you feel in the morning? Nearly a hundred people encouraged you! I *think* you would feel like you belong in this world, like you deserve the good things life has to offer, you deserve a rest, a bit of forgiveness, and some real people around you. I hope you can believe that things can change and you can make good with what you've been given.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggci6aj/"}
