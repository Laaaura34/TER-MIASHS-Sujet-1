First up, it may help you to delete your social media apps, not necessarily deleting your accounts. In the past year I have slowly removed myself from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and it has worked wonders on my mental health, maybe you could give this a go? I recommend doing it gradually rather than suddenly as you'll have more chance of success. \n\nSecondly, I'm super glad you failed. We need you in this world. You're an important part of society and I can assure you that many people love you. Reach out to people and they will help.\n\nYou are not a loser. I'm sorry the health care system failed you. If you can afford it, I recommend seeking professional counseling. In the UK you can get free counseling on the NHS, this is also a great route, however the wait can be pretty long sometimes. \n\nGood luck. Message me if you need to. You have got this. Things will get better, I promise.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggcebol/"}
