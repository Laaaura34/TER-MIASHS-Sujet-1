It makes sense that seeing social media would influence you to feel that way about yourself. Like many others have pointed out, they may have their own struggles as well, and are perhaps not as vocal about their struggles. \n\nIt sounds like by you making the post here today, you are wanting to connect with others in some way shape or form, and I think this is crucial to remember from this point forward. In fact, I would argue that you making the post today is a sign that you are already taking the first step forward by asking for help. For starters, it might be worth having a conversation with a counsellor about the thoughts that you are experiencing, or anyone that you feel you could trust about your struggles. I like helping people, and even in the darkest of times I try to remember this and what brings me even the slightest hints of joy.\n\nStart small, with baby steps, one day at a time :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggcdgtp/"}
