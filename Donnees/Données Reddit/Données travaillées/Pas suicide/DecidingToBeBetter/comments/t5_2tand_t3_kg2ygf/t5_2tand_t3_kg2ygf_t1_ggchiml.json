I did that for so long and just logging off social media for a month I noticed how much it had an impact on my life. Social media only shows what people want you to see. They only show you that small snippet of their day that looks fun or is fun. You are here for a reason. Trust me. I was an alcoholic and severely depressed and although I\u2019ve been clean for two years not much has changed. Until today I got about seven different forms of good news and it\u2019s great and my life is finally turning around. It\u2019ll happen when you least expect it. Dust yourself off, get the help you need and although you can\u2019t see it, it gets better. Be thankful you failed today! Also, if someone makes you feel like committing suicide, walk away. You\u2019re the most important thing in your life. If someone doesn\u2019t benefit or make your life better, drop them. It may be hard but once you get some fresh air, you\u2019ll wonder why you didn\u2019t do it sooner.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggchiml/"}
