I HEAVILY suggest getting off social media; it helped me so much. I always get depressed seeing others so happy, with their families that I never had to have, etc. But like another said, people are only showing the best parts of their lives.\n\nI'd suggest looking into therapists yourself! Call your insurance, or if you don't have any, look up free services near you. To get a really good idea of good free services, actually I recommend calling therapists in the area; they're awesome resources. Mine told me of a free network she's in so I can get help for my boyfriend (who has many suicide attempts under his belt).\n\nWhy'd they suggest breaking up with your partner?\n\nIf you need anyone to talk to, my DMs are open \u2665\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggcigjx/"}
