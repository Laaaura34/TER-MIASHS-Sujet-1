I can\u2019t imagine how horrible it must feel. If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s helped me, it\u2019s the thought that the one thing that everyone has is their life and it is the most valuable and mystical thing that any one of us has! If I were in your shoes I\u2019d start with seeing a psychiatrist for more than a few minutes. Then a therapist. After that I\u2019d build my life up based on social obligation aka work then relaxation habits (like working out and masturbation both release hormones that should help) independent or with your partner. Also a regular sleep schedule would help a lot with the hormone imbalances and brain chemistry related things.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggcg1xf/"}
