One day at a time, just focus on that right now. \n\nIgnore social media, it's all lies. I'd recommend to get rid of it entirely, unless it connects you with people in an important way that benefits you. I had suicidal ideation a few years ago and got rid of my fb and it was helpful to do that at the time - I got less caught up in bullshit others wanted me to see. \n\nThat nurse was somewhat negligent. There are good people in the mental health profession, try to make it a priority to go seek them out. It's hard, but get that initial meeting with a therapist booked. I've had terrible experiences with doctors and MH professionals and it's put me off, but there are also many incredible professionals who will listen and care. Try not to let that bad experience with the nurse put you off seeking professional support. You deserve it mate, you don't deserve to feel like this. \n\nIf there's one thing you can do each day, even if you can't get out of bed, is get paper and pen and journal every day. This doesn't have to be in the form of words, it can be drawings, colouring, whatever works for you, could even just be scribbling all over the page.\n\nWishing you all the best, keep going one day at a time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggcj50m/"}
