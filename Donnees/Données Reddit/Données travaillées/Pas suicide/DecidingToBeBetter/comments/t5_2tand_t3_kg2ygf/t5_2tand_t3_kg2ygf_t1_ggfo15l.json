It helps to talk about it with a guided professional. I\u2019d also ask to find out if you have a local support group that meets on a regular basis you\u2019re gonna need some community around you while you\u2019re going through this difficult time. \n\nI\u2019d personally advise you to strongly consider deleting social media and freeing yourself from your phone. I limit my phone time to an hour a day and I\u2019ve been doing it for 3 months and I get more done as a result and I\u2019m actively engaged in what I\u2019m doing even if I\u2019m doing nothing I\u2019m actively engaged in it because there\u2019s a healthy boundary there. Everyone who takes these steps notices these same effects. \n\nTry not to compare you\u2019re reality to someone else\u2019s ideal that they publicly put out there. Because when you see someone standing with the latest Benz or whatever odds are they\u2019re up to their eyeballs in debt and struggling to sleep to keep up the mirage of a perfect life that just doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nI want you to know that you have nothing to be embarrassed about you\u2019re situation has happened and it\u2019s up to you to put in some work to improve your situation.  But you can do this and I\u2019ll be rooting for you in spirit and in prayer.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggfo15l/"}
