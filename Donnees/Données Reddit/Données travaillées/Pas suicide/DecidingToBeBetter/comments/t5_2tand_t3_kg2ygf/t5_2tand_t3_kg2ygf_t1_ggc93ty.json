She felt like a burden to us and was so unhappy but we loved her so much and she was definitely not a burden no matter how much she thought so. I hope you have some loved ones who do care about you but if not know that I do even if I am a random internet stranger. \n\nSocial media is really a poor standard to compare your life to others, people only show their best side (usually) but everyone is dealing with this whole situation not as well as they let on I'm sure. I know there is a specific subreddit you can talk to other people better equipped about this (I'll try and find and post it if I can) but at least try and find a therapist and at least talk to them for a couple sessions, it may help or at least point you in the right direction. \n\nI wish you the best and please feel free to reach out to me anytime and I'll try and get back to you soon as I can.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggc93ty/"}
