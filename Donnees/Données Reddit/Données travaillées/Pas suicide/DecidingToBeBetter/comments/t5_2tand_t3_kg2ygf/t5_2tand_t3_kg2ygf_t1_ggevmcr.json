Unless they have rich parents which is like 1% , most of them fake everything for likes. They get clothes from expensive stores, take pictures with it and return it. Work as escorts or scam people. Not all of them of course, but trust me, its all fake. I seen some people posting happy couple pictures with \"love you forever\" titles and break up week later because one of them cheated for months. People do crazy shit to get these \"likes\" Trust me, you don't want that kind of life. Making other people happy, falling in love with ourselves and finding your passion is what makes us happy. Life is not a race, what you should do now is give yourself some time to heal. Rememeber, We, humans, we can always do better, we can always improve, there is no limits. We all have ability to learn something new and be better than we were yesterday. Its going to be okay, just don't give up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggevmcr/"}
