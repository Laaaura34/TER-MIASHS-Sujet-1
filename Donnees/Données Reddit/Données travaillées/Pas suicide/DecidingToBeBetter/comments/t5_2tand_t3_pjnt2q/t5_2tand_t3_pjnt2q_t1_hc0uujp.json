Trust me, I get that more than most people would. \nFocus on the small, joyful, peaceful, enchanting moments and things that you see. The reflection of light on a puddle, the tiniest moments of kindness between people that you happen to see- you have to make your moments, and especially make your moments of peace, which sounds like something you crave.\nTake a breath when you go to drink water, and make that moment one of your small moments of calm contentment.\nDay to day, moment to moment you may not feel any difference at all, but at the end of the day you can sit down and breathe, and create another small beautiful moment, and think of all of the moments and things you consciously chose to pay attention to and remember that day- and that really does add up. Your days sort of gain a softer glow on them, and on the worst days, you have your small moments of peace that you yourself create and can depend on.\n\nDoing this, along with trying to find just 3 things a day to be grateful for, has helped me get through the last 3 years where almost every day I did not want to wake up, but I dragged myself through and am finally able to see a light again, and I did it literally moment by moment, just trying to fill myself with any shred of good feelings I could gather (smell is an amazing tool to take you to a better moment/ head space).\nI apologize this was all over the place, I hope it made sense and can help in some way.
