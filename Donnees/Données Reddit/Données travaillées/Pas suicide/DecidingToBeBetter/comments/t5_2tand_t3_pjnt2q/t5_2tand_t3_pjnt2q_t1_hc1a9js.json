There are lots of insights to be found in those traditions and you don't need to become a Xist, just learn from them.\n\nYou might want to try journaling or gratitude journaling (once every few days). There's science to back up gratitude journaling if you google around for it.\n\nLastly I'll add meditation. Lots of good resources out there. I like the app Insight Timer. Lots of free guided meditations there.\n\nIf you can move back to SD that works too! Investigating this stuff will help you even if you move back. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjnt2q/how_to_change_your_reaction_to_situations_when/hc1a9js/"}
