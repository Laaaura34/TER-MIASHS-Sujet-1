I've been so stressed with my niece and the end of school year homework(for first grade online), and dealing with my mental illness, and my sister(who lost custody to mom). \n\nToday, my niece is quietly doing her homework in her room while she watches some mario lets plays on youtube. She doesn't want to do anything else, and it's been such a godsend. And I'm only dealing with one kid!!!\n\nI'm glad you've found a balance with all three kids, and that you have grown a lot over the past while.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o2ri99/realizing_im_a_shit_parent_progress_update/h28s0m2/"}
