As a fellow parent and a therapist who helps parents be better parents ... I'm so proud of you for recognizing what you weren't doing well and then making the changes needed to make things better.  Just that action shows your kids that it's okay to make mistakes.  Something I have found helpful is giving myself a time out too when I'm \"having a lot of feelings\" and sometimes I take a time out with my kiddo so we can both reset; that has helped us stay connected.  I wish you and your babies continued success in your journey.  Keep fighting the good fight \u2661  You've got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o2ri99/realizing_im_a_shit_parent_progress_update/h27xnkj/"}
