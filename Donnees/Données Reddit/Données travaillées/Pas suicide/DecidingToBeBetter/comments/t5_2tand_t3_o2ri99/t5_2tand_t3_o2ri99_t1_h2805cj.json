I do actually do the \"time out\" thing by having the kids take a short \"quiet time\" during the day. It helps me survive the evenings. I experience sensory overload really easily, so having that time where they're playing quietly in their rooms is helpful. I've tried powering through it, but I end up just causing more damage to myself and everyone around me. I set it for when the baby is napping (1.5 - 2 hours) and use about a half hour of that time to have special individual time with one of the older kids, since the baby still takes up a lot of my attention.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o2ri99/realizing_im_a_shit_parent_progress_update/h2805cj/"}
