A year ago, I got tired of my mom's toxic bullshit and called her out on the neglect and abuse I faced not only as a child, but as an adult. I told her not to contact me or expect to see her grandkids until she cleaned up her act. Of course, there was a lot of \"your childhood wasn't THAT bad\" and \"I did this this and that for you\" and my favorite \"I basically raised your kids while you went out partying.\" (Before I met my husband, I was a single mom desperate to get out of said mother's house. I worked *a lot,* yes, went on dates sometimes, but never partied.)\n\nAfter I stopped replying, I guess she contacted my sister and asked her about her/our childhood, if it was really that bad. My sister informed her that she couldn't say because she didn't remember most of it. I guess that was finally the breaking point for her, because she started going to the doctor, seeing a therapist, and is (mostly) taking care of herself. Our relationship is slowly getting better and I'm starting to trust her. \n\nI hope that gives you some hope. I don't know your mother to speak about her, but people surprise you sometimes. I confronted my mom and she started turning herself around. Maybe your mom can/will, too. \n\n\u2764\ufe0fGood luck\u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o2ri99/realizing_im_a_shit_parent_progress_update/h2894gr/"}
