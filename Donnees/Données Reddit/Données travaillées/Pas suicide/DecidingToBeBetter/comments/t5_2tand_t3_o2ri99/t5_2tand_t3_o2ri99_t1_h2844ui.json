I do time-outs and deep breathing with the kids, too. My son started showing early signs of potential anger issues, and that was one of my early warning signs to myself. When he would get angry, we'd step away and do deep breathing and talk about what we're feeling, why, and what we should do next time. I had a lot of anger issues growing up, and I didn't want that for my son. Especially my son (not that my daughters aren't equally important, of course, but I'd hate for him to turn that anger into domestic abuse). It really helped a lot and his behavior really turned around at that point. \n\nI wish that was the point I realized I needed more changes in my life, but unfortunately, it still took my poor 5 year old begging me for attention in the way 5 year olds do for me to realize how big my problem is.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o2ri99/realizing_im_a_shit_parent_progress_update/h2844ui/"}
