It's more about where your boyfriend is in HIS life right now. For example, I have a few ex's who I'd be great with, but we were terrible in our youth. The reason- I wasn't in the right place. I didn't know who I was, what I wanted. So, your boyfriend today is not the same boyfriend he was to those other chicks a few years back.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os2hf1/how_do_i_stop_overthinking/h6nakyp/"}
