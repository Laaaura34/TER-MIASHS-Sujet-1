What in particular is making you feel inadequate?  Only once we reveal things can we deal with them.  So once you find what you think you are inadequate at,  ask your SO what they think about it, is it an issue? Do you need to sort this inadequacy or is it all in your head? Be methodical in your approach and act as if you are looking at your relationship from outside.  What triggers you to feel like this? Is it an event?  Have you talked to your partner in a manor where you can constructively build upon this issue and remove it?\n\nHope some of these questions help.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os2hf1/how_do_i_stop_overthinking/h6msn4h/"}
