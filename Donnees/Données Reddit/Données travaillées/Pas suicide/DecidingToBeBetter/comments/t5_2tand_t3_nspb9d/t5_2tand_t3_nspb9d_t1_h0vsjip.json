Thank you for telling me your story. I'm glad you were able to figure it out. I really dont understand why we are so hard on ourselves to the point that we ignore our needs and feel bad for giving ourselves more time. Tbh, my exams ended a week ago and I had barely slept. This entire week I spent sleeping and feeling bad about getting that much needed rest at the back of my mind. We do need to take care of ourselves...like...a lot. I understand that now. Most of my bad habits range from not doing anything at all and pushing myself over the edge to achieve something. There needs to be a balance for sure. Ugh we have been turned into barely functioning robots at this point tbh.\n\nAfter years of bottling stuff up, I finally started real self improvement a 3-4 months ago and that literally started with me yelling and ranting on reddit. And have somehow been able to get over  my anxieties. It does take a LOT OF TIME which we need to give to do all this stuff and not really feel guilty about doing that.\n\nI'm so very glad you were able to do all of that and are helping people as well. Bless you. Thanks a lot <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nspb9d/sleep_schedule_crisisagain/h0vsjip/"}
