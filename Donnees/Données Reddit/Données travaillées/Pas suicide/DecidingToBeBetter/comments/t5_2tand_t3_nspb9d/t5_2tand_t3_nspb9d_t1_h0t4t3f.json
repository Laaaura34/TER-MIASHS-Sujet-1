If they are red or dull or tired it means I did not sleep well. It doesn't matter if I was supposedly sleeping for 15 hours. If you don't get to deep sleep then you will never be rested. However, if you are hitting deep sleep and are being tested then the next thing is to start working on your mindset...put an alarm clock and actually wake up at that time every day..once it becomes a habit then add another one like \"I am going to do this....\" and another one. Force yourself to do certain things every day....Force yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nspb9d/sleep_schedule_crisisagain/h0t4t3f/"}
