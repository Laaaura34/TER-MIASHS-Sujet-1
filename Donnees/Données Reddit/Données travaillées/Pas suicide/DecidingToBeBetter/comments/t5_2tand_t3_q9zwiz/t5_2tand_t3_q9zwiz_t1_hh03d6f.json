If you have friends in your area, it might be nice to maintain those connections. Also, I\u2019ve heard familial relationships can improve a lot after kids move out. You\u2019re a young adult, and it\u2019s normal to want to have some distance from your family. If you still want to come back and visit, staying local can help with that. \n\nIt also gives you the \u201ctaste\u201d of moving out without risking all your life savings to move across the country. Think of it as an experiment: how many of your needs (for independence, for self-fulfillment; these are all legitimate needs) can be met by simply moving into your own apartment? If you still find yourself wanting more after a few months, consider moving across the country. \n\nSome of this is me talking to myself. I\u2019m the same age as you, and tired of living with my family, I moved across the country trying to declare my independence. Now I\u2019m feeling lonely, I miss my friends and family. I\u2019m now thinking of moving back to a city near my home, but not moving back in with my parents. I want to have the distance, but have it be at an arm\u2019s length and not at a country\u2019s length.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9zwiz/should_i_24f_leave_my_parents_home_and_move/hh03d6f/"}
