That way your expenses will be less than if you move by yourself. Give yourself a timeframe and if you have not found anything while you are being hosted then just go back and think of it as a breather from the other environment.\n\nYour family sounds complicated but you shouldn\u2019t close the door on them and go far away where you know no one but your boyfriend. As other commenters have said you could be putting yourself in a sticky situation if LDR bf turns out not to be who you thought he was or if you break up. Especially because the depression, anxiety and self-esteem issues are risk factors when it comes to being a victim of abusive relationships.\n\nTry to find a middle ground plan where you don\u2019t have to blow ALL your savings, try not to burn the bridge with your family (you never know when you might need them) but you definitely need to find a way to cope with the toxic situation there or step aside but never at the cost of EVERYTHING you have because you will put yourself in between a rock and a hard place.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9zwiz/should_i_24f_leave_my_parents_home_and_move/hgzrdjo/"}
