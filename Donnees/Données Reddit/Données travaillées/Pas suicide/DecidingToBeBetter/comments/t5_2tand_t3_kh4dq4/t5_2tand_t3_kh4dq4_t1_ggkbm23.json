I had a similar experience, came to the states from Asia, mom worked all the time, raised by grandmother. I didn't feel loved and was a people pleaser, until I got a dog (on a whim) after college and he had taught me a lot and I grew on to my own. He taught me about volunteering (we  were a therapy dog team) Since then, I have moved on to pursue a career I'm passionate about, have more pets, became financially independent,  learn instruments, and change who I am. BTW, I have little connection with my mom btw because I limit all that will impede my growth. \n\nHave you consider getting a pet, plants, or personal hobby? Giving and connecting with others (regardless of whether they will return the favor) is great practice, imo, is a great way to potentially find your purpose.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kh4dq4/ive_wasted_the_last_10_years_of_my_life_chasing/ggkbm23/"}
