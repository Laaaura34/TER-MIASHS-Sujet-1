Started healing around 27. I would say a few things- change is slow and comes in baby steps. One thing that sped up the process for me by 1000x was meditation. I only discovered it recently but I am 100% sure this would help you a lot. It gives you a new vantage point, a peaceful one where you can retreat from your thoughts and fears that cause them and look at your life objectively (objectively is not the right word but what I mean is not cynically and without fear). \n\nThe skill of knowing what people need and knowing how to give it to them and make them feel good will certainly help you in your career in the future as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kh4dq4/ive_wasted_the_last_10_years_of_my_life_chasing/ggkcxkh/"}
