When you get a revelation of his love for you everything will start to make sense.  When you give him your brokenness he will put you back together.  He will mend your relationships in your family and make you whole.\nI pray you will see that Christianity is not a religion but is the summation of all humanity birthed by God and for God. He wants to give you wholeness and peace.  We are eternal beings and when we discover his love we want life more and more. \nAll things work for good for those called according to his purpose.\nThe end of the world is near.  Give him a try.
