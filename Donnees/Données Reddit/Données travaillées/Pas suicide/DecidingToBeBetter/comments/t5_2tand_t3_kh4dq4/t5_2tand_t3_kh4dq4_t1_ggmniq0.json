For me I was 28 when I had that realization - but it was different because I\u2019m a musician...so over 10 years my only hobby became my work, and then suddenly I woke up realizing I was defined only by my job and by what others wanted me to be.. (people pleasers often find ourselves becoming performers for that reason).\n\nIt\u2019s two years later and I have tons of hobbies I love like legos and drawing, I\u2019m into bullet journals and baking and I run and also keep fruit trees! (Lol)\n\nThe BIG thing I did was download lists and lists of \u201cget to know yourself\u201d questionnaires from psychology and spiritual well-being websites (tiny Buddha is a good one), and I took the time to answer each question thoroughly in my journal over the course of months.
