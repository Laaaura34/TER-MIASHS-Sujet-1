I think I took life too seriously and was too hard on myself so I stuck to shitty mediocre relationships too long because I loathe failure and when I finally threw in the towel it destroyed me because I didn\u2019t know how to take failure and rejection with grace. We can\u2019t win all the time. I missed out on a lot of life experiences and I wouldn\u2019t say I am necessarily jealous of others but I wish I had them earlier because I just ended up having them later when everyone else already had their social shit figured out. \n\nAlso my interests are esoteric af - I didn\u2019t intend for it to be this way but without topical superficial interests I get really into shit no one else cares about and I have little to no one to share them with. In turn it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy that my weird narrow interests prevents me from befriending snd relating with more people so I feel very isolated often. \n\nTo my advantage I\u2019m a lot more responsible and self sufficient than many of my peers, but I\u2019m not happier or more fulfilled. \n\nAt the end of the day what I recommend is resilience and balance between having fun and being a hard worker.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kh4dq4/ive_wasted_the_last_10_years_of_my_life_chasing/ggk3xrs/"}
