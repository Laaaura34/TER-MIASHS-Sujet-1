I wished I had understood this earlier. \n\nI also have no hobbies because during my childhood I was never introduced to any and afterwards I was too busy making myself available for other people's plans. I'm still trying to figure out how am I going to find out what I really like. My whole life I would feel influenced and almost forced to like what the people I thought were cool would like. It's embarrassing and a bit scary to be honest.\n\nGood luck to us! Hope you get better from covid soon and are able to put the plans for your new life in practice! \n\nAll the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kh4dq4/ive_wasted_the_last_10_years_of_my_life_chasing/ggjdl9n/"}
