I was absolutely certain that things wouldn't get better but I had nothing to lose by trying, so I did. 5 years later SO much has changed, the severe social anxiety and depression I had that caused me to want to die in the first place greatly subsided when I was finally put on the right medication. There are things I'm doing now that I didn't think possible 5 years ago. I have a purpose, and dreams, and I am very close to achieving a goal I made for myself all those years ago. I say all of that to say this, I know what you're going through/what you've been through and I know its not easy at all so I just want to give you all the props. People like me and you exist! And to those who have been told \"it gets better\" I just want to say I know it's patronising and annoying but it's true if you keep going. So much will change as long as your actions reflect the changes you want to see.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m3gj7m/i_told_myself_that_if_my_life_didnt_improve_by/gqp3yrv/"}
