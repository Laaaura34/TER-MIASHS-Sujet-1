I am going to bring up couples therapy. Something needs to change somewhere. I want to be able to feel independent. I haven\u2019t been able to work much as the stay at home parent... and he has never wanted me working weekends or evenings, shifts opposite of what he\u2019s been working. I can\u2019t have a credit card of my own to build credit in my name...and I mean one to benefit the house (like when we need an appliance or something). My name has not been on either of our two mortgages in the last seventeen years. I feel really stuck and like I\u2019m not in any kind of a partnership. It needs to change.... but I know I need a third party/outside help to make me confident that it is not just me like he always says.\n\nI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m even going with this... I guess I can just see myself being in your same position if something doesn\u2019t give soon.\n\nYou\u2019re doing great, though!! I hope you are so proud of yourself. I am proud of you.
