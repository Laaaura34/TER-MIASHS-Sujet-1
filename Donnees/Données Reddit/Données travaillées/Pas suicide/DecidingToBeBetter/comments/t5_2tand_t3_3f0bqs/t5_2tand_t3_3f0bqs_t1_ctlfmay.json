They *want* to work a lot and succeed at everything they do. If it was just about the money, they would just quit once they made x million (see Zuckerberg, Musk, Jobs, Gates etc.). On the other hand, I don't know anyone who works 9 to 5 and has made millions or built a successful business.\n\nThe examples you gave often didn't do it for money either, they were driven by a purpose (Franklin, Thatcher, Napoleon). I'm sure they didn't go to bed early.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3f0bqs/getting_up_at_5am_11_reasons_why_you_have_to_do/ctlfmay/"}
