I'm up at 5:45. However, I can only do that when I get to bed by 10 or 10:30. \n\nWhat did change for me is that I made the mistake of not working when I stayed up late. I would stay up to 1 or so, then get up at 9 or 10, and overall I just wasn't as productive because when it got dark outside, that triggered something in me that it was time to relax. So...perhaps sunshine has a lot to do with it. \n\nNow...when I work indoors and have lots of light over my head, I can be very productive till the wee hours in the morning. \n\nSo I think it's a matter of where you put yourself and how you program your day. Rising early seems to fix a lot of that, and/or just makes it easy. \n\nI guess what I'm saying, is that perhaps daylight and darkness has a lot to do with productivity...so inherently early risers will experience more daytime light to be more productive. \n\nI do wonder what sort of an effect VR will have on us. Would love to wear some goggles where I see sunshine while I can do my work...even if it's all dark out. \n\nHate winters. \n\nThanks!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3f0bqs/getting_up_at_5am_11_reasons_why_you_have_to_do/ctlqmx6/"}
