This is the first step to detachment  of \u201cauto-pilot\u201d and starting the journey of self-discovery. Often, people can not take ownership of their side of the road because they are immersed in auto-pilot. They simply cannot see it. It\u2019s better described as \u201clife is happening to me, versus life is happening for me.\u201d From what you\u2019ve written, you seem to be stepping onto the life is happening for me road, and this is important, and should be celebrated. \n\nYou realize you made a major decision based on a scarcity mindset, and are accepting it as so, and now improving upon what you can control\u2014reaction. And also examining how this applies to personal relationships as well. Keep asking yourself hard questions, lean into the discomfort, and it\u2019s there you can decide what honors you, and what doesn\u2019t. Questions like, \u201chow is fear ruling my life?\u201d \u201cWhy do I believe I won\u2019t find love, or a significant other?\u201d Be honest and gentle with yourself, and start unwinding those negative gremlins in your head that create a low-lying ceiling. You can do this, and you are worth it! I wish you much success in the year ahead, and hope you continue on this path of self-discovery!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p3kcip/deciding_not_to_make_decisions_in_a_state_of_panic/h8xm5pp/"}
