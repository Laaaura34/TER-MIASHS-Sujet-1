I do a lot more thinking than doing. I\u2019ve taken some small steps towards improving this too, and just sharing more in the spirit of \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together\u201d. \n\nI think everyone compares themselves to others and feel inadequate. It\u2019s some weird widespread thing where we all feel inadequate, isolated and alone, and that we\u2019re not quite doing what we\u2019re meant to be. We rarely realize that we. all. feel. like. this. We\u2019re all so much more alike than we remotely realize.. anyway, I\u2019ve been trying to do more of the things I tell myself I like doing, but never actually do. Like reading, writing and drawing. My daily mantra has been \u201cdo more of the things you love\u201d and coupled with an intense focus on staying Present, and finding things to be grateful for, there\u2019s more and more, the closer you look.. it\u2019s been going well. I recommend trying it. Also love yourself. There is nothing wrong with you, we\u2019re just all growing and learning, it literally is what it is, all paths lead to The Path, we get there when we get there, enjoy the journey, build your own heaven on Earth. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jwv3x6/implementing_small_changes_for_my_weak_mindset/gcsmxu9/"}
