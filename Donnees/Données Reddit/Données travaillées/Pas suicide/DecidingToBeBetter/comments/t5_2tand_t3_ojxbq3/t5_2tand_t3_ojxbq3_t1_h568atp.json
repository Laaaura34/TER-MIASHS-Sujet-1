I\u2019m glad you are able to recognize when it\u2019s best to let it go. I really hope there\u2019s a chance for us to try again but sometimes I fear that she doesn\u2019t want to tell me she might\u2019ve already decided that she will never take me back. She\u2019s been pretty clear that there may be a chance down the line when we\u2019re both in a better place but I can\u2019t help but worry. She answered all my dreams when she came into my life but I stagnated and stopped growing or working on me and that lead to a lot of issues between us. I can only hope that she can see how much I changed when the time is right.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojxbq3/today_i_trusted_my_gut_and_chose_not_to_rekindle/h568atp/"}
