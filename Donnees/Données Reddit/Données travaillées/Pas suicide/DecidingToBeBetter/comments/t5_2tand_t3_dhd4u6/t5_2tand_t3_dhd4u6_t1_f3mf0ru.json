Thank you for the reminder! \n\nI love your meditations and attitude towards life! I'm intrigued by celery juice, how does it taste? Do you feel more alert/refreshed after drinking it? :) I've been trying Kale/spinach smoothies and they really make me feel healthy! \n\nI've also been doing the same thing lately! I used to wake up at 11am (or later!) every single day. It was also hard to get out of bed and face the day for me, but I've been using the \"Bedtime\" function on my (apple!) phone and been setting my bedtime from 12 AM-6AM, and it's really helped! I get a reminder to wind down for bed at 11pm, and I usually start to get mentally/emotionally ready for bed time. I've been able to consistently get up at 8:30am naturally. \n\nUnfortunately, because of life stresses and anxiety lately, I've been getting really bad panic attacks in the mornings, and I struggle to go to sleep (so I don't have to face another day) or get out of the comforting mess of blankets in the morning! I've been really battling my inner fears that automatically assault me every morning, so I think meditating in the morning can help\\~ I already do some grounding in order to overcome my panic attacks, so I think I will try this!  \n\nYou are absolutely right that we need to be compassionate with ourselves! I want to change my self-sabotaging attitude towards life! You inspire me OP!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dhd4u6/changing_your_morning_routine_can_change_your_life/f3mf0ru/"}
