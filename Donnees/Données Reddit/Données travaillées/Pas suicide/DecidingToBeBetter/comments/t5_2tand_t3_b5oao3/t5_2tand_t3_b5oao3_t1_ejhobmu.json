Probably possible, depending on how you're defining the high flying job, and how much time you want to spend with your loving family. For example, I've got a relative who is a high-power lawyer, who makes a lot of money as well as having a lovely family - the wife does most of the childrearing while he is busy working. I've got another family member who got a medical degree, and while her kids were little she worked part time so that she could spend time with her kids and as they got older and moved away from home, she would take time off work to go visit them - she's not making the type of money people expect a doctor to make (many of the doctors that she works with have nannies to look after the kids while they work long hours), but quality time with her family is more important to her.
