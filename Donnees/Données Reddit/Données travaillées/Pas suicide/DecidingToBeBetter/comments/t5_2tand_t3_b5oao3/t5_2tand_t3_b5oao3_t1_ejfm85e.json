The media, social media included, has a tendency towards bigger, flashier, more exotic or luxurious, etc, and many people in our society buy into that fame and fortune perspective. Goals and ambitions are well and good, but I think most people would rather have a stable job and a loving family than fame and fortune without a stable, loving family life. I think it is more likely that some of your peers are lying to themselves about what is most important to them, than you are lying to yourself about your aspirations. It doesn't read to me like you're lazy (marriages and fatherhood and a stable job all take work and effort), it reads to me like you understand yourself and your desires more than your average 20-year-old. You're doing well, my friend. Keep it up. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b5oao3/is_it_bad_if_i_just_want_to_live_a_simpleaverage/ejfm85e/"}
