We're in Northern California, and California environmental laws have some pretty stringent requirements.\n\nOur biologists go out in the field looking for special status species, endangered species, and arborist information,  wetlands information that sort of thing.\n\nWe have one employee who has her PhD and does all sorts of restoration work. There is a plethora of opportunity and what you're studying.\n\nSpend as much time as you can learning to write well. Get your English down, and get as much experience as you can. We are desperately looking for biologists to help with monitoring as well.\n\nIt sounds like you've got a pretty full life, and have your priorities in a good place. Keep up the good work, study hard, and you'll be okay.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nze97x/general_advice_for_20_yr_old/h1p7ohq/"}
