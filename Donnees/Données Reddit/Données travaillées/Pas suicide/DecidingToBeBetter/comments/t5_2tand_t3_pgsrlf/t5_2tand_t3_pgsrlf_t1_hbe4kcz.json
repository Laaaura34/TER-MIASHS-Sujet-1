I love hearing experiences from other people who are walking down the same path. It encourages me to keep going. \n\nI love what you said about taking punches. I'm a spunky lady and that resonates with me. I've always tried to block and dodge, but I think Shaolin tiger style might be more my jam. Take a punch and give 3 back! \n\nAt the very least I respect myself more and that in itself is worth more than that stupid corporate job could ever offer.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgsrlf/i_didnt_like_my_life_so_i_quit_my_job_and_became/hbe4kcz/"}
