The Universe has been my greatest teacher and Guru, but it took a good 40 something years before I learned how to listen to it. Even these days I feel like the Universe is constantly teaching AND testing me. Every time I think, \"I'm so calm or enlightened or wise\" the Universe seems to say \"Oh yeah\" followed by a doozy of a one, two punch... These days I don't try to avoid the punches, I take them square on the chin and react with compassion and kindness. \n\nYou might not be raking in the dough or respect that you'd hoped for, but if you keep true to yourself and your resolve you'll earn both from those (few) who recognize determination and spirit. \n\nIt sounds like you definitely have an ear for listening to the Universe and a mind for \"real\" business. I hope that your endeavors are successful beyond your wildest expectations .", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgsrlf/i_didnt_like_my_life_so_i_quit_my_job_and_became/hbdsijt/"}
