I would have rather have had hard work and years amount to nothing and learn something about doing that - because I'd be in a hole either way if I fail. At least I'd have more experience doing something very difficult in this society. I guess this was just my path and what I had to learn to do what I was meant to do. At least I learned that I am not made for that. \n\nDon't mean to trivialize your experience or anything. I'm sure it's just as soul crushing not succeeding doing what you love, but be glad you have experience in that. It's better to try than to expire with regrets not doing what you loved. I guess the grass is always greener on the other side, heh. \n\nSorry for the wall of text.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgsrlf/i_didnt_like_my_life_so_i_quit_my_job_and_became/hcdaq8v/"}
