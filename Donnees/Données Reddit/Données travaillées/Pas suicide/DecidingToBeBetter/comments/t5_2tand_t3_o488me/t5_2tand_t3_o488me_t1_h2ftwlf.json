If your friend came to you with what you just said would you tear them down or build them up? Be a friend to yourself. Second, don\u2019t look for motivation. It\u2019s like looking for magic. Motivation is cheap and fleeting. Work on habits. I see that you said you fall back into old habits. Work on creating new ones. Start small. Like microscopic. I don\u2019t know what your struggling with but I\u2019ll give you two examples of what I mean. You want to get up at 4am each day and walk. Great! Start getting up just 5 min earlier each day. Then one day start putting out your clothes for your walk. Eventually you will be getting up at 4 am with no problem. Then when you get up at 4 am put on your walking clothes. You don\u2019t have to go for a walk. But look at how far you have come! Then maybe the next day do all of that and walk outside and go 50 feet. Keep building until you reach your goal. You don\u2019t have to change everything all at once. No one ever work up and said \u201ctoday I\u2019m going to the moon!\u201d And just yeeted off of earth. They started small, it took lots of time, years, and lots of failure to get to the moon. But you know what they got there and so will you friend. Start small, celebrating your everyday victories along the way and be kind to yourself. We are all learning every day of our lives.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o488me/im_my_own_biggest_obstacle/h2ftwlf/"}
