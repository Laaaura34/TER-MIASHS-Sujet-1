One of things I have trouble with is finding that balance between being kind and patient enough with myself, and cutting myself _too_ much slack.\n\nI'm struggling with things like finding a job but not really wanting to commit to working (or just being anxious about commiting beforehand, not sure). Or just before I posted, I was deep-cleaning my cupboard and anxiety got to me because I started to think about \"how will I be able to do this in my mom's room when she'll no longer be with us?\", so I got in a bad mood. I also might have a fear of love/relationships which prevents me now from making new connections. Basically I have a lot of issues piled up which can be traced back to a lack of self-confidence, lack of independency and probably some other stuff.\n\nI'm seeing a therapist, but sometimes I have bad hours/days when things seem close to hopeless. Up until recently I thought I believed in myself and had faith, but apparently it \"only\" took a more permanent anxious period to show me that I have more/deeper issues than I thought.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o488me/im_my_own_biggest_obstacle/h2gaidt/"}
