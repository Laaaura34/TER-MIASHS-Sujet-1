Additionally, these judgmental people will tend to lead lives based on following an approved life plan which helps them avoid the harsh judgment they bestow on others more easily. They don\u2019t lead lives that come from exploration of who they are, what they want, or what they ought to do, they want to lead a life which avoids any room for doubt and thereby any opportunity to grow as a person.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Socrates said \u201cthe unexamined life is not worth living\u201d.\n\nThat is because it creates people who lead lives with little self reflection so overall they tend to be uninteresting, shallow assholes.\n\nOP doesn\u2019t need more empathy, OP needs to get over themselves or if someone\u2019s actions are an inconvenience actually address the issue maturely instead of being passive aggressive.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b7j9v7/when_i_have_a_judgmental_thought_about_someone_i/ejso6ad/"}
