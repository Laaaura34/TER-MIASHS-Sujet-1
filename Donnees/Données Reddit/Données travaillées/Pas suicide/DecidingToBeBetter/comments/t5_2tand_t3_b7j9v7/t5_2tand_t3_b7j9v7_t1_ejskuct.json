So, if what someone is doing or saying doesn\u2019t harm you or anything you care about, why concern yourself with it?  You don\u2019t have to assign a good or bad label, or figure it out, just move on. I think that\u2019s an important step in developing empathy- realizing that you can train yourself to stop having such strong opinions and reactions to people or situations that you can\u2019t possibly really know about. Then you can start to choose the way you want to view something- hopefully with more empathy. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b7j9v7/when_i_have_a_judgmental_thought_about_someone_i/ejskuct/"}
