If I were in his shoes I would give you an ultimatum: You either start going to therapy or it\u2019s over. You should also refrain from drinking until you\u2019ve worked through your issues. You can apologize all you want but if you\u2019re not gonna follow through in any meaningful way what good are the words? I had to call it off with my ex because she refused to see a therapist even though she\u2019d regularly explode in anger out of jealousy. Being with her was the most miserable year of my life. Yet I only feel sad that she\u2019s chosen to carry that rage and insecurity with her instead of getting help.\n\nIt\u2019s better to get ahead of it than let it become the pattern of behavior you fear. Best of luck!\n\nEdit: I should mention that I used to have a pattern where I\u2019d become very angry at my parents and siblings. I finally decided to do something about it and saw a therapist for a couple of years. It helped me a lot in managing my emotions as well as those specific relationships. Best money I ever spent because I love my family and was disguated by how I sometimes treated them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os453n/i_abused_him_and_i_feel_terrible/h6ozktp/"}
