Some people never even get there. Get away from the booze. It never added a positive moment to your life or anybody else\u2019s. It\u2019s hard work getting honest with yourself, but once you dive deep into it you\u2019ll thank yourself down the road. We all make mistakes, some worse than others but as long as we learn from them and work on being better that\u2019s all that really matters. Make apologies where they\u2019re needed and focus on yourself. Don\u2019t bring you baggage from the past into a relationship because sooner or later it\u2019ll rear it\u2019s ugly head like it did in your instance. Too many people get into relationships without having their shit together first and 9 times out of 10 it ends up badly.
