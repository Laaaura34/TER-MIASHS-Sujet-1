But I love doing stuff.  Any stuff.  One thing I discovered was that I was a pretty good DJ with a super eclectic taste in music.  And that translated to being a DJ in bars in Chicago. So what did I do?  I worked in bars (the late night bars too) and I had a ball.  I also learned a ton.  But that's a different story. \n\nAnd then, Saturday morning, I dragged my butt out of a really comfy bed in a small apartment and attended my MA classes. 9A on a Saturday morning.  I was tired but I loved it because I felt I was accomplishing something.\n\nMaybe a few concerts now and then ( Fishbone, Rollins, TMBG, Sugar, etc.) but work and school. It really made me feel like I could do anything. \n\nTo me, that was enjoyable.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hcdxqk3/"}
