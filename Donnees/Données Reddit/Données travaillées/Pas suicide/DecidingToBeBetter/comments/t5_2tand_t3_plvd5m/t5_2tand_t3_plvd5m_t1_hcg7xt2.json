Plenty of owner-landlords will be lenient if you are able to, say, pay six months up front (this is less true for property management companies).\n\nThe next best route is to save up enough for 1-2 months in an extended stay hotel or similar facility, and hustle to find a job. This will be more expensive per month, and it will be hard to get an apartment with only a month or so of local work history, but gives you an easier out if you change your mind.\n\nEasy mode is using friends and family to network for jobs and housing, but I'm assuming you want a \"fresh start\" in a city where you don't currently have friends or family.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hcg7xt2/"}
