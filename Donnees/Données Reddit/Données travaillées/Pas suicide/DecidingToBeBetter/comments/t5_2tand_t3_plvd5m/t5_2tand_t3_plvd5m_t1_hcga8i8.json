I have moved away from home at around 20, it was difficult but fun! The only thing is I didn\u2019t really establish myself at all in a career, I was instead sort of floating from industry to industry trying to find what it is I wanted to do with my life. When I turned 26 I moved back home and am now back in school. Once I complete my schooling I 100% plan on moving away again. It\u2019s honestly nice being home because of the family and friends that are already here and never left however I do find that I just don\u2019t really want to spend the rest of my life in the same place. Everyone is different and some of my friends are comfortable here and will most likely never move or leave. I just enjoy experiencing new things, meeting new people, etc. And I look forward to completing school and doing it again :) just wanted to give my personal experience! Hope it helps.
