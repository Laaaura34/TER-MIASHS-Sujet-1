A lot of people mentioned moving to other countries or traveling, teaching abroad makes that possible while being able to earn some money. I did it in Spain, but I know France had a similar program. There are places in South America like Chile that do it too. In Asia I\u2019ve had friends go to Thailand, Vietnam and South Korea (they tend to pay more in Asia).\n\nSometimes you can apply straight through the government or if you want to pay a little bit more, you can through a program like CIEE. I did that my first year and it was helpful. I was supposed to go for a one-year program, and ended up living there for 4 years. I\u2019m fluent in Spanish, got a master\u2019s on the cheap, snd traveled all over Europe and met so many people. Best thing I ever did by far!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hcfxxdz/"}
