The job itself was lame (it was in a gift shop), but the experience was literally the best thing ever. It\u2019s been over two years and I still think about it daily. I lived in a big dorm house with 24 other employees, got so close with them, partied and hiked in this beautiful landscape. Even when we weren\u2019t doing anything, we were just enjoying each other\u2019s company in the most beautiful place I\u2019d ever seen. It was at a time when I needed to find myself a bit and it definitely helped.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hcfer2g/"}
