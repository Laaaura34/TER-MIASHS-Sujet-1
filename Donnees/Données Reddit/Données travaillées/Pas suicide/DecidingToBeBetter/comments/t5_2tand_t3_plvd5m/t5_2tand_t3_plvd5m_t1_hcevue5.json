That year was one of the most eye opening and entertaining year of my life.\n\nI've since quit taking those as it makes the mind funky if you do it too much, but I'll never forget how amazing it was just to have that type of perceptions and how hilarious it was to look out my window, look at the trees and feel like they were looking at me too and I'd just laugh my ass off. Or when I was on 4-Aco-DMT and when I would try and roll a joint the grinder weed would appear to have eyes shifting around and that made me feel kinda bad at the moment\n\nWithout a doubt I'll experience greater and better things in the future, but 2019 will always stick out to me for how fun and goofy it was.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hcevue5/"}
