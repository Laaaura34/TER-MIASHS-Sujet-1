I\u2019ve always lived alone and been independent but it really takes it up a notch moving away and especially far away from friends and family. Getting sick is hard, time zone changes suck, sometimes you\u2019ll get lonely or home sick. \n\nBut there\u2019s a lot of growth and pride that comes with doing something like that. Many people say it\u2019s brave and courageous but it\u2019s scary and a big risk but if you\u2019re strategic and do it for the right reasons it is a really amazing reward to be so independent and experience a new part of the country or world.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hcg9iks/"}
