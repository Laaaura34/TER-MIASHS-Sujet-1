A lot of my friends thought I was crazy to do it but I haven\u2019t regretted it once. My husband and I figured that if there\u2019s one time to live in NYC it\u2019s before we settle down and have kids and we couldn\u2019t be more grateful that we did. We were able to do so much and get to see the museums, the plays, the parks and all the landmarks so often and the restaurant scene is unparalleled. If you ever get the chance and a job that pays decently, definitely consider!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hcfzvhc/"}
