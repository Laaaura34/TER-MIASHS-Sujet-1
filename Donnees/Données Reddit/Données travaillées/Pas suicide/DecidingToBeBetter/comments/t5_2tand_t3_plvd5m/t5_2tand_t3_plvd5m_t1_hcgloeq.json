I have lots of acquaintances, but only a few close friends. I don't think that's uncommon as an adult though, so I can't say that's just limited to moving.\n\n\\-Finding new doctors that I liked (esp because I moved from NY to Oklahoma...I had to find doctors who were equally liberal/forward thinking/non-religious)\n\n\\-Understanding the new rules around car registration, licenses, etc. NY to OK was my second move, first I did NY to PA. Each state has different requirements, and no matter where you go, the DMV ain't fun\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould I do it again?  \n\\-3,000% yes. I hope to do it again before my husband and I retire. That's actually the only reason I settled down in one place, I met my husband here. His work requires him to stay here, so we stay. But if I was still single, I'd probably be moving cities/states every 5 years or so. I like exploring new places!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hcgloeq/"}
