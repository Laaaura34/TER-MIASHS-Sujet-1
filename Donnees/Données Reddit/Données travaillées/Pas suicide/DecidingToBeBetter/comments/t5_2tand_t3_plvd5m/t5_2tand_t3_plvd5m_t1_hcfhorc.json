We got pretty high up in the Fandom, so we're invited to other cons like Dragon Con, Comic Con, etc as VIP guest, sent down to both Wizarding Worlds for the grand openings on Warner Brothers dime..... and if you know anyone who's gone to any sort of cons you know the parties are legit (similar, just less fashionable than festivals)\n\nI had the unique experience of being a \"trendy\" person (worked managing high end restaurants/ night clubs) but would spend all my vacations parting with the nerdiest people on earth and they're honestly my best friends. My life at home and my HP life look very different\n\nHonestly, your 20s are for figuring out who you want to be and being truly free of serious commitments.
