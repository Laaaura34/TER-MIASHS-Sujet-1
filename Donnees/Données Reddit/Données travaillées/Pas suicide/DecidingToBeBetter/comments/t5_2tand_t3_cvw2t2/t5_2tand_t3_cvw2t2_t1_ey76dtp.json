I\u2019ve had a friend for a long long time who I just don\u2019t like hanging out with and to be honest don\u2019t even like that much. I used to look up to him in school and basically tied my self worth to what he (and other friends) thought. I\u2019ve decided to finally stop seeing him as that\u2019s what I think is best for me. Him and my other friends will probably not understand but I\u2019m doing it for me. It is still hard not to tie my self worth to what others think tho\n\nThanks for the advice. I\u2019ll try what you suggest", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cvw2t2/im_soft/ey76dtp/"}
