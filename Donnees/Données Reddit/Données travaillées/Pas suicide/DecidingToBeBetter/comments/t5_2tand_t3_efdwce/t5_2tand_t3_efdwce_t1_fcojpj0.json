Any advice/tips are super welcome, and thank you, sincerely, for offering to be there... of all the people I know who use, I\u2019m the only one stopping, so it\u2019s a pretty lonely path from the looks of it right now. Really just trying to make a plan for establishing new non-sexual orientation based friends (I\u2019m a gay dude and meth is rampant where I live), considering making a move to someplace new... just one day sober and the flood of thoughts I\u2019ve been keeping at bay with my use are coming right back. Anyways, thanks again, your kindness means more to me than you\u2019ll probably ever know.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/efdwce/day_365_of_quitting_meth_im_officially_one_year/fcojpj0/"}
