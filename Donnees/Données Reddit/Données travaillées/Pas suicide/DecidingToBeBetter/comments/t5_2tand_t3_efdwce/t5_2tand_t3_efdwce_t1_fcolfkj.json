A huge thanks for those tips! \n\nGod willing we\u2019ll both be able to look back on all of this and just be grateful we made it out alive man. I know I sure as fuck am BLOWN away at the fact that I made it this far with no serious consequences... aside from destroying my body and brain I guess. Whatever your religious beliefs and whatever deities you pray to, I hope they continue to guide you along the path you\u2019ve chosen. You\u2019re truly an inspiration and your kindness really is making a big difference for me right now. Truthfully, I\u2019ve been debating making that call as midnight approaches. Reading your story really makes me realize how attainable sobriety is and how worth it it will be once I\u2019m there. Mi amigo, you\u2019re a good man, and a walking inspiration. Thank you, so much \ud83d\ude4f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/efdwce/day_365_of_quitting_meth_im_officially_one_year/fcolfkj/"}
