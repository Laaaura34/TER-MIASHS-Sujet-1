It kept me sane when I had to drop my old friends because none of them wanted to quit smoking with me. Even when I made it known that I was going to quit, they never respected my wishes. \n\n\nChillZone really helped me. On god bro. I made so many friends there that I still talk to today. It\u2019s one of my favorite places to go to whenever I feel alone or when I want to talk to people.\n\n\nAnother thing you\u2019ll have to note, there is a VERY VERY high chance you will relapse. Meth is a fucking beast of a drug. It took me a whole 6 months of saying that I\u2019d go sober before I actually did. Now I can\u2019t even stomach the thought of even hitting a piece. And even though I\u2019m not where I want to be right now, I\u2019m sure as hell in a fucking better place than I was last year. If I can do it so can you. I have nothing but absolute faith in you, friendo \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udd25\n\nAnd seriously, hit me up anytime. I want nothing but for you to succeed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/efdwce/day_365_of_quitting_meth_im_officially_one_year/fcokpyr/"}
