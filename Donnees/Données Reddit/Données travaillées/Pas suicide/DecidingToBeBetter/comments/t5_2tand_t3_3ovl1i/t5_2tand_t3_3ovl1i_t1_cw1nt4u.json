I have made a directed effort to *unfollow* a lot of my \"friends\" on Facebook so I don't see my feed cluttered with shared pictures of minions or other clutter that I have no interest in.\n\nI've unliked everything: TV shows, games, books, et cetera. I've left every group. I find that when I do go to Facebook now, it's much less frantic and spam-ridden.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ovl1i/the_world_is_addicted_to_facebook/cw1nt4u/"}
