If I could would only eat sugar and carbs. But guess what?  I am very fortunate that my body has a very definitive way of telling me that all that crap is poison. I found that upping my probiotics was helpful in terms of reducing my cravings. (Not a doctor; not trying to give medical advice; just saying what has worked for me). And Alsop there are the pre-biotics. These are also very important to helping our bodies to crave less of that evil sugar fix. Plus staying hydrated can also lessen cravings. These are the tactics that worked for me. And as others have mentioned, a complete \u2018fasting\u2019 re: carbs and sugar can help diminish the cravings. I feel very fortunate that my body viscerally reacts to sugar and loudly tells me NO!  Those signals have helped me to be super aware of the immediate and detrimental effects of sugar.
