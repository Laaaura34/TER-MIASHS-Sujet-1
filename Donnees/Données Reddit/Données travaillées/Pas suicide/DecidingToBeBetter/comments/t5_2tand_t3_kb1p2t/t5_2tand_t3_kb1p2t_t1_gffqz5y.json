I was into WoW 30 years ago, just before it became an online thing. It's quite addictive and I had to put it down after being consumed by it for a while. \n\nI had to back of Facebook as I realized it was not good for me. I'm much more casual now about it, mostly checking up on friends and family. \n\nI like reading Reddit when I'm doing my business.
