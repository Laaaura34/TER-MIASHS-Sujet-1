We'd go around the world and play hide and seek or just explore every nook and cranny. Our favorite spot was in bc nagrand on one of the floating islands, had a tree and we'd sit on a branch together.\n\nOctober 2011, one of the friends was driving back from a wedding and got hit by a drunk truck driver. She died on impact.\n\nThe other friend and I put our characters on that tree branch and logged off from the server forever.\n\nIt's been 9 years and I still miss her, she was an amazing person.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kb1p2t/deleted_all_world_of_warcraft_characters_and/gff22tg/"}
