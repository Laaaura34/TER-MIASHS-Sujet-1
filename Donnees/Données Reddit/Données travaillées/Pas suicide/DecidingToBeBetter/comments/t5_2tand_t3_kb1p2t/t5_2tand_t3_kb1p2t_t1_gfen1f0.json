Good for you for being able to break free. Games are fun, but addictions are not. Needless to say, games, Facebook, Reddit!, etc. operate on an engagement model designed to lure you in and keep you coming back.

Keep doing positive stuff, the world needs you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kb1p2t/deleted_all_world_of_warcraft_characters_and/gfen1f0/"}
