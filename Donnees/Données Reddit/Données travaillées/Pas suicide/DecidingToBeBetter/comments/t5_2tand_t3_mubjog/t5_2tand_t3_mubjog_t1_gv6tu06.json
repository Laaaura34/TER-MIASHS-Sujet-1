Any type of activity, no matter how small, is better than nothing. Walk circles round the parking lot if you have too. Try parking your car ten minutes away from home so you have to walk a bit more. Regular excerise has been a game changer for me. It impoved my sleep (much easier to go to bed early when you are tired), eating habits (less comfort/junk food) and general overall mood.
