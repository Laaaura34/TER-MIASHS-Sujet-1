I was depressed and as stupid as it sounds I honestly didn\u2019t know it. A close friend that was a doctor started talking to me and it was true I was depressed. I went and got some medicine. ( There is such a stigma that surrounds depression, medication, etc. I believe people don\u2019t try to help themselves in this way and it does help. At least it did for me.) But it took a lot more also. I didn\u2019t just feel suddenly happy and have a different life. I still had to decide what I wanted to do and motivate myself and be diligent about trying to achieve what I wanted my life to be. Some days are certainly easier than others. You have a lot of ups and downs...you just have to make up your mind to deal with it how you would have it be. For myself I will always have this illness? I guess that\u2019s what you call it and everyday I deal with it. So I am saying how you feel might not go away forever...but it can get better if you try and keep trying.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mubjog/how_do_i_break_this_cycle_of_me_doing_nothing/gv501ic/"}
