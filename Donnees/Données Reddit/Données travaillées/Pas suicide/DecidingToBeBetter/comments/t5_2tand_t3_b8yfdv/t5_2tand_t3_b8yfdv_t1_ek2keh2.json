I am very glad to hear that you\u2019re not as anxious as you were, and that you\u2019re seeing someone about it. That\u2019s excellent, my friend! \n\nI\u2019ll share my experience as well. I\u2019m not the one with anxiety- it\u2019s my man. And for him, this is different. He doesn\u2019t get anxiety that is related to anything that is happening or that he needs to do or deal with. What happens with him is that he gets overwhelming anxiety for literally no reason. He feels a sense of impending doom come out of nowhere. It\u2019s a result of having a mother with a personality disorder who was emotionally abusive and maybe even physically abusive. I mean, she didn\u2019t hit him, but he does have physical scars from her not getting him proper medical attention many times when he was sick or needed medical attention. Therefore, he is physically damaged as well as emotionally. Sorry if that\u2019s TMI, I\u2019m just trying to explain the way he experiences anxiety, and be as open as you were with me. But she was so harmful that it\u2019s almost like he has internalized a sense of when to expect the chaos- like her moods are a weather system or the tides and he can feel when something is overdue for some total insanity. But we have cut her out of our life, and we don\u2019t need to be hyper vigilant and watch for impending drama and pain anymore. And yet, he gets this feeling like things are about to go off the rails. \n\nSo you can see why I am critical of the idea that he is nervous that he doesn\u2019t have the skills to handle something or he\u2019s in over his head and that\u2019s what is causing anxiety. So, my comment was basically just me saying sometimes people are just anxious, and it doesn\u2019t logically follow that he must have something to worry about. \n\nThanks so much for reaching out and sharing your experience with a stranger! I\u2019m totally open to continuing to chat about this, and/or to hear advice on what people think we could do to help his anxiety.
