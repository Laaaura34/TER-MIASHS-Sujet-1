Over the past few years my therapist recommended something called an anxiety ladder to help me. It's changed my life.\n\nThe anxiety ladder is a list of tasks that give you anxiety. You rank them from \"only causes a tiny little bit of anxiety\" to \"blackout terror\".\n\nYou then work your way up the ladder slowly. The point isn't that you dont have skill if you have anxiety. It's that if you're extremely scared in a situation your skills will not shine through.\n\nTherefore it's necessary to start with \"low skill events\"  (making small talk with a cashier) and slowly over time move to the \"high skill events\" (talking in front of a big group)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b8yfdv/if_you_constantly_feel_bored_you_probably_need_to/ek2ifkh/"}
