There is a very important distinction between true happiness, and excitement. Happiness isn't excitement, our low consciousness mind loves chasing excitement in life and less so real happiness because we don't understand what it means to be happy. \n\nAnd okay with the fishing example, someone may love fishing for the excitement of catching something, which is the same thing as the car example, but some people may enjoy the quietness of sitting there in the ocean waiting, and being present, as a time to be mindful. Nobody needs a boat for that, if someone thinks they need to save up for years for some peace of mind then they're highly mistaken and tricking themselves! You can simply make your bedroom or wherever a peaceful environment and meditate, or write in a journal. You can be mindful anywhere.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b8yfdv/if_you_constantly_feel_bored_you_probably_need_to/ek32603/"}
