Does he talk about her ever?  Does he have any avoidance issues like shutting down or procrastinating on things that need to be done?  My coping mechanism was to avoid my mom, which became how I coped with any problem.  So what I\u2019m getting at is are there any things like that for him?

You\u2019ve identified where the problem came from, so now it\u2019s time to figure out why the problem is still a part of him, what causes it and how to fix it.
