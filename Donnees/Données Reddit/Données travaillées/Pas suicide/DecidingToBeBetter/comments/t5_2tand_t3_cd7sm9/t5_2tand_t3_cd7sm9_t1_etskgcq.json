I think that's step one. do something with your life that will make you happy and feel good about yourself, whatever that means for you. if you hate that you watch porn then maybe you should cut back. start exercising, work on yourself. figure out all the things wrong with your life that you can control or change by yourself and do them first. people are drawn to confidence and people with interesting hobbies and lives, people who take care of themselves and inspire others to be better. use your spite and self-annoyance to be hard on yourself and make some big changes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cd7sm9/i_feel_purposelessemptyworthless_and_i_have_no/etskgcq/"}
