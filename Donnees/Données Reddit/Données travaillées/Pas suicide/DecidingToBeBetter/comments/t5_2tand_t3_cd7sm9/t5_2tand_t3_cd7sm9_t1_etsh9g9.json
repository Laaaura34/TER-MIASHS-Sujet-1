Do this 2x a week.\n\nstep 6: keep pushing yourself in at least one hobby. look up tutorials on youtube on how to get better and put in the work. you can learn anything these days.\n\nstep 7: slowly introduce socializing back into your life. pay attention to people\u2019s reactions. see what works and what doesn\u2019t. don\u2019t be clingy\n\nstep 8: this is you probably a year from now. you are a new person.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cd7sm9/i_feel_purposelessemptyworthless_and_i_have_no/etsh9g9/"}
