I know this because reading you felt a lot like reading myself ages ago.\n\nSecond: cut that bs mindset from your life, is not doing any good to you. Treating or even talking about yourself in a destructive way would not help you at all.\n\nBeing kind to you does, lifting up your self steem does, bringing up your value, reconnecting with your purpose, set the correct goals and actually see yourself thrive.\n\nYou can live a really f****** amazing life, you just need the knowledge on how to, the willingness to want it, and the guide to accomplish it.\n\nI'm a coach so in case you need any help just reach out to me in a pm. Id like to help you out. \n\nCheers bro\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cd7sm9/i_feel_purposelessemptyworthless_and_i_have_no/ett8r11/"}
