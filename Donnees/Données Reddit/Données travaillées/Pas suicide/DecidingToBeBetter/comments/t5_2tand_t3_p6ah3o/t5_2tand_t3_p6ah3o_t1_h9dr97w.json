I did not attend my step-grandfather's funeral because I was so angry at life for loosing him. I could not have imagined my life without him. He was one of my bright spots and the only man who helped raise me as my father lived on the opposite side of the world at that time. I was not able to express it at that time, but I was angry. I felt betrayed by life itself.\n\nSomeone shared a beautiful saying with me one time; \"A caterpillar, when it turns into a cocoon, before it re-emerges the world as a butterfly, must think that it is dying...\"\n\nI had to learn that I would actually be OK without my Grandfather. I learned to rely on myself, made new friends, found new passions. And his memory is still fully alive. I even write him periodically to update him as the relationship is still fully alive inside me. Live is magic and a beautiful mystery.\n\nLetting go of my anger and learning to trust myself and life allowed me to turn my life around and to start living it for me. You have so many beautiful chapters ahead. None or most which you cannot yet see!\n\nGet in touch with what fulfills you. I just created a video about the pursuit of fulfillment.  I did not pursue this until much later in life. If you get connected to it you will have a huge head-start on most!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obNb9bu6IFw", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p6ah3o/ive_late_20s_f_dropped_everything_this_is_going/h9dr97w/"}
