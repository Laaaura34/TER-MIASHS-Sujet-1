I went through a similar decline when my father died. Gained 70lbs, wallowed in my depression, cultivated a nice alcohol problem, and made excuses for myself. Then my best friend in the whole world died. The love of my life. After that happened, I knew I had to force myself to change for the better or the decline would quite literally kill me. And I couldn\u2019t do my best friend\u2019s memory like that. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m perfect right now, but the motivation to even want to change for the better is so much easier to work with.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p6ah3o/ive_late_20s_f_dropped_everything_this_is_going/h9erji1/"}
