My first year after college I went deep into books about philosophy and psychology and became really argumentative and started to focus on setting peoples facts straight until my father told me I was becoming really annoying, and eventually it was going to affect the way I connect to people.\n\nI think being aware of it is a really good step. Technically what you have to do is just hold your opinion for yourself and realize that some people just dont need to hear the truth, or your opinion, perspective as helpful as it might be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of books the one I think would help you the most is [Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Meditations/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason being that if the emperor of one of the most powerful empires took time out of his day to write down the ways he was flawed or unintelligent, it makes it easier for you to reflect on your own \"humanity \" rather than your knowledge and how are you better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope it helps, good luck !
