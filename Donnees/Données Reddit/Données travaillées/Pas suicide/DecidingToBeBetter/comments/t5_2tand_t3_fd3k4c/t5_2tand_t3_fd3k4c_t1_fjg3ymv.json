Life is going to kick you in the ass, and you\u2019ll never be able to figure out how to get through it if you don\u2019t take it down a notch. \n\nAnyway, read a book about something you think you\u2019re a) not interested in because it\u2019s not important to you, and/or b) already think you know a lot about. You\u2019ll be surprised by how much you learn. Also, watch Carl Sagan\u2019s Cosmos. It may not have the same effect for you as it does for me, but I find his attitude of humility and wonder in the face of a big universe really grounding. Cosmos isn\u2019t totally up to date in its science, but it introduces some big ideas that make you think and has a nice aesthetic.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd3k4c/ive_noticed_myself_getting_a_little_too/fjg3ymv/"}
