Approach all interactions with this mindset. \n\nA humbling insight for me was when I recognized a simple fact. Everyone you meet knows things you have no clue about. Perhaps they're not well-versed in the subjects that are your strong points but they could school you on other subjects. Your friend might not know as much about politics as you, but he's legitimately an expert on finishing hardwood floors. Once you recognize that everyone you meet knows stuff you don't know, try propping them up and asking questions to let them talk about stuff that makes them feel smart. Finally, try to learn something new from these people. Listen more than you talk and try your hardest to not correct them unless it's absolutely critical. You're not going to be perfect but you'll get better over time and see the value of this way of thinking.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd3k4c/ive_noticed_myself_getting_a_little_too/fjfjtso/"}
