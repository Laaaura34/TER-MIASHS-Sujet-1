It\u2019s fiction so it\u2019s easy reading, but it\u2019s impossible not to feel humbled and compassionate after reading it. Ignore the Christian overtones if you like-I\u2019m an atheist who read the book for a college lit class-the message of faith in humanity is still powerful.\n\nIt also won a Pulitzer, so, ya know, it\u2019s not just me who thought it was good ;-)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd3k4c/ive_noticed_myself_getting_a_little_too/fjfqzv3/"}
