What has helped me is to slowly train myself to ask myself questions. Why I am trying to be right? Where is this need to correct another person coming from? For me (and this may be not even remotely applicable to you- just throwing it out there) I find I am often feeling insecure in some way. If I am afraid someone isn\u2019t taking me seriously or if I am not feeling likable or struggling to connect in a more personal way, my knee jerk reaction is to at least be the smartest person in the room. The more I get comfortable with myself the easier it is to let things go (still hard though, lol). \n\nOne trick I have used to get myself out of feeling competitive is to use my curiosity. You can simultaneously learn more about the world and make people feel good around you if you ask them questions about what THEY know or experiences they have had that you haven\u2019t.\n\nAlso- sometimes people may react badly to your intelligence only because they are insecure about their own- and this is not really your problem. \n\nAlso Also- I think you are awesome for recognizing this part of yourself and working on it- that is hard to do, so good job!!!\n\nEdit- you asked for references- Perhaps check out the Shadow Effect by Deepak Chopra and Marianne Williams", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd3k4c/ive_noticed_myself_getting_a_little_too/fjf5bcu/"}
