Honestly, it's a wonderful read and I'd recommend it. \n\nComing to your problem, there's a chapter on it which touches upon how we value being right over being happy. It opened my eyes. It helped me draw the line between self confidence and ego, and I honestly think I've become a better listener.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd3k4c/ive_noticed_myself_getting_a_little_too/fjgwjge/"}
