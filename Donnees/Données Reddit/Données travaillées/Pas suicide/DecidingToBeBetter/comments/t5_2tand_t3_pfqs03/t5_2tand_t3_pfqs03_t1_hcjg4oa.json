I didn't respond then, but when you posted this, it gave me the kick I needed to go on the run I was putting off that day.\n\nI still worry that what little I'm doing isn't \"enough\" though. Like, maybe I feel that way because it's not extreme and causing huge visible changes? But I'm scared I'll end up one of the people riding scooters around Walmart anyway, because I'm not pushing myself hard enough.\n\nI seem to have two modes - 1. full throttle killing myself pushing to the absolute limit, and 2. completely doing nothing/giving up. I waver between those modes on a daily basis and its exhausting. I know I need to find a middle ground or I'll just continue that burnout cycle.  \nI've been trying really hard to hit a middle ground with this weight loss thing because I remember how unsustainable my old method was when I was very mentally unwell, but my brain keeps insisting that if I'm not flooring the metaphorical accelerator, then I'm not doing enough.
