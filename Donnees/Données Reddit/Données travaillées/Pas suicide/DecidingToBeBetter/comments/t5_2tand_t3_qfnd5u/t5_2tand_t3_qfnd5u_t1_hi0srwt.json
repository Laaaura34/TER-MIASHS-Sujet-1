Relax your whole body let it flop.\n\nYou know when someone pretends to be asleep but you see the eyes flicker and move about because they're awake. It's because they are engaged with their sense of sight (and awake) another factor is trying to disengage with your vision and be head to toe fully relax and floppy. \n\nWhen i lay down i think of turning myself into a bellows (big bag to blow flames) and extend my breathing to 'all the way in and all the way out' on every steady breathe of 4-6 seconds. I relax starting from my toes - legs - torso - arms - shoulders - Neck - head - mouth and jaw - eyes. Ignore all itches (unless pain) try not to flex a single muscle keep focus on the breathing once you clock how to relax your eyes.\n\nSometimes focusing on a texture across your large toe (like your bed cover) with a very slight wiggle, I'm talking 1mm max it's amazing the focus in texture feel lol but it helped me relax my eyes near the end.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfnd5u/how_do_you_stay_focused_on_breathing_during/hi0srwt/"}
