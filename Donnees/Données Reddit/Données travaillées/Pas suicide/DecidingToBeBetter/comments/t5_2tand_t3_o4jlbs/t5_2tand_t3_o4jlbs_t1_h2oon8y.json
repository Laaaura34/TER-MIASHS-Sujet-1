Today is day 2 for me and I'm taking it minute by minute. Felt kinda bad and restless yesterday, but I want to be a better me. The amount of lost potential depresses me, but I'm trying to push that into motivation. I have an awesome partner and I would hate myself so much if I lost her because of being a lazy immature adult who can't handle emotions. Drinking lots of water and cut down on my coffee. I typically need 2 cups just to clear some of the brain fog, but today I only needed one. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4jlbs/after_10_years_ive_decided_to_give_up_marijuana/h2oon8y/"}
