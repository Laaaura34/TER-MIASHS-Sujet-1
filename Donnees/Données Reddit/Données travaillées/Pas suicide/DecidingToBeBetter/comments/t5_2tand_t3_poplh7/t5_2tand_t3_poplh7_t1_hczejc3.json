If you eventually want to have a bunch of hobbies, then one day start by making a list of potential hobbies then the next day write out what the first step is to getting involved for each of them, then the next day narrow it down to 1 or 2 , etc. keep making plans, think it through, re-evaluate, make a different plan, just try to be moving slowly towards your goals every day.
