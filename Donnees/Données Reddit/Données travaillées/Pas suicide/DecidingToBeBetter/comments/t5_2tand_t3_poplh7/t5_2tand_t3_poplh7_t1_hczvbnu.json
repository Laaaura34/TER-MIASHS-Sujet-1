It\u2019s hard when you feel like there is no point in doing any activities. I have been in your position before, and I\u2019d like to share some things to help. \n\n1) Hang in there. With all your might. When you get through this, you\u2019ll be so proud of your resilience & strength. You are suffering from an illness, so don\u2019t under estimate how amazing you are for fighting - even if you don\u2019t feel like you are amazing. \n\n2) Do small things every day, and write them down AFTER you\u2019ve done them. Review at the end of the day. If you\u2019re feeling positive in the morning, write down 3 things you\u2019d like to accomplish in the day but keep them simple ie \u2018go for a walk\u2019 or \u2018write for 15 minutes\u2019. To-do lists can compound feelings of failure. \n\n3) MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL: think of 3 things that make you happy every day. Write them down. Absolutely no excuses. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s \u2018the colour of the sky\u2019; this simple method will \u2018trip\u2019 your brain out of its negative cycle. \n\n4) You will not feel like exercising, but just decide to do it. I know you don\u2019t want to, but try and force yourself too. You\u2019ll be surprised at the difference you feel. \n\nGood luck & all the best in your recovery. You\u2019ve got this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poplh7/what_are_some_simple_or_easy_things_i_can_do_to/hczvbnu/"}
