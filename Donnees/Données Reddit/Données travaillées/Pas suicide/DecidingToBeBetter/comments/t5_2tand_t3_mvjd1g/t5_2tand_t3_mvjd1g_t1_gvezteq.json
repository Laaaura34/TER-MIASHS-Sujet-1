This is HUGE. Do not underestimate what an achievement it is to look at yourself with an outside point of view, evaluate, and make changes for the better. That's such a big deal!!! This is a great thing to change, too. As someone from the south, I truly can not articulate how proud of you I am. Keep it up! Lead by example and hopefully more will follow. Much love to you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mvjd1g/got_rid_of_the_last_of_my_confederate_stuff/gvezteq/"}
