I\u2019ve always been against racism. I came to understand how deep the interlining of hate and that symbol are for some people, and so I don\u2019t show any of it anymore. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that never once have I used it to represent hate or have been hateful.\n\nIf someone has a model car of the car from Dukes of Hazard, is that hate? Is a Lyndard Skynard CD hateful? I have a cigar box, the only thing I kept with the flag on it, hand painted by an old friend; is that racist? \n\nLabeling everyone who uses it as heritage, as being hateful, alienate them right into the arms of the alt right.
