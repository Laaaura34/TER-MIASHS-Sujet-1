One of my friends is an ex-neo Nazi. \n\nHe still sometimes says ignorant things, but people are patient with him because he has a whole childhood of hate to undo. (His whole family are right-wing extremists he doesn't talk to anymore.) \n\nIt's great that you're taking this step. Don't expect to change everything overnight though. There's a reason why people turn out racist in the first place. Be sure to surround yourself with patient people.\n\nI am also happy to recommend reading materials on various social justice topics if you are interested.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mvjd1g/got_rid_of_the_last_of_my_confederate_stuff/gvcrujh/"}
