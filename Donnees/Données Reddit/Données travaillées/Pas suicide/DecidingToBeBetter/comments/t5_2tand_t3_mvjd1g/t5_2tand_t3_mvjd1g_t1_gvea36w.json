It\u2019s obviously partial in its perspective, but more complete than the history books I used in school. \n\nNot only did it teach me a lot of history, the biggest take away was how much history can be re-painted and misremembered to portray one perspective (the \u201cVictor\u2019s\u201d), and make it seem much neater than it was.  Of course we know this is done, but to read stories from the other side gives one a better sense of the surprising degree to which books are whitewashed.
