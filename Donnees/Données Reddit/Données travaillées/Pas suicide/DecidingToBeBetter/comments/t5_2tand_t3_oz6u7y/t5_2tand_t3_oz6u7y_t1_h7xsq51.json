But unfortunately I can't really do what you suggested. Or well, I tried. But my parents are really... how do you even call it? They don't believe that depression is as complex as it is. They are just shaming me for being lazy and not doing anything, and whenever I try explaining my situation to them, they refuse to listen. I actually thought about running away from home because they are *that* emotionally draining. They give me a bunch of chores to do and if I refuse to do even one because I'm not feeling well enough, then I get called lazy and useless and whatever, and I still have to do it because they just won't shut up and leave me alone. I honestly don't know what to do about this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz6u7y/how_to_force_myself_to_do_things/h7xsq51/"}
