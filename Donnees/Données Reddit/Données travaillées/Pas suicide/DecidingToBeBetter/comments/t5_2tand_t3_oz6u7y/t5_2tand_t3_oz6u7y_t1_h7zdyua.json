Any job CAN be stressful, but many jobs aren\u2019t stressful most of the time.\n\nThe key things to look for are kind coworkers and reasonable manager - it\u2019s ok to interview the interviewer a bit to find out their expectations and management style.\n\nWhat you find stressful personally also depends on your personality. Some people love \u201cpeople\u201d jobs with lots of customer interaction, others hate it. Some enjoy a fast pace so the time flies, others like steady and predictable. Use what you know about yourself to choose.\n\nA coffee shop is a great choice if you like being social and alternating between very busy and a slower pace. Landscaping or painting work are better if you prefer physical demands over fast pace and social stress.\n\nI\u2019ve had both kinds of jobs. I tend to do better with a steady pace and control over how I work, but I can do either without getting too stressed out when the coworkers and manager were good.
