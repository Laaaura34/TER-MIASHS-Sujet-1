I also think that going outside and socializing can really help. maybe a local board game group? you can just focus on the game and usually board game ppl are kind of nerdy and will prob be ok if ur really quiet.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz6u7y/how_to_force_myself_to_do_things/h7yzb38/"}
