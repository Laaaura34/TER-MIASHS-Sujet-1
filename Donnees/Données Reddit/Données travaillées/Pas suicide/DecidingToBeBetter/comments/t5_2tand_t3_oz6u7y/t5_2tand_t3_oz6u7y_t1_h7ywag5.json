Anything that gets you off your phone - cleaning, baking, long walks, gardening a small vegetable patch.\n\nIt literally does not matter what it is. The point is it should occupy your time and get you mentally and physically engaged. It\u2019s best if you can do it together with someone and have social connections as well.\n\nTake note of how you feel after the hour or hours of activity, versus how you feel after equivalent time on your phone. Recognize the good feelings you get for activity and social connections, and use that as a tool to force yourself to do other stuff that\u2019s good for you - like getting a job or an education, maintaining your health, helping your parents, or making friends.\n\nSitting at home on your phone and doing nothing else isn\u2019t living. It\u2019s a form of self-sabotage, a depression trigger (or exacerbating existing depression), and is essentially checking out on life. Don\u2019t waste your youth. Decide to do something with it. If you feel incapable of being happy yourself right now, try making others happy first. \n\nAnd based on your description, it might be a good idea to talk to a doctor about your mental state, and see if therapy or antidepressants are a good choice.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz6u7y/how_to_force_myself_to_do_things/h7ywag5/"}
