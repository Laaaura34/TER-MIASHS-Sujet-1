I'm not a psychologist but the best I can describe it is that it's easier to hide from your problems or from hard work via escapism than it is to saddle up and start making the calls, putting in the applications, interviewing, etc. Look at me, on Reddit while I should be sending out emails and making calls to my accounts to fill my pipeline lol.\n\nTry setting small goals each day. Just do one job application today. Try two tomorrow and if you only do one then so be it. But try and keep it at a steady increase until you're at least putting a few in each day. Make it a routine or habit, the first thing you do each day whether you wake up at 8AM or 12PM. For interviews look up a generic set of interview questions and just practice answering the ones you can answer. Emphasize that while you don't have experience, you're making changes to your life and you're ready to work and learn. The first step is the hardest but it becomes easier after every successive step. Retail or grocery stores would be a good place to start.
