Without more details it\u2019s hard to say, and understandable that sometimes you get to a place where even the effort to type a longer post seems daunting. I\u2019d suggest trying to start with one thing a day that you don\u2019t do now but you are aware you should: brush your teeth, take a shower, do one chore\u2026just choose one thing. Try to repeat that for a week but don\u2019t get discouraged if you can\u2019t do it. If your parents are approachable, or if one of them is, maybe talk to them and let them know you need some support. How you feel on the inside isn\u2019t visible to others: they see what looks like a lack of motivation or laziness and that\u2019s not it at all. It\u2019s a treatable problem but having support is helpful. Conversely, it\u2019s unhelpful and can make things worse when you\u2019re in that place to have people hounding you about why you\u2019re not doing x, y, and z. Maybe the next time they bring it up, is your opening to talk about your struggles (I\u2019d say less is more in that conversation though, depending on your relationship, they don\u2019t need all of the details of your inner life and self, just enough to understand why you\u2019re not able to do all of the things they think you should be doing - maybe just let them know you need help finding a provider for your mental health without stating the exact nature of the issue). Good luck and please know this is super common.\n\nEdit: I looked at your post history. You likely have some trauma issues specifically involving your parents and unresolved feelings about neglect or feeling unloved, which is very legitimate and can cause a lot of problems if it isn\u2019t addressed, so I\u2019d  try reading some posts on r/CPTSD and see if and of it resonates. And consider the fact that you\u2019ve even figured this out an accomplishment. Not everyone is able to identify the root or source of their depression, anxiety, or discontent at such a young age. You\u2019re other posts demonstrate that you\u2019re quite intelligent and mature. You\u2019re more aware and introspective than a lot of your peers (and I certainly mean no offense to all young people, but your prefrontal cortex isn\u2019t finished developing yet so your brain is literally still a work in progress). Once you\u2019ve identified the cause or the trauma, you can help yourself find the best path to get yourself to a better place mentally. That path looks different for everyone because even if we experienced the same exact trauma, the way it impacted or affects us individually is different. You can do this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz6u7y/how_to_force_myself_to_do_things/h7xrtr5/"}
