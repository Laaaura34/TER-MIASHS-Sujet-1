You're moving in the right direction it sounds like. I appreciate you acknowledging those things as well, it's something most people are incredibly reticent to admit (understandably so) which sometimes has a negative effect on my motivation, so again thank you.\n\nIf you want any advice about dieting or exercise feel free to ping me anytime, many people feel relatively comfortable in their understanding of healthy eating & fitness but can sometimes get important things wrong so I'll just give my little spiel for my general recommendation in case it's of any help to you: 50% varied veggies, 25% fruits & nuts, 25% meat/junk/etc - for fitness a minimum of 15 minutes of quality stretching and 15 minutes of relatively intense and continuous cardio. Of course feel free to tack on anything else to reach your specific goals like resistance training.\n\nYou got this!
