I deleted instagram over a year ago, and I will never ever go back. I can't speak for the experience men face, but as a woman, it was torturous for my self esteem. I followed these people and compared myself physically to them and it was honestly killing me. It took up way more brain space than it should. And I think this is a problem a lot of women face with social media, especially instagram/tiktok. I have so many interests that fell to the wayside because I spent so much time scrolling through crap that made me feel awful. I'm now re-engaging with educational/informative things I used to love. I have more time to do these things. Congrats for taking that step \ud83d\udc4d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/neyegw/deleted_my_socials/gyjlec4/"}
