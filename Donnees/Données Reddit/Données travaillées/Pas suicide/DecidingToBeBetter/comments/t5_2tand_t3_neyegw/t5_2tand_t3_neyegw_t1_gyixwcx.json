I just took a similar step!  I haven\u2019t completely deleted my social media, but I took them off of my home screen yesterday so I can\u2019t easily access them (which is what sucks me in when bored).  I can\u2019t say I\u2019ll stay away for good, but I\u2019m just doing a week long detox and then afterwards going to severely moderate and change my social media habits/postings/followings, allowing myself only a few days out of the week and/or select hours a day I can access them.  Social media personally does some good as far as connection and information, but also quite the contrary as well.  I\u2019ll probably monthly do a weeklong detox too!  I\u2019m excited to see how this helps my short attention span, self esteem, relationships, and what I\u2019ve realized was an inflated ego.\n\nGood luck to you in your journey!! \ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/neyegw/deleted_my_socials/gyixwcx/"}
