Finding that balance would be amazing.\n\nFor me, I have found acknowledgement of the way we think of things is a good place to start, then recognising some of the styles of thinking such as catastrophising, black and white thinking (Google CBT thinking styles etc for a full list and explanations of what they are). When we recognise the different thinking styles that can effect us, we can start to challenge them and in turn creative a healthier more balanced mindset. I'm working on it as part of some bigger issues but it does help. \n\nOther than that I don't have suggestions, so I will be looking to see what other replies you get!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfqt69/how_can_i_be_positive_but_not_naive_and_realistic/hb67ldi/"}
