I founded a non-profit association with my friends, but I don't have much time for it. I volunteered at a food bank, went to India to work in a school, I tutor younger kids, help them with math, english and chemistry / biology. I proofread friends motivational letters and help them improve their CVs, because I'm good at that (got into most programmes / scholarships I applied for).\n\nI have a couple of friends that turn to me when they have personal / relationship issues...I think i'm a good listener, especially because I feel like shit myself...so I can empathise with them, but at the same time I can always find ways to help others, (just can't seem to help myself).\n\nAnd then I also turned around my boyfriend's life..like completely cleaned and organised his appartment, sorted his clothes, belongings, gave him tools to organise his mind and motivate him constantly to work on his career and get over his laziness and excuses ..\n\nI'm like this, I can always come up with a plan to sort out everyone's issues... I just can't seem to sort mine. I mean, I do all the steps, but they don't help lift up my mood...", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbwqmh/i_feel_like_absolute_crapive_done_a_ton_of_work/hhcop6n/"}
