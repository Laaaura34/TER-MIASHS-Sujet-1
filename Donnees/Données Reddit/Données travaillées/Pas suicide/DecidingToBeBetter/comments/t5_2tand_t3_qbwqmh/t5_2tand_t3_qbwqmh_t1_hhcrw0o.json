I feel like I have nothing to do. I know everyone, I've been to every bar and restaurant already. I don't like the food, I don't like the clothes.. I basically buy everything online, because I can't find anything I like here.\n\nI want to be free, I want to travel the world, work from home / have enough free time to be with my family and kids when I have them.\n\nI want to be able to mantain my lifestyle, and possibly improve it. I like the feeling of good fabrics and good skincare on my skin. It feels better. I like how good shoes feel on my feet.\n\nI'd like to have a nice view and enough space in my appartment. \n\nI was able to taste this way of life, and I want to be able to maintain it / for this to become my daily life, and not just an occasional luxury.\n\nI think I deserve it, and I think I'm able to get there, I just need to come up with a better plan. And I feel like it's not possible in my country. There are places where people earn 2x or 3x as much as me, for the same type of work.\n(Yeah living costs are higher there, but even if I substract living costs from their wages, they're still able to save / afford more than me)..", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbwqmh/i_feel_like_absolute_crapive_done_a_ton_of_work/hhcrw0o/"}
