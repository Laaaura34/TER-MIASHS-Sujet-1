There was also a lot of psychological work on myself in general that affected all the parts of my life. Plus, I changed to a healthier lifestyle with regular sports, 9h sleep and stuff like this. Still, I continued smoking because it was an automatic thing. Before I quit 20 days ago, I started asking myself \u201cDo I really want to smoke or I\u2019m just bored/anxious/want to go outside?\u201d so it helped me to understand my true motives. \nBut thank you for your concern once again! Now I have more things to be anxious about! :D", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh9zft/feeling_like_a_brand_new_human_now/hidwthg/"}
