Maybe a animal shelter, a homeless shelter. Check out low key, club type activities. Like bicycling on trails nearby. No talking needed. Anything that you find the least bit interesting. You will meet others, you will be getting out of you own head and out of your own way. No expectations. You will feel needed by the volunteering giving you something to look ahead to.  Potential friend development will also be something uplifting and a positive thing. None of this is dating but it puts you out in the world a little bit and could be a happier you in turn and a start toward a much happier life. I wish you the best !", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hg0kat8/"}
