Taking care of yourself is still important though. Making friends isn\u2019t going to fix your problems or help you solve them. I\u2019m honestly not sure what therapists you\u2019ve been attending to think they would just tell you to go make friends rather than continue seeking help for yourself. What happens when those friends are busy? Just wait around till they aren\u2019t? Relying on others for happiness is not going to keep you happy. Taking care of yourself, changing your mindset, putting in the effort to be better is going to make the difference", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfyzgdq/"}
