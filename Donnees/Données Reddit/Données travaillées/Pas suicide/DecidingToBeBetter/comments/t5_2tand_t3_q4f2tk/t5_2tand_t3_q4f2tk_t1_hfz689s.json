Friends are not going to solve your problems and if you\u2019re expecting that they will, I don\u2019t know if you know what a true friend is. A friend can sit with you and talk to you about your problems but is that going to solve them? Probably not. As I said before, having friends around can make life easier but they\u2019re not always going to be there. They have their own lives and their own well being that they\u2019re responsible for just like you. You and only you are responsible for yourself and whatever problem you may have. You can\u2019t expect others to always be around to help you, you have to be able to help yourself. Joy does not only come from others. It can come from many things. I\u2019m not really sure why you\u2019re bringing up hobbies seeing as they weren\u2019t part of this discussion but that\u2019s a great example of something that can bring you joy. A personal hobby of mine is painting. When I finish a painting, it brings me happiness and joy. If you don\u2019t understand that, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re missing out. I hope you can have an open enough mind to understand where I\u2019m coming from, thank you for your input.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfz689s/"}
