It's a music festival. Spend the months between now and June researching and preparing for it. It will give you a sense of purpose and adventure. Don't be afraid to go alone. A lot of us roll solo and there are specific campgrounds for those who do.\n\nIt will throw you just far enough outside your comfort zone to still be safe but also radically different from anything you've ever done before. The community there is like nothing I've experienced. No judgment, no hate, just thousands of people coming together to be free for four long days in June. \n\nDo it. It will change you in multiple ways, all of them good.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hg0jike/"}
