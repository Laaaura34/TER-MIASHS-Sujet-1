I cancelled my sub 2 weeks ago and I don't know where to even start. I have a few friends that I go out drinking with every now and then but I have 0 social skills, I've never taken any risks outside of gaming.. I haven't done anything with my life so far, I failed school, I somehow managed to get a full time job though. But this made me think differently..\n\nAnd I honestly hope you can start seeing the positive in this, you live and you learn if I we're in your shoes I would try to start taking risks with women atleast to somewhat get in a relationship and when that ball starts rolling im sure you'll start to enjoy life more. We're all going to make it man, just keep going.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfzyp7d/"}
