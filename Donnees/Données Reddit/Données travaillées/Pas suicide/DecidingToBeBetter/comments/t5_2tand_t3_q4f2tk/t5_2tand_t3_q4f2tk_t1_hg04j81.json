It's like my 20s was the training period and my teens years were the learning period. So I feel like finally I can start living my life! You have a stable job so you have money to spend on yourself and meet people. That's good! I was saving money for myself and didn't feel comfortable spending money until I had more income and experience. I would recommend spending less time on social media because it's full of incomplete stories about people's lives. I think therapy or journaling can get you figure out what you want out of life if you feel like you wasted your 20s. Get out there and start doing things. Spent time on hobbies and make friends. Ask them to spend time with you. It's hard to make friends in your late 20s and 30s since many people are busy. But there is no way you're the only one with this problem.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hg04j81/"}
