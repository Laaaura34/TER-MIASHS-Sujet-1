Okay, not having done much in your 20s sucks, but you're going to write off the next 40+ years because of that? You're upset you sleepwalked through the last ten years and so want to do that several times over?\n\nJust do all the Shit you wish you did. Live what you think is a meaningful life. No one is timing you or your life achievements. People love and live and experience things and find hobbies all throughout their lives, till death. \n\nI'd also recommend getting some therapy - I too struggled with being unable to do things because I was so distraught about not doing it earlier. Not like this, in a more micro level , but I do think it'll help you and help you contextualise Ur 20s", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hg1qkth/"}
