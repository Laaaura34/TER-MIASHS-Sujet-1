Im 30 and only have one close friend. Single (granted after a year long relationship. My only one ever) and have no children.\n\nMy hobby? Nothing. I play video games. I bartend for a living. Granted, I love my job. But two years prior to this I spent over five years working as an engineer and *hated* it. At 28 I considered suicide.\n\nIm 30 now. And in less than two years, I decided against killing myself, and literally everything got better. I started a business, I learned new skills, and I met the love of my life.\n\nThan a pandemic happened. The love of my life turned into my worst nightmare, and I gave up my business and went to bartending full time. I still cry over my ex but I don\u2019t miss the business. However, I love what I do for work with a passion.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is, don\u2019t blanket statement your life. Some things might need work, sure. But you\u2019re not a failure.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfzckv1/"}
