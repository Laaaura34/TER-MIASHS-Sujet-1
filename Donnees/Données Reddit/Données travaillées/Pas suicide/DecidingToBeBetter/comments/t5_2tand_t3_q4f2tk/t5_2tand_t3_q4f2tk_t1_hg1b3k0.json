Less so maybe, but the risk never goes away. I have heard about people transitioning gender in their 50\u2019s or older! There is a reason late 20\u2019s is the most common age range to get married. It\u2019s when most people are *relatively* settled, have careers and are more financially stable. \n\nFor women fertility declines in the mid to late 30\u2019s and risks of pregnancy increase, so for a woman who wants multiple kids it definitely makes sense not to wait past 30 to get married if she feels ready before that. Research suggests the best outcomes of marriage are associated with marrying your late 20\u2019s and early 30\u2019s, although it obviously depends on the individual and OP definitely still has plenty of time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hg1b3k0/"}
