In fact, it's pretty unique, and should be considered special.\n\nPersonally, what most of my 20's presented was violence, heartbreak, drug use, parties, debt, and poor decisions.\n\nIt wasn't until my late 20's that I found love, had kids, got a career, and settled into a pleasant life. Which, honestly, I'm one of the only people in my group of friends that's gotten there already. Late 20's is YOUNG, my friend. \n\nI'm proud of you for avoiding the unpleasant, miserable 20's that a lot of people put themselves through. Don't take it for granted. You've escaped a lot by having a \"boring\" experience thus far. I think you're special for that.\n\nAs far as the things you say you've missed out on? That's all still on the table. You're not even 30, my dude! You have a lifetime ahead of you to gain the traction you seek. Keep your head up. A lot of people gathered the life they love in their 30's, 40's, 50's. \n\nYours is still in reach. I have no doubt about it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfz58xf/"}
