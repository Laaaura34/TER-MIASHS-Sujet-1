It's never too late to start. Try to find some sort of community...be it a church, gym, volunteer group, book club. etc. Try to engage a passion. Take a class. Travel. If you put yourself out there a bit and follow your interest,s you will find connection. Also, I would suggest volunteering in some way. Getting out of your own head and helping others will help YOU. Lastly, have you tried talking to a counselor? Even a couple of sessions might help.
