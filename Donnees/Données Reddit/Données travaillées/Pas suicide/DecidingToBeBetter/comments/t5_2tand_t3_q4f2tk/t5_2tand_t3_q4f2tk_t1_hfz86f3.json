I also am a musician. Friends help you gain perspective that you can't get when you're spinning wheels in your own head. They also provide advice and expertise (about practical/career things). Never said that they are the only thing that will solve a problem. Just that they help. I'm honestly not sure how you can deny that friends help solve problems, in addition to providing emotional support and fun.\n\nEdit: And you're projecting wayyy too much into the situation and assuming that someone looking for friends is going to be needy and overly demanding of others' time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfz86f3/"}
