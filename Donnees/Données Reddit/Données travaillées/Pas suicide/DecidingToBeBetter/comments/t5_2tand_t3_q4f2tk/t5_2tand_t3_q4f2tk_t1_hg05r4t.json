Enjoy it! You still have plenty of time to experience ALL of the things that you've mentioned. \nThere is a time for everything, stop comparing your journey to that of others. They had different circumstances in their life, but not necessarily better or worse. \nMaybe you need a little drama to fully grasp the coolness of your life. You need some challenges for your bored mind. \nDo everything fully, with all your consciousness not walk-sleeped. If you do things with passion you will find passion within yourself. \nStop trying to be cool or ahead. You are cool already. Don't stress yourself and don't take life too seriously.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hg05r4t/"}
