I did basically the same in my 20\u2019s.  Partied and drank a lot and then me and my friends just all went in different directions and I ended up just by myself.  I worked and hung out in my apartment by myself.  I didn\u2019t date, I didn\u2019t go out.  I went to my job that I hated and wasted a lot of years.  I finally just quit my job.  I moved.  I online dated.  11 years later I am married, I have a child, I own my 2nd home which is my dream home.  Things can change.  You just have to change them and you have LOTS of time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hg1lo0g/"}
