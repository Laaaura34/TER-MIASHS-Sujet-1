But this dude puts out a book damn near every other month. He explained his technique once, and said that the key is to convince himself that he is not writing. \nHe tells himself \"this isn't my book, I am just taking down some notes, I will probably not use this\" and it takes the pressure off. Then once he gets all the ideas out, he can start revising that until he has a final draft. So by the end, he never actually sat down to write the book, he just took notes and revised.\n\nDon't write the book, just take notes for 10 minutes a day. You'll get there soon enough!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ha8y3l/im_so_fucking_lazy_i_wasted_this_whole_quarantine/fv22uru/"}
