I set it up, I do my first twenty five minutes and then I take my five minute break, it helps me get into a flow state without all the effort.  There's an app you can download, just try one out, do a single block of twenty five minutes and see how it travels.\n\nBest of luck, and don't forget to love yourself, life is hard enough without being in your own corner.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ha8y3l/im_so_fucking_lazy_i_wasted_this_whole_quarantine/fv1jh8m/"}
