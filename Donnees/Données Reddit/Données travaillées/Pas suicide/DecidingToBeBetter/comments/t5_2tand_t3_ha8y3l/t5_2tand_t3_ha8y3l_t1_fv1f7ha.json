Tomorrow is a new day. take the way you feel right now and let it motivate you to sit your butt down at that computer and just start writing. we are human and your gonna make mistakes. sooo many people wasted away their time in quarantine and I know because Im one of those people lol and now Im kicking myself because Im back to work and I didn't get anything that I wanted to do done. Im not saying don't feel bad Im just saying don't let the way you feel stop you from having a better day tomorrow. if it helps start off small. set a timer on your phone and only write until that timer is up. and increase the time everyday if you can. before you realize it your book will be finished. cut your self a little slack. you can do this. I believe in you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ha8y3l/im_so_fucking_lazy_i_wasted_this_whole_quarantine/fv1f7ha/"}
