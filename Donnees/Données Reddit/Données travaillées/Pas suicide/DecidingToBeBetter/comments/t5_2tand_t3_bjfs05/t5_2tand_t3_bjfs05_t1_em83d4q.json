To a country that doesnt speak English and has a confusing metro system. I know the trip is a self love thing but it was a struggle to really convince myself that this was a good idea.\n\nThe key for me is reminding myself why I'm doing the trip. I managed to figure out that I'm not planning the perfect trip. I'm planning a trip for my mental health. So what I did with my itinerary is set one goal for where to go on each day and I'm planning on winging the rest with phone and data. Restaurants for example are easy since you can search it on google maps and it automatically shows you the ratings and distances of restaurants near you. So I'm not researching any of that unless theres something specific I want to eat.\n\nI love art so I'm planning on one museum per day and then I'll make like a traveler and just figure out the rest of my day from there. I'm bringing my sketchbook and my kindle- stuff that help me find solitude (being at peace with my being alone). Fortunately the time difference between my location and where I'm from is only off by an hour and my friends have offered to be on standby if I'm stumped with what to do. I can just chat them up if I have questions. The internet is magic!\n\nSo dont feel pressured to hit all the best spots. Pick the spots that you know will matter to you. Or dont even hit the best spots and just find some place to get a massage or go hiking.... stuff that helps you relax. It's a vacation, so hope you get to enjoy yourself!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bjfs05/im_going_on_a_trip_planning_it_is_the_hardest/em83d4q/"}
