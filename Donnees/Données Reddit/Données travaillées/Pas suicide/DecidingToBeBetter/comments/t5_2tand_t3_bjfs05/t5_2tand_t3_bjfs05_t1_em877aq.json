Know you can't go then).\n\nHave a rough draft of what you want to do which days. \n\nOnce you are there, figure out if you need to move your schedule around based on weather or last minute changes like a new event popping up.\n\nBe flexible and build in time that isn't planned. If you plan a museum for the morning and then decide that you want to stay all day, do that instead of sticking to your afternoon schedule. Also, know that the afternoon plan that you are changing can happen another day so you won't miss the really cool thing that only happens that afternoon.\n\nLearn that if you miss something, it gives you a reason to go back. We tried to squeeze in the Sisteen Chapel after the line was too long in the morning. We ran back in the afternoon and still couldn't see it. Oh well, guess that is for my next trip to Italy. Also, my life is not forever ruined because I missed it.\n\nAlso, planning a trip is stressful and frustrating. I've done it so many times and still enjoy it regardless.
