It doesn't take a rocket scientist to tell you that industry isn't for everyone.  But the important thing is you made a decision you felt is best for yourself and for others and anytime you can do that, is a win in any book.\n\nYou've said some awesome things and it sounds like you've got your head in the right place.  Your understanding of time as a valuable, finite resource is spot on.  Not many people come to that realization.\n\nThis is also a prime example of how we should be making decisions in life.  Seeing the cards we have available and the best possible hands we can play.  You weren't enjoying your craft, your self-respect was diminishing, libido down, relationship with your partner at a low, subscribers spending on you rather than their own sustenance, the constant need to push beyond your boundaries, and many more are all reasons why this isn't working for you.  And it all greatly outweighs the pros of it (certainly doing it for a minimum wage makes it worse).\n\nI'm glad you're taking a stand and hopefully, many others who are in a similar situation can find you for respite and community.\n\nWhere will you go now or do?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1z4zo/i_quit_onlyfans_because_it_was_harming_me_my/hfhwf72/"}
