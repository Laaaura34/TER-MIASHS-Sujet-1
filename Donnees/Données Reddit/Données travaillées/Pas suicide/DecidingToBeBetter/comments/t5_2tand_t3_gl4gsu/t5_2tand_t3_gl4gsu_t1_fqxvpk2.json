Also describing where you feel itout loud helps. Example: \u201ci feel jealousy in my chest and in my breathing because this....\u201d and well that is something that helps me a lot and have made me with being more happy with myself and others :D and also the fact that you want to be better is amazing so that gives you a bonus at trying to take away those things that aren\u2019t healthy for yourself", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gl4gsu/i_need_some_other_way_to_deal_with_jealousy_and/fqxvpk2/"}
