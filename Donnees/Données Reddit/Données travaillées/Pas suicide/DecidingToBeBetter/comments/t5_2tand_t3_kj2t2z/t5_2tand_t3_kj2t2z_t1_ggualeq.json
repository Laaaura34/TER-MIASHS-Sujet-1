I\u2019ve been trying to change my patterns for years. I\u2019ve just decided to keep trying the things that I really want to get right. They say it takes 30 days to develop a new habit, but it\u2019s not true when your habit has been happening for years. And it depends on age too. I recently learnt about a guy who used to ride his bike regularly, decided to learn how to ride his bike with the handlebars backwards. (So steering was also backwards) it took him 8 months to stop falling off and successfully ride a short distance. His younger son learnt it in 2 weeks. \n\nFind one thing that you want to change. For example, having a healthy lunch, and make it something that you HAVE to do. Make it really easy though, have 1 healthy lunch once a week. Make it the same day of the week, Tuesday is best if you work Mon-Fri, as then a public holiday Monday isn\u2019t going to mess you up. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve done this comfortably for a few months, make it 2 healthy lunches a week. Etc etc. Start really really small. My husband told me (when I was stressing about my huge to do list) \u201cstart with the small, cause the big things are just lots of little things.\u201d Which is true and I knew this too, but I just needed a reminder. \n\nMy small thing is to exercise for approx 10 minutes twice a week. Which is a lot for me and my time, but I\u2019m going to keep trying. I\u2019m stubborn.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kj2t2z/cant_stand_the_constant_balancing_act/ggualeq/"}
