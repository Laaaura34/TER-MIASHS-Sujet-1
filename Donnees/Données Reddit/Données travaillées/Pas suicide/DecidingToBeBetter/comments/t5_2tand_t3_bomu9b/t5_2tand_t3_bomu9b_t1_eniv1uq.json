Nothing seems to be going right, any little thing that can go wrong will, I personally just don\u2019t feel \u201csettled\u201d like I usually do.  I\u2019m an alcoholic myself and spent the better part of the day at work telling myself that I was buying beer when I got off of work and getting blackout drunk.  It would be the first time in awhile.  Instead, I somehow managed to get my car headed home with no beer instead of actually stopping and getting the beer.  So I\u2019m sitting here  at home slowly losing that urge to drink but still feeling frustrated with every little thing that seems to be going wrong right now and I happened across your post.  Thank you for sharing.  Your post has had a positive impact on me.  If you can throw away the coke and feel good about it then I can feel good about not picking up the beer.  Thanks friend and I wish you the best in the future.  Your strength helped a sap like me out today.  Much obliged.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bomu9b/72_days_clean_found_some_coke/eniv1uq/"}
