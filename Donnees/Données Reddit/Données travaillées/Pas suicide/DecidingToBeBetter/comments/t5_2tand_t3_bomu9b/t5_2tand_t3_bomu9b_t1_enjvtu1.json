It looked like someone had literally spit it out. In one motion I picked it up and took it like it was the most logical thing in the world and it was the start of a week long stupor that left me broke and it's a small miracle I didn't manage to o.d. since I jumped back in to my \"normal\" using dosages right away. I was lucky enough to get clean again and I have 2 years in 11 days. What you did was very impressive and I'm proud of you and you should be proud of yourself it's a big deal!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bomu9b/72_days_clean_found_some_coke/enjvtu1/"}
