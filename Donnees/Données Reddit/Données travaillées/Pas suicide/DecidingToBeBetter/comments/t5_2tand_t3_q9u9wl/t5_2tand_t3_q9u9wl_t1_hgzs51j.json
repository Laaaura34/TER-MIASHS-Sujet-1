University is nothing like high school, so your grades will change and thats normal. Start to watch youtube cooking toturials, that saved me a lot of meals lol.

Good luck on it all and i hope you get to be where/what you dream of!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9u9wl/realization_the_start_of_a_journey/hgzs51j/"}
