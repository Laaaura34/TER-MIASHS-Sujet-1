Look at one of your bad habits and imagine a better habit you want to replace it with. Then try it out once in practice.\n\nOld habits are as strong as they are because you have been feeding them for years, and new habits are small, starving little things that you need to feed so they one day can be bigger than your old ones. Unfortunatley the old ones might be strong enough to bully you into still feeding them but all change starts small.\n\nAnd ofc dont try to change all your habits at once, you are likely to drop one on the floor and step on it instead.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pck101/how_to_unlearn_a_bad_habit/halnn2p/"}
