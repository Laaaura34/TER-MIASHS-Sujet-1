The key to breaking both of these habits are patience. You need to be in it for the long con.\n\nOkay. I used to have a serious binge eating problem as well and this is what helped me:\n\n1. I can't remember where I saw it but I ate whatever I wanted and however much I wanted completely unrestricted and guilt free every 3-4 hours for about 2-3 weeks, so do that even if it means binging every meal.\n\n2. Then I no longer had as strong of a desire to binge so I made an active effort to eat whatever I wanted untiI was *full* every three to four hours, not about to throw up. There is no scientific measurement for when you feel full but by this point you would definitely know the difference between satisfied and about to throw up.\n\nThat was it.\n\nIf this doesn't work for you could just google \"how I stopped binge eating\" and try out their different methods.\n\n\nAs for procrastination I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveDysfunction/comments/paih3q/how_i_tackle_ed_and_stay_productive_every_day/) about how I tackle procrastination despite (probably) suffering from executive dysfunction (which is basically the inability to be productive), so if it helps someone with that disorder it would help someone that's neurotypical. If this doesn't work for you browse r/getdisciplined's wiki and top of all time to figure out what works for you.\n\nHope this helped!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pck101/how_to_unlearn_a_bad_habit/hajgris/"}
