I don't do it anymore in a structured way, but I do keep up a journal still and it's almost entirely full of awesome stuff that I like, instead of stuff I'm dreading or anxious about - so I guess the process is still paying off!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a7vwkv/sticking_to_even_the_tiniest_routine_can_do/ec7dgf6/"}
