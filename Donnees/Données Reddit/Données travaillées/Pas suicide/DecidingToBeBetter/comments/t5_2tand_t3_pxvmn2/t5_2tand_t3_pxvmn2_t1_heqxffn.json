Modern versions of this practice often include this mantra of self responsibility:  \n\n\"I love you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you.\"  \n\nI like to say this mantra when I recognize that I am holding a person or situation in judgement.  The part of me that recognizes the fault of another can only do so because I recognize those same characteristics in myself.  Taking responsibility gives me power to change how I feel about the situation.  External reality thus has no power over my emotional state, which has a disproportionate affect on my happiness.\n\nI believe that you have it in yourself to experience the same thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxvmn2/advice_on_self_forgiveness/heqxffn/"}
