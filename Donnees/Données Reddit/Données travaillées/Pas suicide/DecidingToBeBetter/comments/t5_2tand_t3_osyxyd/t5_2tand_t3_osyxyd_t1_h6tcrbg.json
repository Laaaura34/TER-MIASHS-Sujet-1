Results: It took me a week or so from distance to convince him after 18 years it was over and why. I couldn't stay in it one minute longer. It was very hard to do over the phone. I walked him through my own hurt, why it wasn't working, and why I was giving up. That was in 2019.\n\nToday. I'm happily married to a childhood sweetheart I reconnected with and living my best life EVER. \n\nI chose to break off the old relationship with kindness and for the same reason you did: closure. It was the first time I decided to do it this way. My heart was torqued so many times in my life, I never want to hurt anyone the way I was hurt, or hurt past relationships like that again.\n\nGood luck. You are doing the right thing, as hard as it may be. And I hope for you the right one comes along and you find the happiness that I found.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osyxyd/i_had_to_break_a_heart_but_i_did_it_like_no_one/h6tcrbg/"}
