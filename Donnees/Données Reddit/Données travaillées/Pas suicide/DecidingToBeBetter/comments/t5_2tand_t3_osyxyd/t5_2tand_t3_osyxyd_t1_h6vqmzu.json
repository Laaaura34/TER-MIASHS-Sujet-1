It's especially difficult when it comes to having to end a relationship with someone you really don't want to be hurt. I think the uncomfortably of actually breaking up is a big reason why a lot of people wait so long to finally do it. I understand it's uncomfortable to do, but I wish more people would consider just how much more pain they're inflicting onto their SO by dragging it out for so long. By the time the breakup conversation actually does happen, it's easy to identify the past weeks, months, even years that they were just pretending and that they stopped being as crazy for you as you stayed for them some time ago.\n\nI think you handled this in the best way you could. I know it's hard ripping that bandaid off, so I'm glad you made the choices you did to try to make it as painless as you possible for your ex-partner.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osyxyd/i_had_to_break_a_heart_but_i_did_it_like_no_one/h6vqmzu/"}
