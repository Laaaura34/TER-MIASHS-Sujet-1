I am very young (under 18) and although I think dating before you are at least 16 is pointless, I have a friend who doesn\u2019t think that way. Recently she got really close with a guy (even though she really hadn\u2019t known him for that long) and it was to the point where they both said they liked each other, and would have started dating but he wanted to ask her out in person. I was able to meet him once over FaceTime and he seemed like a really nice, good, stand up kid. Unfortunately before he could ask her out, he lost feelings for her. But instead of just dumping her over text (even though they weren\u2019t actually dating) he called her over FaceTime and told her face to face, and was really kind and upfront about it. Obviously it was nowhere near a serious relationship, and even though she was really upset about it, I was actually thankful and it almost made me like him more. People like you, and, said boy are good people. You did the right thing, and in the end you will be glad you did, even if it is hard right now. Thank you for doing what you did. Even though I don\u2019t know you, I appreciate it. It\u2019s nice to know that there are people like you out there. I wish you the best of luck. ~ A random stranger on the internet", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osyxyd/i_had_to_break_a_heart_but_i_did_it_like_no_one/h6sr9mg/"}
