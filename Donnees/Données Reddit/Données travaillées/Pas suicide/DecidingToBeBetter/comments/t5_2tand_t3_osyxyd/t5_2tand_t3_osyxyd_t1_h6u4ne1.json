It's important and I'm glad you handled it that way.\n\nIt's funny, often on Reddit (at least on the /r/relationships section, which is already a messed up place) they often show no sympathy during breakups, suggest just ripping off the bandaid (like you did) but don't seem to think you owe anyone a good respectful breakup. no one's eever said to ghost but the general tone there is to hinting to just disappear afterwards. i'm glad you didn't take that route.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osyxyd/i_had_to_break_a_heart_but_i_did_it_like_no_one/h6u4ne1/"}
