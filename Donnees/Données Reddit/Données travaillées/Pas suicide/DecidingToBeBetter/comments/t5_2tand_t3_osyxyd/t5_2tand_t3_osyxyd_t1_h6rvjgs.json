Can\u2019t tell you how many times I wish I was able to leave relationships unscathed. I have some emotional baggage from previous relationships which is no fun. But advice I have is relationships hinges upon <{[COMMUNICATION]} and how both parties truthfully input and react. Its a negotiation but a chance for you to advocate for your needs wants desires and goals. I respect your cautious attempt to break off and hopefully stay friends in the end if thats in the picture. Best of luck to you", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osyxyd/i_had_to_break_a_heart_but_i_did_it_like_no_one/h6rvjgs/"}
