I think I was a bit harsh and reactive. I just get annoyed coz I read books all the time multiple times, and then there's some people who watch heaps of tv and chuckle and say \"ah I don't have time for books\" or \"I'm not much of a reader\" those people piss me off because I feel like they're just making excuses and this person on reddit reminded me of them. I apologise though for reacting. I do lack some empathy when it comes to other peoples capabilities.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cc5g9e/grant_cardone_ten_steps_to_be_a_millionaire/etldad8/"}
