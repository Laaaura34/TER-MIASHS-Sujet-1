They\u2019re 27 and live with parents, but instead of saving money each month, they (somehow?) got into credit card debt and now can\u2019t find a place they can afford to live so they hop from family member to family member. I suggested side hustles to her and she cried \u201cI dont have TIME!!!\u201d When all she has is a full time job, no kids, nothing else. Just wants to go be social instead. I couldn\u2019t take her serious because my social life is usually the first thing to take a hit when I need $$. Do I want to do doordash and shit all the time or hustle all the time? No not really lol. I\u2019d love to kick back too. But I have to work hard to get through my period of life right now as I have these buildings, I\u2019m getting my RE license, and can\u2019t have a job with set hours right now as I have to work with these properties and it\u2019s unpredictable. I just don\u2019t understand people who think having an easy, average work ethic is going to get them an amazing life. She thinks she\u2019s going to find a millionaire to take care of her still. Honey, you\u2019re 27 and make no attempt to fulfill this dream. It aint happening. Like anything else, that goal requires steps to reach it (looking great, being intelligent, spending time where millionaires spend time, engaging with them, keeping up on $$ news and networking events which she does not do) Lol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cc5g9e/grant_cardone_ten_steps_to_be_a_millionaire/etlqffw/"}
