Turned it from a straight up meth trap spot to a 100% occupied, clean, quiet residency for my tenants in 6 months BY MYSELF after going through hell with a property management company. Filing evictions myself. Cleaning out and hauling to the dump myself. Dealing with all the deferred maintenance. I do all of this unpaid work also while going for my real estate license, finding time to make money for my own bills, (I do deliveries and phone work for now til I can get better situated in my Real Estate career), keeping close with friends and family, keeping my own home and self clean and upkept. My days start at 6AM in the gym and often don\u2019t end til 10PM-11PM. I don\u2019t stop til my tasks are finished. Not when I\u2019m tired. \n\nI read extremely fast and pick up concepts quickly. Usually read during my workouts or when I\u2019m waiting for my handymen. \n\nI found the 10X rule so repetitive I couldn\u2019t get through it. I read about 3 books a month (Last 3, Rachel and Her Children, Time Warped, and Troublemaker by Leah Remini. Don\u2019t judge me haha) but I\u2019m not going to waste my time forcing something I don\u2019t find engaging. As you\u2019ve said, many of my books are highlighted, written in, and notated. There are tons of other books that have similar information that are much less repetitive. My brain doesn\u2019t need 10 examples of a concept to understand it. Another book I found repetitive was \u201cYour Brain On Nature.\u201d Great book with a lot of great points, but crazy repetitive. \n\nHow is me appreciating a summary of his books a bad thing? I often find shortcuts in my day and I think that is part of success. Thank you OP for going through the task of reading this repetitive book and condensing it for people who\u2019s minds work on a quicker level like mine.  And to the commenter, you made a lot of assumptions about someone who doesn\u2019t want to read a boring book. \n\nSide note: am female.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cc5g9e/grant_cardone_ten_steps_to_be_a_millionaire/etloamw/"}
