Developing a plan of actionable steps helps me. There is motivation in knowing that with so much bad going on we can go out and make it better, even with little gestures and efforts. \n\nI always remember the Oscar Wilde quote that I love from his play An Ideal Husband: \"It takes a great deal of courage to see the world in all its tainted glory and still to love it.\" It gets me to refocus on good I can be doing and catalyzes my action.\n\nI guess the first question is are you in therapy? Having a professional to help navigate your journey with more objectivity is a game changer. This helps but you have to be patient enough to find the right therapist. It's a working relationship so you have to know you'll get what you need from them. \n\nNext, what makes you happy? Carving out time to do something every day helps. Can you go for a walk? Read with a cup of tea? Watch a silly show? What's a small thing you can do now, every day, to start helping yourself? Your needs and happiness matter, and it's only when your cup is full that you can pour it out for other people.\n\nI'm so sorry about your sister.
