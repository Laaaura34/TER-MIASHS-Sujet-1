Sometimes I sit and look at my husband and start to get choked up. All the years I wasted being a selfish, narcissistic asshole. All the times and ways I hurt him. I think back to the stupid things I said and did you him and just can't believe I did that. It's been a year of a completely new life. He is waiting for the other shoe to drop and I don't blame him. All I can do is keeping proving my love and dedication to him each day. Don't give up! Just keep getting better each day and don't give in even if she doesn't give you a second chance. It may take her time to see consistent change in you. If nothing else, write her a letter expressing your feelings and ask her forgiveness. Don't ask to get back together. Just ask for forgiveness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khvnto/i_was_an_objectifying_manipulative_person_i/ggqvn6j/"}
