I had this good friend who was a little bit like you. When he had a gf after some time he would talk bad about her, lie or even cheat and I never understood why. After 6 years of friendship we somehow started something romantic. The thing is, he also had something going on with another girl and I asked him about it. He lied and manipulated me just to get me laid. After 6 years of being \"best friends\" that hurted so much I ended the friendship. \n\nThis happend 4 years ago and I never heard of him since then. Suddently a few weeks ago he just texted me that he still feels very sorry about it and he is seeing a therapist now. I never expected that. I always thought he's just an ashole and didn't care about me at all, but now I think he just had his own issues, he just wasn't able to have an honest relationship.   \nThe friendship is over, but I wish him the best. \n\nI hope you can become the person you want to be, keep working on yourself. An honest and respectful relationship is totally worth it!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khvnto/i_was_an_objectifying_manipulative_person_i/ggobs9k/"}
