It\u2019s all about self improvement. Pick up new hobbies, workout, meditate, get away from everybody if you have to. \n\nOnce you are content with yourself, there\u2019s 2 paths people take. Either they brag and are condescending about how put together they are, or they strive to help others. The latter is the endgame of likability. \n\nThis is for several reasons. If you are happy alone, you begin to build a stronger sense of self and individuality. You start to have quirks, hobbies, and interests that are outside of the social setting. These are the pillars we build our first impressions on. On top of this, you are also less reliant on others so you never come off as annoying or needy. If you strive to help others, and follow basic social rules, you\u2019ll come off as confident in yourself and nice. \n\nEven if you\u2019re a shy person, someone confident in their personality who is also open and nice to others will always attract others.\n\nTLDR: The first step to become better socially is to improve yourself, completely separate from your social ties.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khi92q/i_want_to_be_better_i_am_a_toxic_person/ggo4x9m/"}
