It's very difficult to spot this because toxic adults are very good at manipulating children into thinking they are good people. Everyone thinks their childhood was more normal than it really was, so take a very close look at the behaviors of people in your life and try to be honest with yourself about their flaws without judging them too harshly for them. \n\nAs for yourself, I think the best thing to do is to start with \"the four agreements\". A lot of advice on how to be a better person can be boiled down to those 4. \n\n1. Be impeccable with your word\n\n2. Don't take anything personally\n\n3. Don't make assumptions\n\n4. Always do your best \n\nYou can get more complicated than that, but I think it's a good place to start if you want to be a less toxic person.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khi92q/i_want_to_be_better_i_am_a_toxic_person/ggmkas8/"}
