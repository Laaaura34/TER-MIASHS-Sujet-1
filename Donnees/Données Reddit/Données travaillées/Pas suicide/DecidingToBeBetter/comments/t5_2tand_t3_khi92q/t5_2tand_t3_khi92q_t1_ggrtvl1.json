When he was young my dad got beaten up while his friend was held at knife point, and my dad was told that if he resisted the friend would have his throat cut. \nAnd my mom\u2019s younger and only brother (my uncle) became an alcoholic who couldn\u2019t take care of himself and while my mom tried to help him, he never improved and kept drinking and eventually she had to cut ties with him because of how toxic he was to her. \n\nBoth my parents went through many traumatic experiences growing up, so I definitely have some sympathy for them and how they acted around me because they both come from messed up families too.\n\nI\u2019ll still check out the stuff you recommended though, thanks for the suggestion.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khi92q/i_want_to_be_better_i_am_a_toxic_person/ggrtvl1/"}
