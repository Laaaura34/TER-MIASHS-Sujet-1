I'm not sure I was even fully sapient/concious by 14, like I was such a little kid until mid high school that I was basically in my own world. Too blissfully ignorant to even come up with suicide as an option.\n\nI guess it keeps getting tougher out there.. I tell people all the time that we need better schools and free mental healthcare for everybody. It makes me so frustrated to hear about good kids struggling. Please talk to people when you need help, even if it's just to an online community. I believe you can keep doing better and better and maybe you'll help inspire others one day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mln9m7/after_getting_out_of_the_psych_ward_im_doing_a/gtncpwp/"}
