It feels like taking care of a pet, but with much, much less responsibility.\n\nAs a starter, no need to do it super correctly. Just buy some seeds, spray them with water everyday, and that's it. It can be done in a yard (outdoor) or indoor.\n\nI find gardening really helps with my mental health. It makes me feel like I'm doing something for the greater good (like, even though my contribution is tiny, I help make the earth greener ... Or so I thought). Bonus point if whatever I planted grows up to be thriving and healthy. Makes me feel successful, and really boost my self esteem.\n\nBy the way, r/creepyencounters is fun. My first encounter with reddit is with its sister (?) sub, r/letsnotmeet. Go check it out. Reading the sub is also a fun hobby.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qf9mbl/hobby_suggestions/hhynlpz/"}
