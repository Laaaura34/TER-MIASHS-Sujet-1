The process should involve getting you to think in ways about problems and issues that you had not considered outside of therapy.\n\nIf you are looking for a therapist to tell you what to do or offer solutions to your problems, that would not be good therapy.\n\nThe thing works by breaking down your perspective and helping you to see outside of it in new ways. Once you see things differently you will be on a better position to do things differently\n\nThere are variables that weigh in to determine effectiveness, but to keep this post short, I will for point some of them\n\n- the relationship with the therapist. You need someone that's a good match for you\n- the modality or frameworj of the therapist. There are many different models. Some are better for some things than others\n- how far down the track you are in your own self development, and how open you are to new ideas and change\n- how clear you are on what you want to focus on and bring to the sessions\n\nBasically of you are engaged and present, and the therapist is skilled, the rest should happen organically", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dmr9zc/can_anyone_here_explain_the_stepsprocess_of_how/f54py17/"}
