You feel like if you did therapy, the result would be you would be less likeable?\n\nSorry if I was unclear. I don't think it would make me less likable, but I'm afraid that it wouldn't make me any more likable. That I would still be as likable as I am right now, which isn't very. My fear is that the underlying problem of me not being likable wouldn't be dealt with, and I would just be left feeling comfortable with my unlikable self. And I don't want to be comfortable with something bad like that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dmr9zc/can_anyone_here_explain_the_stepsprocess_of_how/f57rmni/"}
