Other people have observed the same thing. If that doesn't work, then what would count as sufficient evidence? I'm sure I have it. You know there's a 50% chance I have below average intelligence, not even counting what I've observed. And a 10% chance that I'm among the world's stupidest 10%. That's something like 750 million people. What are the chances that these mental health issues are at fault and that all the evidence is just in my, and other people's, heads? A *lot* lower, I'd say.\n\nI know this is a thing people do on the internet. No one can just be stupid, it's gotta be something else, ignoring the very large number of people out there who *are* actually stupid. But ignoring it doesn't make it go away. I thank you for attempting to help and for putting in the effort to discuss this with me but I'm not one of the cases you've identified me as. I know with near-certainty (obviously nothing's 100%, but I'm about as certain as I can be) that I have this issue and I just want a way to fix it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppqbm3/is_there_any_way_to_increase_intelligence/hd6eek3/"}
