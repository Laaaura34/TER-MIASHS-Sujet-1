It\u2019s damn impressive. \n\nThat being said though it seems you really desire the cheap way out of this, and frankly nothing like that exists. While natural intelligence does exist, it is extremely self-centered to say that you are stuck being dumber than the rest. And don\u2019t think for a second that so called \u201cprodigies\u201d don\u2019t work their asses off to get to where they are. \n\nCold hard truth is that if you want to be smarter you\u2019ll have to work for it. If you have never stood up how can you expect to walk and run, if you have never solved a math problem how can you expect to be great at algebra or calculus, if you have never solved a n everyday problem how can you expect to know exactly what to do. \n\nEverybody would fail unless they have experienced it before. Experience and practice is everything. So nurture yourself to be able to solve what you want to solve. There\u2019s no omnipotence answer you want and there never will be. Do what interests you and I can guarantee one day somebody else will be impressed by your knowledge. You\u2019ve already impressed me so don\u2019t hold yourself back.
