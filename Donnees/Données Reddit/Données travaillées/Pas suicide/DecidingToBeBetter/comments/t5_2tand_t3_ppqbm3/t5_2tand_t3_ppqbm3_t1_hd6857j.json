Intelligence seems to be biologically grounded and something you're born with that is consistent across your lifetime. Practising tasks will you make you better at those kind of tasks, but the skill isn't generalised to other domains. For example IQ is correlated with tetris ability, but practising tetris won't raise your IQ. On the other hand, maintaining your IQ seems to be only possible through exercise. Also being well read and educated is possible without raising fluid intelligence.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppqbm3/is_there_any_way_to_increase_intelligence/hd6857j/"}
