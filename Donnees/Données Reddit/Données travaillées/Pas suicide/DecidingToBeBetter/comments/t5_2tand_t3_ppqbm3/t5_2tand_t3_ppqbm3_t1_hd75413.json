The harder the task or having not done it before will make it look like you're more intelligent than others.\n\nMy recommendation is to speek out experiences and aim to become a Jack of all trades. Sure genetics has a hand in who you are but so do you. Focus on you and what you can do. Make what you have work for you and don't waste time wanting what you don't.\n\nBest of luck", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppqbm3/is_there_any_way_to_increase_intelligence/hd75413/"}
