Maybe you feel like you\u2019re struggling with everything because not everything is curated to fit with your learning style. \n\nDon\u2019t want to jump the gun here and throw wild accusations, but I think it\u2019s worthwhile you looking into ADHD if you really feel like you struggle with daily tasks and understanding instructions. \n\nI was pretty gobsmacked to discover ADHD isn\u2019t just the child who can\u2019t sit still and that there are different types. \n\nBut otherwise, it\u2019s really difficult to measure intelligence! If you want to improve at specific things, then practice is key\u2026 and of course, interest. \n\nThere are also many vitamins that you could take to improve brain focus too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppqbm3/is_there_any_way_to_increase_intelligence/hd77sb1/"}
