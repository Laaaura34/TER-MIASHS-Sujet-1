I also encourage you to learn about the differences between having a growth mindset versus a fixed mindset, and practice thinking in ways that permit growth.  These ways of seeing yourself and your potential positively are critical to improvement, because if you believe you are stupid you will limit yourself and fulfill your own prophecy.\n\nI like to say that nobody knows anything until they learn it.  Babies aren't stupid, they're just ignorant.  So do what you said.  Read, listen, observe, and learn.  The more bits of knowledge you gather, and the more you practice asking questions and finding answers, the more you will be able to associate related concepts and apply them in novel situations.\n\nYou may be surprised at what you're able to achieve when you think critically and put in the work.  Intelligent people don't necessarily know a lot, but they learn how to learn.  You can do it, too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppqbm3/is_there_any_way_to_increase_intelligence/hd6i368/"}
