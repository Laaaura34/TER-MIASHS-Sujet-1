Highly intelligent people tend to experience a higher degree of anxiety which skews their perceptions of their ability heavily in the negative direction to the point where they actually believe that they\u2019re stupid and worthless. And hypothetically if you do fail often, who\u2019s to say that failure is due to a lack of intellectual ability? It\u2019s just as probable that the negative belief that you\u2019re stupid combined with mental health issues is causing the failure(if you\u2019re even failing as much as you think you are.)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppqbm3/is_there_any_way_to_increase_intelligence/hd5x5uo/"}
