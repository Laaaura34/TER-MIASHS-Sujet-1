This is because I used to be goals + vision, but I realized that I lack the discipline to be committed to my goals, it seemed extreme to me. Having systems made it easier for me - a framework I follow everyday thats guaranteed to drive me towards achieving some goals, rather than a fixed mentality that I MUST be achieving my goals and working towards them constantly. Vision is hard to pin down, but a blurry vision is better than none, in my experience. I work with my blurry vision and my systems in place help me refine it with time. This doesn\u2019t always work, because you might end up wasting time. But for the most part it does, especially if you have poor mental hygiene like I do.
