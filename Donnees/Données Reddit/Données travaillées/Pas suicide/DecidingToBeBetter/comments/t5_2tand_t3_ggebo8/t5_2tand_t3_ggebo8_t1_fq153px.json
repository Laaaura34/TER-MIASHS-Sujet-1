You're the first person to tell me this - my parents are not usually happy with the fact that I lose interest so quickly. \n\nLet's clarify your point =) All of my friends just have their zone. One dude's a grandmaster at Overwatch, another is just good at any game he touches, a third is smart, athletic, and good at games, a fourth (my best friend) has her K-Drama etc. They just vibe with whatever they have and I clutch a fountain pen hoping that it will satisfy my thirst to be part of... Something. Perhaps my friends feel like this too, but I'll never know. \n\nThanks for the image! I guess it never feels that way to me. Hindsight is 2020 - I'm hoping for a clearer image eventually.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ggebo8/i_cant_find_my_passion_and_im_stuck/fq153px/"}
