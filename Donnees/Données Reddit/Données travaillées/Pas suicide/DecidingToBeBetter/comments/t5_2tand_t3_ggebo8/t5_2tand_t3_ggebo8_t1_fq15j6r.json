I actually learned ASL for a while because I thought it would be interesting and it was. I can sign a number of things, which took me a while to learn. I'm sure it's not grammatically accurate but I tried my best!\n\nTime will show things is truly a lesson I need to learn. I admire your story and passion, truly (although my interest in computers ends at basic coding and video game creation... Sometimes). However, you have achieved much and I really look up to you =) \n\nThank you for the words of encouragement!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ggebo8/i_cant_find_my_passion_and_im_stuck/fq15j6r/"}
