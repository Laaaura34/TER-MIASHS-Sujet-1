The happiest and most interesting people I know are the ones who take the journey a step at a time. \n\nYou are way too young to be able to magically divine what you\u2019ll be into in 30 years. In the meantime, trying everything that tickles your fancy until you find one that you never want to stop is the route to an interesting life. \n\nWhen you are 50 and at a party and meet lots of different people, this time of trying everything will give you so much fodder to connect with everyone on some level. \n\nAnd eventually, there will be something that sticks and calls you to devote yourself to it. Or there won\u2019t, and you\u2019ll be the kind of guy who can hang anywhere, with anyone. \n\nThere is no losing proposition here.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ggebo8/i_cant_find_my_passion_and_im_stuck/fq00d01/"}
