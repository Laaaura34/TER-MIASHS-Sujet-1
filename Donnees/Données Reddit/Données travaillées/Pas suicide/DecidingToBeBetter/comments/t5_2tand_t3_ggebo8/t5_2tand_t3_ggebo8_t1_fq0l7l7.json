Thank you for inspiring me to do more! \n\nYour age does not matter at all - it is commendable that you try to enrich your own life with hobbies.\nMay I ask what you mean with \"everyone around me has a set passion and is really good at it\"? In my opinion, those kinds of people are mostly quite boring - unless they found out the \"set passion\" after a lot of trials and tribulations :) The best advice I ever got is to never stop learning - pretty simple advice but quite important, especially if you are not in a structured environment for that anymore (ie School). \nThe best advice I can give you is to slow down. You're not in a rush. You will probably always try out new things - until you maybe find a passion. \n\nAlso, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/3aw5gd/image_what_success_really_looks_like/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Success is at the end of the day a very personal concept, so don't compare yourself to others. You might not know what success means yet - I don't and I'm 25!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ggebo8/i_cant_find_my_passion_and_im_stuck/fq0l7l7/"}
