I\u2018m getting a new perspective on what it actually means to be there for myself and this helps me wanting to do exactly that more in the future. I\u2018ve struggled with self hatred for a long time to the point where I didn\u2019t even understand anymore why and how I possibly could love myself and couldn\u2019t see the point in taking care of myself.\n\nYou make it sound logical and easy to realize. I know it takes practice and your post inspired me to take my time and practice self care.\n\nThank you for inspiring people!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/prpc9o/thank_you_me/hdkgdjj/"}
