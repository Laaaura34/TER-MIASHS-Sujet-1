In my mind it was going to be easy, like when I was in my 20s and an active paratrooper. I was horrified to find it very hard. I was so out of shape that a 1/4 mile on the track completely smoked me.\n\nNow I am running (slowly) 4 - 7 miles daily and it feels great.\n\nKeep at it and remember the only easy day was yesterday. \n\nPS, something that help greatly was a step counter APP on my phone.
