I would also recommend the book \"You're not listening: what you are missing and why it matters\" by Janet Standen. I feel like it helped me become more skilled at this.\n\nAs for the \"feeling watched\": I know that feeling and I think it's also related to the listening part. It means your focus is probably on yourself during the conversation (because you're feeling insecure). Once you're fully invested in what the other person has to say it'll probably fade, as you are focused on them and not your fear of making a mistake. \n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/llb7e2/3_areas_i_have_to_improve_on_zero_clue_how_to_do/gnoiwqn/"}
