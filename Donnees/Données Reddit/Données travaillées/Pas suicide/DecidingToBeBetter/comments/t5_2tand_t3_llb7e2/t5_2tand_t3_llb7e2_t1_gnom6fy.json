Could you please help me?\n\nOn the other part, I think it's about both - about seeing that lots of people see these patterns of mine, and so I do want to break them cause if many people notice them they might be actually real, and I want to make sure to be the best I can to have healthy relationships.  \n\n\nI've just started therapy, and I'm currently going through a text-book on DBT to help me regulate emotions, and becoming more aware of myself and the surroundings.   \nWhat else could help in your opinion?  \n\n\nThanks a lot for your message!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/llb7e2/3_areas_i_have_to_improve_on_zero_clue_how_to_do/gnom6fy/"}
