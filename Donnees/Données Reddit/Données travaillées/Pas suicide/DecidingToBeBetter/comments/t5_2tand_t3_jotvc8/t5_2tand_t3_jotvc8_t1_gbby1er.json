These don't have to be serious such as puppet history (one of my faves) but it can spark an interest to dive deeper.\nKurzgesagt is also really good at explaining things in an interesting way. \nSkillshare is a good way to to learn skills of course though the number of courses there might be a little overwhelming at first. \nThere's also a lot of places out there such as future learn and EdX with free courses designed by universities. You only have to pay if you want a certificate so this is also a great way to explore interests and learn new things.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jotvc8/24m_with_too_much_time/gbby1er/"}
