Feeling alone sucks.  I'm glad to see you're trying to find friend online and I would add that you can find friends most easily by being yourself.  Your post feels very honest but also very angry.  My only suggestions are to exercise to work off the anger.  While exercising you might make new friends.  As for online friends, they can be hard to find but they are out there.  Just like you looking for others to talk, text, or game.  If you're looking for a online gaming friends try r/steamfriend, r/PSNFriends, or r/XboxOneGamers.  You can even PM me and I'll add you to my list.  Try to stay positive.  Don't get down on yourself.  There are lots of people looking for friends, give it a shot.\n\nEDIT:word", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cxjepo/how_do_i_stop_being_a_boring_rniceguy_with_dumb/eylx4l6/"}
