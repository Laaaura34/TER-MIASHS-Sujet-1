Including opportunity cost.\n\nIt's very good advice to not over plan everything. But it needs to be about a quick consideration of risks. How much does it matter if this goes wrong, what are the worst realistically likely outcomes and how hard is it to fix or how bad is the loss if they happen? Usually the answer is \"oh, is that all I was worrying about?\"\n\nBut you should still ask the question.\n\n(Sometimes starting it *is* starting to seriously plan and organise it. So it still holds true really.)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9a3of/advice_do_the_thing/hgv5oo9/"}
