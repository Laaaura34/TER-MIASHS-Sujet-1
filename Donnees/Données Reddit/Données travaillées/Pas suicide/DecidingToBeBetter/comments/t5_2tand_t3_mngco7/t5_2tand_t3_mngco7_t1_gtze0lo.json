The reason why I posted this achievement is because it has been the hardest thing I've ever done and I can't believe sometimes I managed to do this. Most of the family members in my moms family are life-long smokers and I thought I was going to end up that way too. \n\nYou're never in too deep. I was using nicotine 24/7, no one around me was as addicted to it as I was. So if I can do it, I believe you can do it too. I mean it. Just be ready for a whole week of difficulty, have gum or lollipops to suck or water to distract you when a craving kicks in. \n\nAlso with gaining weight, I think that's better and more managable than the health hazards that nicotine cause, heart, lung, stomach, skin problems.\n\nWish you the best! \ud83d\udcab", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mngco7/i_quit_nicotine/gtze0lo/"}
