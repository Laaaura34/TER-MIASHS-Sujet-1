That's huge. \n  I quit after getting addicted after having only four cigarettes -- four!!  My body and my mind went to war over it.  My body kept coming up with reasons I'd just have to smoke, and my mind had to defeat it.  The worst part is when you think you're completely over it and your body says, \"Well, now that you know you've quit,  one won't hurt.\"  To that, my mind said, \"If you have popped up in my brain, I am not completely over you.  Sorry, no.\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mngco7/i_quit_nicotine/gu00m26/"}
