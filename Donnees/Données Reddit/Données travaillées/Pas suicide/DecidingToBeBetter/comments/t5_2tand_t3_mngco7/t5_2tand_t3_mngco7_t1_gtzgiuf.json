It definitely is tough to quit. Been maybe 5 years for me and I still get a craving sometimes. You\u2019ll save lots of money, your skin will look better, you won\u2019t wind up with burns on your clothes or in the car, you won\u2019t have to step outside in crappy weather for a smoke, and your lungs will start to heal themselves. \n\nIf you get the urge to smoke, be sure to have a plan in place. Have a friend or two on speed dial or have a plan to set a timer for 10 minutes until the urge passes. Or have a plan to brush and floss your teeth. Or what ever might work for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mngco7/i_quit_nicotine/gtzgiuf/"}
