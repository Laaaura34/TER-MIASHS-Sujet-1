I can only speak to my experience, but I spent most of my 20s not quite overweight but kinda squishy round the middle. When I made yoga and weight lifting a regular part of my week, I noticed I had more energy and genuinely liked challenging myself and meeting fitness goals. Within a year I lost about 25lbs and noticeably built muscle. The number of compliments about my physique I got from people who noticed my improvement was honestly unexpected. I didn\u2019t think I was that big before but the change was enough to alter peoples perception of me and to be honest it was a huge ego boost. \n\nTLDR: Exercise is healthy and also makes you attractive", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h993or4/"}
