I've been eating healthy food and I definitely notice a difference in my energy levels. \n\nI'm going to sign up for a boxing gym or possibly muay thai within the next couple months.\n\nI'm working on quitting marijuana as well at the moment as I feel it really keeps me in a state of comfort, as well as making me feel like a little kid while I'm smoking it.\n\nI think I get what people are saying about it not being a masculinity problem, and being more of a confidence problem. I think my need for perfection is another challenge that I need to overcome too.\n\nYou guys have made such a positive impact on me, and I would really like to try out a landscaping job and face my fears.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h9fvchm/"}
