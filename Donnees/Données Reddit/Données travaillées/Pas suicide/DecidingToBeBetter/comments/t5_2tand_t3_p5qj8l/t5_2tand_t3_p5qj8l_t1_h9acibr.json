At the end of the day or after efforts (try and error) you will get better and better and create something which you can see/touch and be proud of. That is really rewarding and  also gives you confidence as you are getting good/better with everything you do more often, even if it takes some time/effort. \nThis can be anything  like gym/work out, carpentry, woodworking, gun shooting, building bows/arrow, etc or sewing if you like it. Along with new skills you will gather various experiences which you can be proud of and discuss with like minded men/people. I think you just lack of different kind of experiences and you should just try new stuff until you find something interesting and then hang in with passion. \n\nJust do something you like and want to get better with. \nAutomatically you will have a better image of yourself. Working out might be one of the essentials here.\n\nHave fun mate!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h9acibr/"}
