Especially what scares you. Fake it till you make it. Social anxiety? Go to a bar alone and try to make friends. Want to be physically tougher? Barbell exercises. Climb mountains, swim in wild water, go camping alone. Once you become proficient at difficult activities, you will have respect for yourself and more confidence. Others will notice. Be patient with yourself though, difficult things are difficult. \nMaybe find some men in history you admire and try to emulate them. Theodore Roosevelt is an awesome example because he largely made himself. He overcame tragedy, sought out struggle and sucked the marrow from life at every opportunity. His little book \"The Strenuous Life\" is something I think everyone should read.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h9ayink/"}
