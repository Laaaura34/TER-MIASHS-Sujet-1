Muay Thai would be good or Jiu Jitsu would help bring forth a more confident version of yourself without having to put yourself into potential brain damage from sparring. \n\nFor myself I began with jiu jitsu because I wasn\u2019t into getting punched in my face but as the years passed I\u2019m comfortable now with adding Muay Thai into my life, it\u2019s helped me work on bettering my technique and advancing mentally and physically from session to session which in return gave me a greater deal of confidence once I felt confident enough I competed and tested myself which helped release my timid past self. \n\nI don\u2019t intend to say that you need to do exactly as I do, but maybe start in this direction will help you achieve what your after. I know lots of people who have completely transmuted into a new person just from martial arts alone. \n\nJust an idea, hope this suits you well\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h98oclo/"}
