You like gardening? Dig up some yard or buy some pots and learn to grow plants. Do random research on soil composition and growing tactics. Learn random facts about these plants. Nobody is more interesting than the person who knows what they're doing and has a passion. \n\nGardening is just an example, bit the basis is that men are beings of passion. We love to specialize in things and put a ton of effort into things that not everyone has an interest in, but we respect each other for our capabilities. \n\nFind something you want to do and dive in headfirst. Help people out when you have the opportunity. Find responsibilities and be reliable. Those are the manliest things you can do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h98cbep/"}
