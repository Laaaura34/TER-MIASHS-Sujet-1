And yet, I command a fair amount of the good stuff (respect, etc.)\n\nI took a course once, the landmark forum. Not for everyone but it made me love and accept myself.

As long as you can love yourself and be cool with you exactly as you are; you can breeze through a lot of stuff that was once intimidating. \n\nYou will do it!!!\nBest of luck", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h995lgb/"}
