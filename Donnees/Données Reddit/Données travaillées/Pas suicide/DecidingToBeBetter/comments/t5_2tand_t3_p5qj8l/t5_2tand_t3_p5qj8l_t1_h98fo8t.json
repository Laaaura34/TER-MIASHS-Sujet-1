A lot of the usual advice on \u201ctoughening up\u201d is extremely toxic to those around you but also toxic to YOU. Don\u2019t learn these \u201ctough\u201d things that later will be difficult to unlearn while you deal with the social and emotional fallout of these habits and mindsets. Just don\u2019t.\n\nREST OF POST IS ACTUAL SUGGESTIONS\n\nI\u2019ve worked with skilled tradesmen for the past 7 years, but I\u2019ve been on the sidelines as a dispatcher. I get to know these guys *extremely* well, since they can open up over the phone. More importantly, I know their bosses and what the boss wants from them (worked large corporate and small businesses). I know their life stories, their worries, the types of jobs they like and the types of jobs I have to talk them into. I know their birthdays and their wife\u2019s\u2019 names and their kids\u2019 names and the gossip with the other guys I work with. And lately I see them all the time physically, and I know how they appear and act. \n\nEye contact isn\u2019t as necessary as you think it is, but *posture* is a main one. Shoulders straightish, back of your head in line with your shoulders, chin up, and eyes forward. A slump will be your downfall, so make sure to hold this posture as often as possible for as long as possible, while walking as well as while you\u2019re sitting. Slumps are partially seen as not confident but mostly a sign that you\u2019re not taking care of your body properly, and that is a very necessary aspect of the tradesman field. Every day they hear of another colleague that has to retire at 50 because of bad knees, bad back, pulled tendons, etc. You have to show that you know what it takes to do the job longterm. Please also take moderately long strides, a shuffle is seen the same way. \n\nBeing outspoken isn\u2019t really needed in this workplace, but it will be needed to some degree in an interview. Bring notes if you need but don\u2019t over rely on them. Compose a reason they should hire you, especially if you don\u2019t have background. Skilled traders are either not willing to work with newbies at all or very open to training someone good (and they will not always advertise this, so spread that resume). You\u2019ll want to highlight things like \u201cI take pride in a job done right,\u201d \u201cI pay attention to detail,\u201d \u201cI love to learn new things, and I listen well,\u201d and (if prompted) \u201cI like getting along with my coworkers, but I\u2019m not interested in workplace drama.\u201d\n\nA bit of eye contact is good, but only on the parts you want to emphasize, like (eyes looking at the desk) \u201cI like getting along with my coworkers, but\u201d (eye contact) \u201cI\u2019m not interested in workplace drama.\u201d (break eye contact) This is honestly a good all around rule, with a split second of glancing up for eye contact occasionally (every 3-5 sec) to make sure they\u2019re still listening and to gauge their reaction.\n\nLastly I would recommend looking into a lot of skilled trades, since you only mentioned two. There\u2019s electricians, painters, flooring guys, tile guys, roofing guys, HVAC. (Any home renovation stuff you can go straight to your local Home Depot/Lowe\u2019s and ask for their subcontractor business to apply.) There\u2019s general construction that get jobs from the state. Airplane repair. Plumbing. You can learn to repair basic home appliances and maintain the yard to be a live-in apartment maintenance guy, and that\u2019s a pretty cushy job with housing included. There\u2019s also more targeted commercial work, like electric water cooler companies or maintaining coffee machines. There\u2019s LOADS of opportunities out there, and there\u2019s sure to be someone who is desperate to hire a person who genuinely wants to work.\n\nBe aware that many openings will require you to have your own insurance, so I would do research on the ones needed in your area. When asked in an interview, say \u201cI don\u2019t have one yet, but I\u2019m looking at X (and Y). What do your guys have?\u201d\n\nI know I wrote a whole damn essay, but I\u2019m passionate about getting people work if they want it and have honestly loved working with skilled tradesmen. They\u2019re a mixed bag but for the most part pretty cool and/or very invested in the job. If you do get hired and don\u2019t feel like you belong, ask for more work when you\u2019re slow, ask questions, engage in talk with coworkers, you\u2019ll be fine. The major thing long-term guys ask themselves about a coworker is \u201cis he going to be lazy and make me pull his weight before we eventually fire him?\u201d Prove you\u2019ll pull your weight, and few people will have an issue, no matter your personal quirks.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h98fo8t/"}
