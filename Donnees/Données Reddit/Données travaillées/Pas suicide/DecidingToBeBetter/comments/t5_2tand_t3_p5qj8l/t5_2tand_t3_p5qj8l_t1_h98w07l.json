It took me a while to get to this point though and I had to work to get to thinking this way. The way I see it described is not in line with my values and I could care less. The downside of this is that there are things men say and do and are expected to go along with that I don't and it can be somewhat alienating. But I would rather be who I am than try to go along with something I don't vibe with.\n\nI can also relate to being fearful and timid and something that I've done a lot of to change that is mindfulness meditation and cognitive behavioral therapy to be aware of self-limiting thoughts and negative ideas. This helps me change whatever story is creating fear for me and keep me on track for what I want. \n\nWhat you can do in concrete terms is to get to know yourself and accept yourself. It sounds cliche, but think about and maybe write down your core values - friends, family, freedom, whatever is important to you. What are your best qualities? What is unique about you? How can you use these things to work on feeling shy and timid. You can't control your emotions necessarily, but you can change how you relate to them internally and how you act and what you do when you experience them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h98w07l/"}
