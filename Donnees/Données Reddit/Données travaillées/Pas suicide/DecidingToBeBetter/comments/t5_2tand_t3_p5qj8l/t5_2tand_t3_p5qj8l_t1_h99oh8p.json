Not any though, very traditional martial arts.\n\n\nAs a wing Tsun student for the last 10 years, nothing has instilled more discipline, humility and confidence in myself than this. Can't recommend it enough! Chinese martial arts in particular due to the strong philosophical roots embedded within them that come from buddhism, confucianism and taoism.\n\n\nAside from that It's one of those things that can't be taught from a YouTube video (despite what these so called \"masters\" will tell you in their \"content\"). And it's not something you can look up the answers for on Google. A very rare thing these days! It can only be learnt by doing, and doing for a long time!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h99oh8p/"}
