It\u2019s literally the worst feeling (at first) but it\u2019s worth it. Like others have said, no one thinks about us as much as we think about ourselves, so when you\u2019re enduring the discomfort, try to embrace it.

I forced myself to do it, obsessing over what others probably saw when they saw me coming down the street. Now, I couldn\u2019t care less about my very red face and obvious sweat marks, I have improved SO much and I tackle hills with ease now.
