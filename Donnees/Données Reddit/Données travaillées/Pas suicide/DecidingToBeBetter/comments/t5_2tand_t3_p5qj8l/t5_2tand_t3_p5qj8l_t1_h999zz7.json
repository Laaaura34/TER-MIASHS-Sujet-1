My accompanying controversial suggestion: try drag. \nIt will allow you to face head first all your insecurities about \u201cnot being man enough\u201d (nothing like simply donning a mere item of clothing (i.e a dress) to shine a light on your anxieties of masculinity) and at the very least will be an experiment in playing with different masks/personas (of which masculinity is one).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h999zz7/"}
