Take the plunge. Only good things can come. Remember to take things as they come. You dont have control over what will happen. You will know how to react once you are in the position where it is needed for you to react. If you feel like you can improve... then you work whatever it is you need to work on. If you feel like its not for you, then you find something else. Maybe you arent great at everything but Im sure you can find something that fulfills you and are amazing at. If you never try it then you will NEVER find what it is that you are looking for.
