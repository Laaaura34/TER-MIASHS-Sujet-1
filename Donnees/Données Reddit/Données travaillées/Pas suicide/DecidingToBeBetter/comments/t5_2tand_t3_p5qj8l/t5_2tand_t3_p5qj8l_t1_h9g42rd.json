When I was younger I acted how I felt and constantly made a bad impression. My breakthrough was learning to act friendly, relaxed and welcoming to everyone, to give off the the vibe that I was confident enough I could be nice to everyone and not care what they thought of me (when I was young I was so afraid of being rejected I was always sarcastic and or quiet as a defense mechanism). The key reason I was able to turn this switch in my head was realising that a/ people are lazy and will just believe what you tell them or show them about yourself and b/ you have to \u2018sing for your supper\u2019. What I mean by that is that no one will proactively come and appreciate you without a reason, so you need to be a positive experience for them in order to have them seek you out, spend time with you or want to help you. It may be different for men and I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ve totally nailed it but I hate to think what my life would be like if I hadn\u2019t made this progress.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h9g42rd/"}
