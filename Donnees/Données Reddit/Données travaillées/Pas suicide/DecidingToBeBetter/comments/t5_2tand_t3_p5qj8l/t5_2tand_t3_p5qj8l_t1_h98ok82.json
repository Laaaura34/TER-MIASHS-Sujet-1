I chat when around people and I focus on my work when left to my devices. Shoot the shit talk about current events or whatever tf when people gather around laugh get to know people. The reason is the more you attempt to stand out and away the more attention you will bring to yourself. Fake it to you make it I didn\u2019t start looking people in the eyes and talking to women till I was 19 at 22 I can\u2019t keep my eyes off people now. Just stare into their eyes and blink just focus on the pupils and nothing else. Command their eyes and they\u2019ll look away first look around every now and then during the conversation smile and shoot the shit. That\u2019s all it takes I been in industry since I was 17 my coworkers noticed my quietness and it often brought more attention than not being by myself lol. The best part about being friendly with everyone they often over share information and you get to know people very quickly. The amount of shit I\u2019ve heard over the years that people just blatantly say and share is insane. Im the monitor the room quietly type I have heard and seen some shit BUT I play the good guy on everyone\u2019s side so when people get to blaming and arguing I sit back and keep away from that shit. It\u2019s always good to have people to keep around for personal benefit at work. May sound shitty but I didn\u2019t move up as quickly as I did being timid and sitting in the corner lol", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h98ok82/"}
