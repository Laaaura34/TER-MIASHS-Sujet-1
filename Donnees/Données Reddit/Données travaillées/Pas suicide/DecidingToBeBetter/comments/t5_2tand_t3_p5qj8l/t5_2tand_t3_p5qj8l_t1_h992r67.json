Even if you\u2019re timid, I would rather work with that than some of the construction people I know. Timid isn\u2019t bad. And being masculine doesn\u2019t set you up for success.\n\nI think what you want to work on is social skills, not masculinity. And that will be it\u2019s own process, but you can make progress! You\u2019re already self aware about what you could be doing better. (eye contact) As someone with severe anxiety and painful self awareness, it\u2019s hard to get out of my head in social settings sometimes because I\u2019m thinking about all the things I\u2019m doing wrong and what other people are thinking looking at me.\n\nFeeling comfortable in your own skin takes a lot of time, and there will be good days and bad days. There are lines we need to draw though so we can maintain self respect, and one hard line for me is to not change for others. \n\n\u201cBecoming masculine so that you\u2019re more accepted at a job site.\u201d Does this seem like something that says you respect and accept yourself? You don\u2019t have to change to be accepted by other men. And acceptance from strangers is not something we should chase, we find it within ourselves.\n\nMy advice, focus on eye contact and try to make some progress there. Even if it\u2019s forcing yourself to be uncomfortable, it will get easier over time. Eye contact can make us feel vulnerable, but vulnerable isn\u2019t bad. You\u2019ll adjust to that feeling and then you\u2019ll be a pro :) just keep focusing on one thing you want to improve socially, and you\u2019ll make progress.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h992r67/"}
