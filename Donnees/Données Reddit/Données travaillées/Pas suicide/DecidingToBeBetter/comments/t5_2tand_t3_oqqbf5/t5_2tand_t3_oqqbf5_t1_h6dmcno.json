I didn't know who I was then and I still don't know now. \nIf you have fond memories of better times and how you were then, I see no reason why you can't return to your old self with a few more improvements. However stick with therapy and a psychiatrist for a while until you feel that it's time to cut back on the meds.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oqqbf5/is_there_a_possibility_of_returning_to_the_state/h6dmcno/"}
