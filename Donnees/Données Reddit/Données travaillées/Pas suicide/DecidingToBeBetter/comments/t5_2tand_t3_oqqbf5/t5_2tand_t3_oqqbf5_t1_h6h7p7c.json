I was probably back to feeling normal in 8 to 12 weeks.  I don't remember exact timeframes because I didn't do anything except stay in bed, eat in bed, and go to therapy once a week. Days were just blending into each other. \n\nI will say that different medications work differently. I've had some meds that numbed me out and I couldn't feel anything. There's no way I could have went through life like that. If that's what you're feeling and the meds aren't working at all by 3 to 6 weeks, I would request to change medications.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oqqbf5/is_there_a_possibility_of_returning_to_the_state/h6h7p7c/"}
