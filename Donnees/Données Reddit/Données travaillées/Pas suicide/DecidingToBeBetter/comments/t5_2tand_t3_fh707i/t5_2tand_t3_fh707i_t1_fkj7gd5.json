Women want stability, love, and to settle down with one man. Men don't want to settle down with one woman, at least not forever. They always have a wandering eye. They are always looking for the next new, young, fertile woman. That's what the whole midlife crisis thing is about for men. Men care about sex and power 1st. and women and children 2nd. In fact a man's interest in his own children depends on his sexual interest in the mother. Why do you think so many dads abandon their kids when things go sour with the mother? Seriously I don't know why you all hate what I am saying so much. Maybe it's not what you want to hear but you'd better hear it lest you end up a single mother and/or a used-up discarded fucksock.
