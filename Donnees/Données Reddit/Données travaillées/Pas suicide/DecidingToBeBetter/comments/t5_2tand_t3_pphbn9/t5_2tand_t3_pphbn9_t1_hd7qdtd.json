I don't know if that works but it might help you! For some reason this time around I didn't do anything specific other than what I had mentioned in the post, I just didn't get the urge much. It's easier now because I look at my nails and they look nice and I don't want to bite them and mess them up, so that's what's keeping me going haha.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pphbn9/i_think_i_finally_kicked_my_nail_biting_habit/hd7qdtd/"}
