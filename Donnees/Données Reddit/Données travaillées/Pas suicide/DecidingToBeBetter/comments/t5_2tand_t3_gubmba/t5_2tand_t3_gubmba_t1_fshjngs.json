Opening up takes huge courage - it's really fucking scary to do. Kudos for taking that step.\n\nGoogle your local area for therapists, counsellers, psychologists etc. Pick one, then when you are ready, give them a call. If they don't work out you can always try another. It took me 3 tries to find someone I could trust, it was a session around that feeling of weakness that made me realise I could talk to that person without fear. \n\nWhat you are experiencing is really difficult. Having good guidance and support really will make it easier to work through. Good luck mate.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gubmba/ive_started_removing_the_armor_i_created_through/fshjngs/"}
