It helps you learn how to change negative thinking patterns and properly regulate your emotions. I had a lot of trauma from my younger years and as a coping mechanism suppressed all my emotions and numbed myself with alcohol. On my path to healing I started letting out my feelings and stopped drinking. Like you I was absolutely overwhelmed with thoughts and emotions. Dialectical behavioural therapy really helped me, it\u2019s usually done in a group setting. They give you all the tools and strategies to help you but you\u2019ll have to implement everything yourself. I know I had to work really hard. \n\nGood luck to you:)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gubmba/ive_started_removing_the_armor_i_created_through/fsi0f83/"}
