But in reality, many couples struggle. Relationships can be very hard, and it will definitely make you less flexible in what you can do in life. \n\nI advise you to make sure you are happy with yourself, before starting anything. Don't expect love from someone to fix all the bad feelings you might have. Enjoy the fact that you can do anything you want, without being held back.\n\nJust my two cents.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j4jnt9/im_being_a_total_axxhole_to_my_mom_because_of_my/g7jdn4l/"}
