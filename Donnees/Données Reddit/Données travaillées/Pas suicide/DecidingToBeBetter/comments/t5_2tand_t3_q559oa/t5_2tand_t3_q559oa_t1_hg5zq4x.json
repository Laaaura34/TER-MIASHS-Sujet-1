After finishing, I worked random construction jobs until I got picked up for the job in the trade\u2026 and guess what? I crushed my left ring finger on 3 rd day of job.\n\nIt was really demotivating man. I actually didn\u2019t want to get back in the trade for about a year  until I got a job call from the union where I signed the books the day after I got my trade school climbing certificate.\n\nI almost didn\u2019t take it but said fuck it and accepted. First 3-4 months I was treated like shit because I had no mechanical aptitude and really sucked at the job. I\u2019m at the same comepany 3 years later. Now the responsibilities are higher and work is way more stressful.\n\nI feel like quitting every day but just bite my tongue and accept the suffering.\n\nI hope you have the fortitude and flexibility to endure your hardship.
