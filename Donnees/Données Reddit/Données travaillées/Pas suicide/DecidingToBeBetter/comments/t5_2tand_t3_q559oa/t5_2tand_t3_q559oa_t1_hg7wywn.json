It\u2019s never too late, until you\u2019re dead.\n\nYou are young, and have so many options. I\u2019d look to see what your community needs, and fill that role; leave your parents house and live modestly; learn a trade skill first if you have to, while living rent free with your parents; you can even research programs that will move you abroad to fulfill a specific job. Go to the library and rent some books on self improvement along the way.\n\nIt\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t have a passion to follow; you can still find work that helps you feel accomplished. Continue learning and growing, and developing yourself. Be happy for your friends, not envious.
