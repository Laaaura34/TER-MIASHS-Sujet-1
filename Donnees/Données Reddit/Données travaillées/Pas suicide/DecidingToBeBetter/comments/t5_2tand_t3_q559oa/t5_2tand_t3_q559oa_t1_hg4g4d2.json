I lived with my parents until I was 25 due to schooling expenses and the fact that my city was so. expensive. I ended up dropping out of college because it wasn't a good fit for me/ mental health issues were...very very bad to say the least and I moved in with my bf while having a minimum wage job. My family was disappointed to say the least, but I was more concerned about my wellbeing and putting a pause on things than what others thought of me.\n\nI am now 30, and am looking to go back to school once things \"calm down\" where I am. I think the best advice I can give, while it's hard to do, is **stop comparing yourself to your friends and family**. Everyone has their own pace and you're never too old to switch things up. Happy friends and people often appear happy on the outside, but trust me, they're dealing with stuff too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q559oa/im_26_years_old_no_permanent_jobstucked_at/hg4g4d2/"}
