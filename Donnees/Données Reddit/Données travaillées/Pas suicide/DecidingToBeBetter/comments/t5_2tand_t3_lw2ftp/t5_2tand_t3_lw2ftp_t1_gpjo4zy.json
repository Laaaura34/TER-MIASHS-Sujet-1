That\u2019s amazing. \n\nBtw something to think about, I got stuck on having at least 10k in savings that I was holding myself back from purchasing helpful things. Caved and Spent about $1500 on tech- iPad and monitor-  that has changed my workflow. now two months later has landed me my first $800 client project. Then I invested 2k in stocks (not crazy ones like GameStop) and have made an additional 1k! If you have extra savings there are many ways to make it grow even more :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lw2ftp/ive_done_a_180_and_didnt_even_realize_how_bad_a/gpjo4zy/"}
