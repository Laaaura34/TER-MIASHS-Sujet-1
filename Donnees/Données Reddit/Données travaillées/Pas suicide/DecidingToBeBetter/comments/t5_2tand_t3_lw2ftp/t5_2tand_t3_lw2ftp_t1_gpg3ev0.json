I felt a little weird posting it because I\u2019m not a big poster on Reddit and I didn\u2019t want to seem like I was trying to toot my own horn too hard, but I figured even if one person got something good from it it would be worth it so I\u2019m really glad to see your comment. I didn\u2019t even realize how bad my habits and lifestyle had gotten until I got to where I am now, hindsight is 20/20 I guess, but regardless of what you want to improve on all it takes is one step forward at a time!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lw2ftp/ive_done_a_180_and_didnt_even_realize_how_bad_a/gpg3ev0/"}
