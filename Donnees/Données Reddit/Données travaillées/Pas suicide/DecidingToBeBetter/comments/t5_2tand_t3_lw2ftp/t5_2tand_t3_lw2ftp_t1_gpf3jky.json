He was born there and both of his parents are from Italy and his whole family is super financially responsible so as soon as I realized how serious I was about wanting a future with him I realized I needed to become someone he didn\u2019t have to worry about meshing lives with! I didn\u2019t want to be viewed as a gamble for someone who prioritized financial stability and responsibility. I owe a lot of where I am now to him, not for changing me but for inspiring me to change on my own for the better.\n\nSorry for rambling lol.
