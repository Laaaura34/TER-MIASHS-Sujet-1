I\u2019m looking into opening up a retirement account for myself, figured I\u2019d keep a few thousand in my savings for emergencies and putting a good chunk of the rest into that. I\u2019ve thought about investing but I get so nervous, I really need to do more research on it. My mom has a financial advisor she loves and wants me to meet with her at least once to get some advice so I\u2019m going to do that.\n\nAs for other things, we don\u2019t go out much so my biggest expenses are groceries, and I do allow myself some splurges here and there. I love my Ipsy membership and probably spend a little too much on the add ons, and just caved and bought an Apple Watch to track my workouts. I\u2019ve been wanting one for so long and it felt so good to finally splurge a bit, but admittedly I bought my boss\u2019s as he was selling it anyway (he\u2019s meticulous as a lifestyle so it\u2019s basically brand new) for much cheaper than buying new from Apple. \n\nIt\u2019s so important to let yourself have little treats here and there, as long as you\u2019re hitting your savings goals. I\u2019m about to pay off my car so my next big goal is to start putting money aside for a house down payment, which feels so grown up lol", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lw2ftp/ive_done_a_180_and_didnt_even_realize_how_bad_a/gpjuahy/"}
