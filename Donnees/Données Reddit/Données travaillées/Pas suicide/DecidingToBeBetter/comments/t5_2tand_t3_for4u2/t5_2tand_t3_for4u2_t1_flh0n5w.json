I still have the account, but never log onto it and only change my profile picture probably once ever 6 months so my family doesn't complain (they are all pretty big Facebook users). \n\nI don't get the appeal. It just made me hate everything and everyone I know. I quit my personal instagram account too, and made a hobby account that I post pictures of things related to my hobby, and follow a bunch of accounts of people I don't know in real life, who also post things about that hobby.
