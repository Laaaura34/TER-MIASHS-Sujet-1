Taking my car to get serviced, getting food and litter for my cat, cleaning cat litter box. It sucks. A lot of times, it's just a sense of obligation that ultimately hurdles me over the line, for now. But, I do agree a lot of it is mental health. I have to work on mine. I would recommend seeking a professional, having that healthy space to process, and vent. Keep trying until you find the right person with whom you don't feel judged, and can be free to be honest. And, I'm finding that meds do help. Whatever your recipe is, try to find that. I'm also a minimalist in terms of stuff to keep track of, and that helps balance it all out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q35ayu/i_suck_at_being_an_adult_please_help/hftgt9d/"}
