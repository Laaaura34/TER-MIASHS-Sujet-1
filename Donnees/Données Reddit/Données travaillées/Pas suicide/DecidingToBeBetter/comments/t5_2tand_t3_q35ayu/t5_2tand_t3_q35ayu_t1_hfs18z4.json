I want you to get used to moving physically and you will start to like it. That will overflow into not being opposed to moving to do chores.\nMy suggestions to you are: \nBuy the book off of eBay \u201c the body you want in the time you have \u201c\nI do not know why but weightlifting is good for your mental health. Start lifting weights 3x\u2019s per week.\nEat as much healthy food as you want \u2026 but cut out alcohol and sugar ( fruit is fine) Eat your protein first so it you get too full , you got your protein in .\nI would suggest some fish oil ( Nordic naturals or rescue 1250)  a b complex , vitamin C capsule,( a zinc / copper mix, if you have white spots on your fingernails) -and a magnesium pill before bed . \nIt will take about 33 times for you to go from I hate exercising to- wow I feel great. Power through. \nNow add all the little tasks bc you have your brain and body doing well finally. \nNo drugs or smoking too please.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q35ayu/i_suck_at_being_an_adult_please_help/hfs18z4/"}
