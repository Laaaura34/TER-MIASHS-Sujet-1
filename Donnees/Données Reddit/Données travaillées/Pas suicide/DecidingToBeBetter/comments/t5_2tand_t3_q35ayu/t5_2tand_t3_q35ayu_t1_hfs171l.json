I also get extremely overwhelmed with basic tasks to the point of them piling up to be monumental. Most of the stuff offered as suggestions in this post don\u2019t work for me - and I\u2019ve tried them all. Currently I\u2019m 100% untreated. I find what works for me the most is trying to set aside at least 30 min a day to clean and take care of adult tasks. Often once I get started, that 30 min turns into longer and I get more done. If I don\u2019t get that 30 min done, I also work to not beat myself up over it. I find that the harder I am on myself about these tasks, the harder it becomes to complete them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q35ayu/i_suck_at_being_an_adult_please_help/hfs171l/"}
