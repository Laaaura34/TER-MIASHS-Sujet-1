Pay your bills, shop for food and clothes, personal maintenance like showers and brushing teeth, going to work etc. So when we get to sit down and relax, it might be hard  to get going again and do stuff.\n\nThe second point is about expectations i guess, most things are neither fun nor unfun, just bland neutral. Taking out the trash, changing your sheets, painting a room, cooking dinner, it's all mostly neutral or close to neutral so it can be hard to find the motivation to do them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q35ayu/i_suck_at_being_an_adult_please_help/hfqtueb/"}
