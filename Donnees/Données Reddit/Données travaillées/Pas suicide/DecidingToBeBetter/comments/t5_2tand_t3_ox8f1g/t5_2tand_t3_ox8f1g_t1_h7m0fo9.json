Sometimes I get into a high where I really want to do something for a long time on end, but that kind of passion/inspiration is few and far in between. Also incorporate more free time for yourself. It can be planned empty time where you spontaneously pick the topic to do when the time comes, whatever you feel like doing for that hour. We're not machines. Maybe it's your high expectations that are unrealistic. If you're drawing or working on a project for school, don't expect to be perfect and done in such a short amount of time. If you're feeling stressed out and need to relax and more sleep, please get some. You don't have to have everything figured out or planned out perfectly, your life will slowly unwind in time. Seek professional help from a guidance counselor, therapist, trusted adult, etc. if needed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox8f1g/is_it_just_me_or_when_i_actually_do_a_task_as_a/h7m0fo9/"}
