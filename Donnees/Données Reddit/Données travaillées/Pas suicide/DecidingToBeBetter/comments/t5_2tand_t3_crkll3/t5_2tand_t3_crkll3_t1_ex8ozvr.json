It's only sporadic, and has only started recently, so I don't think I'm too far gone yet. As for a doctor, I can't afford one just yet. Once I'm fully promoted (there's a process I need to go through), I'll have better life insurance through my job. I'll get checked out then.\n\nAs for the keto diet, have any good recommendations to look up how to do that without walking into an obvious scam?\n\nFor training, the gym I plan on joining has a \"team training\" session that looks very promising. It's basically personal training, but you're in a group which is supposed to motivate you more.
