I\u2019m so incredibly proud of this human that I\u2019ve never met in life. Love your mind, love this dedication that you\u2019ve sparked inside of yourself and you will create a body that will reflect all that love and motivation. Here\u2019s a quote from the philosopher Nietzsche (from The Will to Power, not a self help book lmao, don\u2019t read it): \n\n\u201cTo those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities\u2014I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not\u2014that one endures.\u201d\n\nAnd you have felt so much pain, experienced so much shit. You will endure my friend. As a female I can only say one thing.. one little thing based on this piece of text of yours and that is: you will not end up alone, trust me.\n\nSorry, wanted to end it dramatically like that but I have more to spam lol. Starting to workout and getting fit can be a real pain the arse, but fight through it. You might hate it first, then learn to tolerate it and then suddenly you\u2019re absolutely addicted and can\u2019t live without anymore. So fake it till you make it and then you\u2019ll be made for life", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/crkll3/i_am_not_going_to_die_alone/ex7q5ju/"}
