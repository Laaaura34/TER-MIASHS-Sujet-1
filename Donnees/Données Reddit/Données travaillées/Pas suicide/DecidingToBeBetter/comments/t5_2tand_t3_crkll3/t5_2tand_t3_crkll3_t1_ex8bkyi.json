I need to tell you that those are physical symptoms of diabetes and/or an autoimmune disease (most of which are improved by going gluten free, which will take a ton of research). I would highly recommend going to a doctor and considering cutting carbs considerably. Look into the keto diet. It causes a hormonal shift that gives you way more energy and you lose weight super fast. You'll be in a horrible mood for the first few days, but after that you're going to feel great, the weight will start falling off, and the energy will push you in the right direction.\n\nWeight training should also definitely be a part of your fitness plan, because when you lose all that weight you're going to reveal some nice muscle definition. To learn how to work out I highly recommend looking up a youtube channel called strength camp and reading through titles until you find something interesting, and once you get a little more advanced check out a guy named Athlean-X that will help you keep injuries to a minimum.\n\nI don't want to make this about diet alone, so I recommend looking into self help books and stuff. Jordan Peterson is a great resource for men trying to take responsibility for their lives. Check out 12 Rules for Life or watch his lectures on Youtube.\n\nIt's going to be a long journey. It's going to take a lot of self control and mindfulness. But you can spend the next 5 years setting yourself up for a life you were proud of, or you can spend them wasting away. Best of luck to you man, and never forget why you started.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/crkll3/i_am_not_going_to_die_alone/ex8bkyi/"}
