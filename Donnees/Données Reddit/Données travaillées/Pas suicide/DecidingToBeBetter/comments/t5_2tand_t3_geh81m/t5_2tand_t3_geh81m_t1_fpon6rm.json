The fructose in it is very accessible to your body, and especially fresh fruit comes with very useful and accessible vitamins (D, A, C, etc). I have been dehydrating fruit too, and there is some discussion over whether dehydrating degrades some vitamins, but the more heat you apply to the fruit the more the nutrients are degraded (a great example is jelly). \n\nOne thing you DO have to be careful of is that eating a lot of dehydrated fruit, like kiwis, can make you temporarily & accidentally overdose on certain nutrients. I know that kiwis have a lot of potassium. I used 5 kiwis to make a fruit roll up in my dehydrator and 'accidentally' ate the whole thing a day  before a regular blood test. My blood test showed a rather surprising level of potassium, which was absolutely temporary (and still within normal levels, but a spike from my usual levels). I did research that night and realized I had eaten... 5 kiwis. lol oops.\n\nSo, like everything, all things in moderation, eat a big variety, eat vegetables and fruits but don't eat a billion of one thing every day! Your body can recover from a temporary 'overdose' of course, that's why we have organs ;) but I think the worst we'd have to worry about is diarrhea from too much vitamin C.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/geh81m/replacing_easy_dopamine_fix_with_long_term_self/fpon6rm/"}
