I hope you've been able to manage it a lot better. Tbh, even conversations like this - all this self help and self care stuff is teh reason why I use reddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think it's healthy to be wary, which you are, of your personal tendencies so you can mitigate it. Even this conversation itself is healthy and enjoyable for me as we're understanding each other - i think it comes down to the subreddit that you're in :((\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yeah, all the best to you - tbh I don't think you have OCD as I know people with it and the traits they exhibit are very extreme so yeah, maybe seek some solace knowing that?
