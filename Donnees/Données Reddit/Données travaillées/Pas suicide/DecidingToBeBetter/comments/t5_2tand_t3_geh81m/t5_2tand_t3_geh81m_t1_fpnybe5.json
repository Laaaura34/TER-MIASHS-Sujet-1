So even though you realize later it was a bad decision, you still wire your brain to make that decision again because you got immediate gratification from it.\n\nIt's the same with ordering out when you should be cooking.\n\nIt's the same with skipping the gym.\n\nYour brain gets addicted to making the wrong decision.\n\nSo you have to give yourself positive feedback somehow by making the right decision to overwrite those impulses, or be super careful not to make the wrong decision because every time you do, you deepen that neurological connection in your brain.\n\nSo, when you cook, remind yourself how nice and cheap it was, how you are learning a life skill, how you now have tons of leftovers, etc.\n\nWhen you go to the gym, remind yourself how good you feel after, how you are on your path to a better physique, a longer life, etc.\n\nEdit: if you want more on the neuro-chemical side of things, not heavy science but heavier than what I just wrote, check this video out: [https://youtu.be/icu8hwo4mZY](https://youtu.be/icu8hwo4mZY)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/geh81m/replacing_easy_dopamine_fix_with_long_term_self/fpnybe5/"}
