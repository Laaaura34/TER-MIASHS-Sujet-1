They suggested to take an entire day out of each week as a dopamine detox day - no internet, no SM, no fap, no tv, no music, no shopping, no salt or sweets, no drugs (once every week) - rather than cut one habit out at a time.  It is supposed to be really uncomfortable but that is sort of the purpose, getting that brain back to homeostasis.  They suggest to read, exercise, clean, meditate/reflect, work on a project, build relationships and handle things you have put off - but no stimulation throughout the entire day.  Sounds, to me, a little bit like acting as if you are one of the characters in \"American Gothic.\"\n\nI have yet to try an entire day of detox but it sounds like it could be very beneficial after a few weeks.  I never realized how dependent we truly are on dopamine, each and every piece of stimuli (natural or manufactured) presenting a hit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/geh81m/replacing_easy_dopamine_fix_with_long_term_self/fpo4w5r/"}
