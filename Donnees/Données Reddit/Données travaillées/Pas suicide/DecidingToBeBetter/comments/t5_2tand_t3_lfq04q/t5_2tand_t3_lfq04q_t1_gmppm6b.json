I know you left out all the struggles, the self doubt, the hard work and sacrifices you made to turn your life around. And for that you have won my respect for ever.\n\nI am myself at a crossroad just like you were 6 years ago, and by reading your story i realised that i should take more risks. Maybe ? I don't know ?
