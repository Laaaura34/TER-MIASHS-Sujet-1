This is incredible, I really appreciate it. It never occurred to me to try push ups from a different angle. I used to do bodyweight squats in high school so I'll try that again, if I can't do it I'll try the chair method. \n\nI'm somewhat flexible and not that heavy so the mobility/flexibility bit isn't going to be an issue for me, what I'm most interested in is getting to the point where lifting something relatively heavy for me (like a 40 pack of Costco water bottles) doesn't make me feel like I pulled every muscle in my body when I wake up the next morning, or where I don't feel like I'm going to pass out after mowing/raking the lawn.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k3i8n4/im_looking_for_an_absolute_beginners_guide_to/ge3vq6u/"}
