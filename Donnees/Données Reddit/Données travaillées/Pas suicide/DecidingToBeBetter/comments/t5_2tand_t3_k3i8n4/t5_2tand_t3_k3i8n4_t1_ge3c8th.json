Trying to exercise in the evening gives you all day to make excuses for why you can't do it. Try getting up at a set time (an hour before you start work/start your day) every day for a week. If walking outside isn't an option, try doing a set of jumping jacks, or your Nintendo fitness classes. Start small - like one set of 10 jumping jacks. Doing 7 minutes of a 10 minute class is still an achievement.\n\nTry and keep that up for the week. Allow yourself a rest day on Sunday/another day you might do another outdoor activity, but wake up at the same time. Then, on the second week and just a little bit more. Two sets of jumping jacks. One more minute of your Nintendo class. Just keep building one week at a time. \n\nI really like the 7 Minute workout app, but - as a relatively fit person - I still have to pause it for a break sometimes. I'd advise checking it out just as an example of exercises to try, or keep it in mind for later. It makes a great 30 sec timer too. \n\nHolding yourself accountable to waking up at the same time every day is THE most important part. If you wake up sore and everything in your body screams that it doesn't want to exercise? Don't exercise. But still get up at the same time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k3i8n4/im_looking_for_an_absolute_beginners_guide_to/ge3c8th/"}
