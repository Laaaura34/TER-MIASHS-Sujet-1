Start counting your steps!! If you don\u2019t have a Fitbit or a step counting watch, download StepsApp. I used this when I first started out when the pandemic started. I would walk around the house all day long on and off. It adds up, and it\u2019s a great thing to do as you work your way up to walking longer distances. I lost 40lbs mostly by eating smaller portions and step counting. These days, I am walking a 10k pretty often. I am up to a point where I am going to start trying to do a 10k every day of the week. You can do this! Feel free to message me for any questions or help getting going. I also lift weights regularly and might be able to help you get started working on your strength goals :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k3i8n4/im_looking_for_an_absolute_beginners_guide_to/ge3l7de/"}
