In the beginning it felt like a ton and now it\u2019s very realistic for me. Some days I get 12,000 and I know some people do 15-20k or more. You can do it! Start with a realistic goal after tracking what you\u2019re already doing. For example if tomorrow you find you are doing 5k steps a day, set a goal for 7k. Just work your way up! Yes- the band definitely irritates my skin and I need a different one too. Let me know if you find anything good please! \n\nForgot to add: it really adds up just walking around the house. So get up like every hour and walk for like 5min!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k3i8n4/im_looking_for_an_absolute_beginners_guide_to/ge3w58p/"}
