Also halfway through my master.\nHow I went through it:\nSkip the fear\nJust take the action that is needed to finish your master. And don't procrastinate, just do it. You can do this. \nAs long as you don't have a plan, just finish your old plan (finish your master)\nOnce your master is done, and even working a job that fits your master, then you can decide what is your next goal.\nOr start that business, that sounds good.\n\nThe only thing you need to do is to take the action.
