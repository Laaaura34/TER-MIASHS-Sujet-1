It says that people procrastinate because they \u2018have\u2019 to do or they \u2018should\u2019 do anything. The \u2018have\u2019 and \u2018should\u2019 make tasks dreadful and that\u2019s the main reason of procrastination. To avoid it, one has to bring in the power of choice in their inner conversation.
