They\u2019re real, and they\u2019re not small. I dealt with similar things around your age, so I\u2019ll try to tell you some things I learned the hard way.\n\nIf you can\u2019t figure out what you\u2019re interested in, then please take some honest and transparent time to figure out why. For many people, it\u2019s because their parents are emotionally unhealthy and might be verbally abusive, physical abusive, they may gaslight you, be codependent, or any number of other things. For many people at your age, we are just products of our environments. Finding ways to leave home to try and figure out our own selves is pretty important. So, to that end I\u2019ll make some recommendations:\n\nConsider:\n\n1. Changing your major. Don\u2019t worry about how practical the major is. Just pick something that interests you. *Any degree is better than no degree.* Associates\u2019 and Bachelor\u2019s just prove to an employer than you can finish goals and use a computer. If you have a degree and don\u2019t want to do work relating to it later on, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that and many people in the world don\u2019t use their degrees in their careers.\n\n2. Consider finding a roommate. You mention trying to get out of your family\u2019s home. Well, it\u2019s unrealistic - especially in NYC - to try and afford your own place. So don\u2019t!\n\n3. If you\u2019re moving out anyway, then consider going to school online. It will cost less than traditional, and also gives you have the ability to live anywhere.\n\n4. See a psychologist/therapist. Talk to a couple until you find one you like. Not being able to decide what you like means you\u2019re unhealthy somehow. It may be bc of your environment, but nobody has the power to change your life except you.\n\nHope this helps. Hang in there!
