They just all pile up and make me feel guilty about not using them and for buying a them in the first place. Its helped lately to think about what's compelling me to think I need 100 cool and interesting hobbies when I also feel like I don't have time to do all the basic life maintenance things that need to get done. Its been a good exercise to try to enjoy what I have, stay curious about what I actually enjoy doing, and really question when I feel compelled to do something that might be based on impressing other people or comparing my life to that of others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvvvsc/i_emptied_my_damn_amazon_cart/gcmyesk/"}
