I JUST did this with nail polish. I wanted to find the \"perfect\"  dusty rose color (procrastinating from work; ADHD misplaced research hyperfocus kicks in) and somehow I had $30 worth of polish and topcoat in my cart.

Asking for nail polish might seem like a weird gift, but people never know what to get me, and I do want it! And if I never get it, I will probably not miss it since I already have a couple dozen nail colors collected over the years.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvvvsc/i_emptied_my_damn_amazon_cart/gcmr5b2/"}
