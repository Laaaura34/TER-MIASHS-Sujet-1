My therapist said I was in \"crisis mode\" almost every day for a long time.  \nThrough a lot of therapy I've had to teach myself that I need to give myself credit for stuff sometimes. I'm really mean to me and it's been really difficult to teach myself that it isn't okay to call myself an idiot constantly or to self-sabotage things by saying I'm going to fail no matter what. I'm starting to learn that it is okay to be happy about my accomplishments so here I go!...   \n \nI managed to get several state grants and a small loan that will make it so I can go back to school and not have to work (at least for the first year). \nSo, I re-enrolled myself in community college after a 7 years hiatus. I finished the term with two A's and a B! :D :D :D :D   \nI really convinced myself at the beginning of the term that I was going to fail but I put an assload of time and effort into those grades and it payed off. I know its only fall term but I'm so excited to go back in January and I'm incredibly proud of myself for starting something, sticking to it and not giving up!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ecgr3o/i_reenrolled_in_school_and_i_couldnt_be_happier/", "title": "I re-enrolled in school and I couldn't be happier.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Jangle_Bottom_Jeans", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1576695014, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ecgr3o/i_reenrolled_in_school_and_i_couldnt_be_happier/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441314.683324, "replies_charged": false}
