Shes seen how messed up my mom and sister is and ive told her my past trauma and self abuse and shes never turned away from me. Shes very positive and supportive and helped give me the confidence to get a job as a tattoo apprentice that im now 7 months into and doing good. Ive been so stressed and she opens that door and smiles at me and sometimes i havent been to great to live with but she doesnt fudging gove up on me and im in happy tears to know someone loves me this much and i know we will be ok and the stress we are gonna face cant be anything compared to how ive been living here. I feel a sense of calm like we can take on the world.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ngq9m8/my_girlfriend_and_i_are_moving_into_our_first/", "title": "My girlfriend and i are moving into our first apartment tomorrow.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Upper-Buy-8862", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621483563, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ngq9m8/my_girlfriend_and_i_are_moving_into_our_first/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439303.8305888, "replies_charged": false}
