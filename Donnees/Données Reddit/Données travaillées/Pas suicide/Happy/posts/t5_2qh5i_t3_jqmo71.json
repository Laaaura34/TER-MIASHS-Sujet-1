Apologies for formatting issues\n\nSo, today I got to see my partner for the first time in a few weeks (because of classes and other time consuming stuff, and we don't live together). We've been dating for over a year and a half, and I think we're pretty formal with each other compared to others our age, and that's just how I like it. We express ourselves pretty well though, but that's irrelevant. Back to the story lol. Throughout this pandemic, we have always been particularly careful about contact: always masked, and only sometimes hugging. Our parents are potentially at risk, and I think it's more loving to protect each other's family than physical touch. But today we met up to go hiking on a trail (masked and distanced from others), and there was one part where the trail was particularly steep, with roots and greenery everywhere. We reached out and took each other's hands to steady each other, and I know that it's clich\u00e9 but I was filled with euphoria, and I'm still riding on it.  I also lathered my arm in Germ-X once I got back to my car to stay safe. It had been so long, and I could go on and on about how he means the world to me, though this post is probably long enough. For me, it's the little things, and as the subreddit probably clued you in, I am so so happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jqmo71/my_so_held_my_hand_for_the_first_time_since_march/", "title": "My SO held my hand for the first time since March", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ClassicThunder_1217", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604880030, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jqmo71/my_so_held_my_hand_for_the_first_time_since_march/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440649.3607566, "replies_charged": false}
