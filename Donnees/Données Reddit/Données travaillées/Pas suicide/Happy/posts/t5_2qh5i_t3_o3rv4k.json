There's this really cute subway guy who seems like he could have real nerdy friend potential. We have conversed a couple times before this, but couldn't really talk cuz well...he's working lol. Anyways, while I was in line getting my sandwich made, one of his coworkers asked if we could find time to chat outside of work hours lol(we were somewhat slowing down the line because of our convo). Anyways I ended up getting his snap! I'm so happy!
