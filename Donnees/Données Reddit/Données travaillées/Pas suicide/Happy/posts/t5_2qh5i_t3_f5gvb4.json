I knew I had to leave, but was too fucking scared to. So I stuck around like an idiot.\n\nNow, I have no regrets leaving someone due to them not being \u201cgood enough\u201d for me. I just broke up with my girlfriend the day after Valentine\u2019s Day because she smoked. She also couldn\u2019t hold an intelligent conversation to save her life.\n\nI want someone who has different opinions than me, and will have a friendly debate with me. Someone who I can learn from and someone who I can teach. Not someone who I complain to about politics and goes \u201cyeah that\u2019s annoying\u201d.. These are such small things, but I finally know what I bring to the table and I know who deserves me. \n\nSo cheers to finally growing the fuckin\u2019 balls and finally having standards. \n\nThank you cheating ex. You made me realize that I deserve a queen \ud83d\ude0e and I won\u2019t settle for anything less.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/f5gvb4/cheers_to_finally_growing_a_pair_and_having/", "title": "Cheers to finally growing a pair and having standards", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Privateski", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1581978067, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/f5gvb4/cheers_to_finally_growing_a_pair_and_having/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439480.0753582, "replies_charged": false}
