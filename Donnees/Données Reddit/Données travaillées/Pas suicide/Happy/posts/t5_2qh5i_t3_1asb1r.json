She's driven miles and miles in the cold of night just because she knew I wanted to see her. She came to me when I wrecked my vehicle and needed help. She seriously gets me. Things have been pretty rough now and again, but despite that, she's been there, stalwart and vigilant. She makes me feel stronger, more deserving. She tells me I'm handsome and beautiful and I really think she means it.\n\nThings aren't perfect... but rarely they are. We have ups and downs like anyone. Right now we're dealing with a pretty big, unavoidable down. Despite that, we're strong and bound by our mutual love and respect for one another, and it's good and healthy and strong. And even if we don't last forever, in a proper relationship, I know that I will forever have a place in my heart and my mind for her. I am fortunate to have her in my life.\n\n*Every moment spent with you, Darlin', is a moment I will keep with me and treasure.*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1asb1r/my_girlfriend_is_amazing/", "title": "My girlfriend is amazing.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Cablefist", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 65, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1363932311, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1asb1r/my_girlfriend_is_amazing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440875.270047, "replies_charged": false}
