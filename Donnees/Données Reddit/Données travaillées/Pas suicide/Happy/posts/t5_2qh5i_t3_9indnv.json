This is the happiest I've been in general in 3 or 4 years. I still get sad but I'm just thankful I don't feel numb all the time.\n\nThat is all, skip the following unless you want details.\n\nAfter highschool I went to college for a year and dropped out. Although I was an honor student in high school I wasn't preppared for college. This devastated me for a while. I'm back in school now but for a while I just felt like I was behind all my friends and classmates. A friend of mine died around this time in 2016, that certainly took a toll on me. Although I wouldn't say I'm back to being who I was back in high school I think I'm getting their. I finally have the confidence to not stumble over my words when talking to someone I don't know (social anxiety has always been a problem for me) and I'm actually taking steps to better myself beyond pursuing my degree. I've started working out and I've been trying to learn new skills such as 3d renders in Blender, drawing, and programming. \n\nSorry for the wall of text I just thought I had to tell someone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/9indnv/feeling_better_for_the_first_time_in_years/", "title": "Feeling better for the first time in years.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "spymaster1020", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1537834839, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9indnv/feeling_better_for_the_first_time_in_years/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442883.6083345, "replies_charged": false}
