We talked about everything-and felt like we didn\u2019t have to hide anything from eachother. One thing led to another and we felt comfortable to do just about everything but get to home base. God she was beautiful. I\u2019d never felt more accepted and understood. We frequently checked on eachother to make sure we were still comfortable, and asked for consent for everything. \n\nShe\u2019s been pressured to do things in the past, and even though we\u2019re just friends, she told me this was the safest and most comfortable she ever felt, and holy fuck that is an amazing thing to hear.\n\nI really care about her and I\u2019m so incredibly grateful to have a friend like her.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ou0pp1/friend_and_i_shared_our_first_deeply_sexual/", "title": "Friend and I shared our first deeply sexual experiences and I am incredibly honored by how safe and comfortable she felt.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "IAmTomyTheTiger", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 376, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627575693, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ou0pp1/friend_and_i_shared_our_first_deeply_sexual/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635439566.8626878, "replies_charged": false}
