He's highly intelligent (he reads trigonometry and evolutionary biology books for fun), and the kindest man I have ever met. I feel inadequate compared to him, but I treasure my time with him.\n\nI live with my folks at the moment and my favorite part of that is that my father and I get together every few nights to watch youtube videos on the TV. Mostly music videos, sometimes others. When he plays something he knew as a youth, he tells me a story along with it. When I play him something new, I tell him why I like it. Sometimes we play whatever is suggested on the system, and compare notes. Seriously, we play everything from Shakira to Lemon Jelly to Ron Carter to The Who. And I love every minute of it.\n\nI love my dad. I know a lot of my friends tolerate their parents, but I truly love my father. If I just met him randomly, I would want to be his friend.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/40q13g/simple_bonding/", "title": "Simple Bonding", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "silentxem", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1452654342, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/40q13g/simple_bonding/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440871.3693793, "replies_charged": false}
