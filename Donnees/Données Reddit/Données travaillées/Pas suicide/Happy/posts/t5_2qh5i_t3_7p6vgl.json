While her well being was my first concern, we were both missing kissing each other.  She was so kind to protect me as much as possible.\n\nWe kissed for the first time in 2 weeks and I'm sure we will have to go through this again at some point in the far off future but for now I'll never take her kisses for granted.\n\nI can't wait till she gets home tonight!   \n\nSee, 2.5 years ago we rekindled our love after 30 years..long story but when we kissed that day my whole body remembered the magic of her kiss and touch...I knew I couldn't ever let her get away again.
