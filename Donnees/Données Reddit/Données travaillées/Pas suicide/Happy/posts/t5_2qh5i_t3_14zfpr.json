I have been on and off marijuana for that whole time. I had my routine forced to late nights of gaming and marijuana. As entertaining it was, that came coupled with irresponsibility and procrastination. \n\nWell, a week before, out of the blue, I snapped out of the upside-down routine, and I regulated my routine. For the past week I have been trying to be as productive as possible, with getting back to Python.\nToday I woke up 7:30 in the morning made breakfast and tea, took a long, long morning bath, and it had a wonderful effect! Instantly from the stagnant gloom there was full-of-energy bliss. I am looking as everything as a new possibility. I got back to my overdue project which is what I love doing. \n\nJust so happy that I wanted to share. Small things such as week full of discipline can change a LOT. And a shower is the best thing you can do in a day. :) ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/14zfpr/a_hot_morning_shower_can_change_the_way_you_look/", "title": "A hot morning shower can change the way you look at things.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ybl", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1355728978, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/14zfpr/a_hot_morning_shower_can_change_the_way_you_look/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439214.383898, "replies_charged": false}
