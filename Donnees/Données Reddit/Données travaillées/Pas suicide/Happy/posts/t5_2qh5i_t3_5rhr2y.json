They had a lot of parts that were just instrumental and I was coming up with lyrics in my head. I caught up with them after their set and asked if they'd let me sit in on a practice with them. They said yes!\n\nPractice was last night and it went awesome! I've never sung into a mic except for karaoke but they're helping me with harmonies and whatnot. I'm just really excited because they said they like my voice and want me to continue to practice with them.
