I rarely see younger artists being featured in art galleries, so my specific art features are of pieces done by artists under 30! Each post credits the artist and I work with the artists to help them promote the post and gain views to their art! I\u2019m really excited about this project and I can\u2019t wait to share it with people. I\u2019ve always wanted to have an art related career and I finally feel like I can start to achieve that. If I ever end up earning money from this I\u2019d like to donate it to at-risk LGBT youth and eventually I\u2019ll like to buy/rent a building that I could use as a physical gallery and a safe place for kids in the area in the area to hang out with friends, do homework, talk about art, or find mentorship from older artists! \n\nSo far we\u2019re just on Instagram, but I\u2019m working on a website and a Facebook page!\n\n(No link as to not break the self-promotion rule)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fxizr9/im_finally_taking_steps_towards_my_dream_of/", "title": "I\u2019m finally taking steps towards my dream of having an art gallery by starting a virtual gallery.
