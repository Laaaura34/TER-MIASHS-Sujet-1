Even though I may or may not know any of you, maybe someone came to this subreddit that is having a terrible day and is looking for something, anything to make them feel happy. But there is always a silver lining, trust me. I've been through hell and back and learned a lot of lessons along the way. Stop and smell the roses. Life is good! I sit here so grateful for everything positive in my life. Stay optimistic everyone, someone out there loves you!
