But I found another place and the price is very low for that part of town. \nWhen I submitted the application, I included a letter explaining my credit and informing them that I plan on making a good life for me and my son.\n\nWell, something must be working in my favor because the guy called me earlier and I will be moving in February 1st!! Very happy!\nAnd I will have my first working fireplace!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/15jvuq/got_approved_for_an_apartment/", "title": "Got approved for an apartment!!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ayyjayjay", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1356662398, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/15jvuq/got_approved_for_an_apartment/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440773.7495697, "replies_charged": false}
