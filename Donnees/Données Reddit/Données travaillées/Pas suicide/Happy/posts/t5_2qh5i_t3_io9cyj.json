Even though its really long distance we have a lot in common and we actually spend more time together than most couples irl do! Whenever one of us gets upset/annoyed at the other person its settled really calmly and theres never like an argument or anything cause we\u2019re both the kinda people to accept when we\u2019re in the wrong. I love him dearly and since we spend a lot of time goofing off I never really realized how protective we are of each other until he was defending me in a huge argument with an old friend recently. He\u2019s the sweetest most gentle and considerate person I know and just hearing his voice makes me melt. He knows how to dress himself really well and has the cutest looks to go with it. He\u2019s my escape and I\u2019d do anything just to physically be with him rn uwu", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/io9cyj/id_finally_met_my_special_someone_and_i_couldnt/", "title": "I\u2019d finally met my special someone and I couldn\u2019t be happier :D", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "spacep1ll", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1599492148, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/io9cyj/id_finally_met_my_special_someone_and_i_couldnt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439324.2483423, "replies_charged": false}
