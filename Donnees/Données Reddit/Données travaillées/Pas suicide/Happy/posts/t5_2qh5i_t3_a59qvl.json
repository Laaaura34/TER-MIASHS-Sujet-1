I filed all the paperwork myself, didn't get an attorney, stressed about it for months - but I did everything right! My divorce is final! I get out of 2018 as a single lady!\n\nNow, I know this is maybe strange to be stoked about, but all the fellow divorced folks know, if it's the right move, there's no greater feeling in the whole damn world.\n\nOff to start 2019 as a single, 33 year old. Feeling super old and super young all at the same time. Anything is possible now though. Thanks for providing a safe space for me to be super amped about this!
