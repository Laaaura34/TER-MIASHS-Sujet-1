From our first date we had an instant connection, We got together in December and within our first month of being together we both had a lot go wrong. He lost his job, my sisters stopped speaking to me and I spiralled into a really bad depression, in January (a week after my birthday) I overdosed and was in hospital for 3 nights. Then I moved into the only place I could afford and have dealt with the worst housemates since. I started drinking a lot and basically lost self control, and broke down in May after I woke up in my bathtub with very little memory of the night before (except what I pierced together from texts).\n\nHe has been my absolute rock, despite suffering his own depression and feeling like failure, we\u2019ve both dealt with severe money issues as a result of everything, and I was also diagnosed with PTSD in July and I\u2019ve been in therapy since.\n\nToday though we\u2019re getting ready to sign the contract on a new flatshare (together), he\u2019s preparing to start his new job and I\u2019m waiting to get a promotion in mine. We\u2019ve had everything possible thrown at us, but we\u2019re finally getting through it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/daw3ji/things_are_finally_getting_better_for_me_my/", "title": "Things are finally getting better for me & my boyfriend", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "thefabulousbomb", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1569768636, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/daw3ji/things_are_finally_getting_better_for_me_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440705.585532, "replies_charged": false}
