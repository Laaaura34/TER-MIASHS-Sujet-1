I'm only going to have to pay $160 to attend college this year! I nearly failed out last semester and was placed on academic suspension, but I managed to bring my grades up enough with summer classes to have the suspension reversed. I don't know if it is related but last semester I was part of a student lead conversation with the Dean's office on support for students who are struggling with food insecurity and financial instability. It feels so good to know that I'll be able to go into my senior year without worry about finances like I did previously.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/cb2oup/after_a_horrible_semester_where_i_experienced/", "title": "After a horrible semester where I experienced food insecurity to the point that it severely affected my academic performance, I just found out that my school has granted me enough financial aid to nearly completely cover my tuition for my senior year!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "adabbadon", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 50, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1562687707, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cb2oup/after_a_horrible_semester_where_i_experienced/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441293.7844281, "replies_charged": false}
