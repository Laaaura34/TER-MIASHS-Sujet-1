I deferred for a couple years and then did minimum payments.  I also racked up some credit card debt when I was unemployed for about two years back in the early 2000's.  I thought it was a monumental thing that I'd never repay, but I made a budget, settled in, and decided I'd make it my goal to just get them done.  All told it was about $85K plus interest.  I used to get sick to my stomach every time i thought about it. \n\nI just got a notice from my credit card company this morning with my balance.  I looked at it and I only have the last $87 payment this month and it's 100% paid off!  My last student loan payment will be on 1/28 for $382 and that's paid off too!!!  \n\nI'm getting $400 a month back into my pocket every month now!!  I'm so happy I could almost cry with relief that my being a miser, keeping my head down and scrimping finally is paying off with me achieving my goal of getting both these paid completely off.  \n\nTime to open a savings account!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/agetpj/paid_off_my_student_loans_and_a_major_credit_card/", "title": "Paid off my student loans AND a major credit card debt this month!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DrGrizzley", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 51, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1547595166, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/agetpj/paid_off_my_student_loans_and_a_major_credit_card/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438947.1843429, "replies_charged": false}
