I love my job. Who wouldn't? I get health and dental to play with puppets all day. But some days are better than others.\nBefore my last puppet show, a little girl said that she and her grandmother had made their own puppet stage at home out of a cardboard box. I told her and her family to wait around after the show and I would take them backstage and show them how we control our puppets.\nSo I performed the show and afterward the audience cleared out and the little girl's family stayed behind. She got to manipulate a few of the puppets, operate the light board, even control a special blimp we use in the show. All the smiles and wows told me she was delighted and amazed.\nAs they were leaving, the girl's mother turned to me and said, \"Thank you. This was great.\" To which the little girl added, \"Yeah, you're even better than Santa Claus.\"\nMy heart pretty much melted. She gave me a big hug, wished me a happy Thanksgiving, and left. I guess I just felt I needed to share my nice moment.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/13l758/today_at_work_a_four_year_old_told_me_i_was/", "title": "Today at work, a four year old told me I was better than Santa.
