I was 6\u2019 tall (male) and 124lbs. I looked like a heroin Addict. I visited dozens of doctors that told me nothing could be done. They gave me cop-out diagnoses like \u201cIBS\u201d and gave up.  I avoided eating ANYTHING I was allergic to for 15 years while taking piles of expensive supplements, probiotics, and artificial stomach acids until my intestines healed and my immune system reset. Blood and stool allergy tests every year showed no improvement for the first 12 years or so, then they all started improving. Today for the first time it showed all clear except a couple weird things that don\u2019t matter. I can eat REAL food. Like NORMAL people. I can go to a restaurant. It\u2019s AMAZING.  \n\nAlso, \n1: Soylent came out a couple years ago and helped me gain 25lbs, so I don\u2019t look anorexic anymore, that\u2019s been nice. Not as nice as HAMBURGERS THOUGH!!!!! I highly recommend Soylent for nutritional shakes. \n\n2: Don\u2019t bother with freakin American medical doctors. They really do just hand out pills. \nNaturopathic doctors solve problems. \n\nSorry for the long rant. It\u2019s a very big day for me.
