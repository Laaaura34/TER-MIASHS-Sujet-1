I didn't think it was anything bad but then the doctor dropped a bomb on me. She said it was most likely something A LOT worse than anything I had ever expected it to be. In fact, she said she was about 90% certain.\n\nNeedless to say, I spent my Xmas holidays and New Year feeling extremely depressed and hopeless. My family noticed. My friends noticed.\n\nToday I got a call.\n\nShe was wrong.\n\nThe doctor was wrong.\n\nIt was absolutely nothing.\n\nI'm healthy.\n\nOh my god. I feel like I have a new outlook on life and won't take things for granted because of this scare. And an unrelated but also happy note, I think the girl I'm interested in is interested in me too.\n\n2016 is suddenly off to a *great* start.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/3zfclv/im_healthy/", "title": "I'm healthy!!!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Byeka", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 53, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1451923604, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/3zfclv/im_healthy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441323.1618948, "replies_charged": false}
