I used mozzarella cheese, since thats the only real cheese we have in the house since my parents are vegan. My God this was one of the best quesadillas of my life. The was perfectly crispy, and the cheese was so melty and yummy, and because I have low blood pressure I need more salt than the average person in my diet so I put a bit of salt on it, and now I'm just basking in the glory that was that quesadilla. Also, I've learned that olive oil is much better than butter on the pan as the butter burns too quickly but the olive oil soaks into the quesadilla more and it doesn't burn as fast. \n\nWho knew such a simple thing could be so heavenly?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gtbmi3/can_i_just_talk_about_the_delicious_quesadilla_i/", "title": "Can I just talk about the delicious quesadilla I just made?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NarwhalsAndKittens", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1590831496, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gtbmi3/can_i_just_talk_about_the_delicious_quesadilla_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441438.3715737, "replies_charged": false}
