At work today, I made a boomerang, shot off a baking soda and vinegar rocket and built a balancing toy. I love what I do, and the people I work with. I had a moment of realization today that this really IS my job and I'm so thankful.\n\nThe best part of it all is seeing the difference we make to our students. We work with underperforming students who usually hate school, but when they're presented with experiential learning, they dive in. To see a child who's been referred to our program go from not giving a damn to genuinely enjoying themselves and recalling the principals behind what they're doing is amazing.\n\nI hope this is the right place for this post, let me know if it isn't. I just wanted to share.
