To say that I am happy is an understatement. I am shining! \n\n1- I won a baking contest! I submitted a recipe that is a very humble food, and it is something I make alot of.... and it won! \n\n2- A meeting with my son's principal was very positive. I was geared up to defend a compromise between my son and his teacher. The the principle was on my side from the start of the meeting. We spent the meeting talking about how things would develop and change for the better. I was so relieved and walked away from the meeting feeling very positive for my son.\n\n3- My 13 yr wedding anniversary. My husband and I went to a fine dining restaurant for the first time in many years. We sat and ate and just slowed down to enjoy each others company,  the music being played, and all around ambiance. We sat with out a care in the world and it was fantastic. \n\n4- Went to a family night hockey game (that we had planned well in advance). We had a all around good night even though the home team didn't win. The kids had a great time at their first hockey game, and we plan to do it again. \n\n5- Got to see friends and hang out with some family. With everyone so rushed and having many commitments, it was really nice to just be able to hang out today.\n\n6- Planned a meet up with a family member that I have been searching for for many years. This last one is a big deal because it's been years and years in the making. I dont know if I'll be able to sleep because I am so excited! \n\nThis week has pulled me through an emotional rollercoaster of thrills. Seriously dumbfounded at the positive that keeps on shining through out the week.\n\nI really hope that you all have a excellent week ahead.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ai724k/this_week_has_been_absolutely_incredible/", "title": "This week has been absolutely incredible!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Birdy30", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1548049737, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ai724k/this_week_has_been_absolutely_incredible/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438841.6442394, "replies_charged": false}
