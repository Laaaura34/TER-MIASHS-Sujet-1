But I just got hired at a higher pay-rate (but less hours :/) somewhere I won't hate and won't send me to the hospital! \n\nI HAVE A JOB. I can pay bills and buy groceries and not just eat eggs for every meal because I have to. Now I can eat eggs at every meal because I want to! Now, I can pay my student loans and save up money to go to RTX this summer and I can maybe get a gym membership OR MAYBE I WILL JUST HAVE MORE THAN 12 DOLLARS IN MY BANK ACCOUNT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE EVER I HAVE A JOBDFDIFGHSFDJHG\n\nI'm not useless anymore! /screaming\n\nEdit: I wish this was real karma.
