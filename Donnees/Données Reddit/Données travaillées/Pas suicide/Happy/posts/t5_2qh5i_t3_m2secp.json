She wanted me to set up the sheet music in front of her and assured me that she was playing off the charts.\n\nAs a musician, I really want her to come to music naturally and not have it forced on her. When she seeks out jam time like this, it fills my heart with happiness! Best music buddy ever!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XI_EEpHCxiE", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/m2secp/5yo_daughter_asked_that_i_send_this_to_everyone/", "title": "5yo daughter asked that I send this \"to *EVERYONE*.\" We have a small family / social group, so maybe we can share our joy with you?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "robotsongs", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 50, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615475548, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/m2secp/5yo_daughter_asked_that_i_send_this_to_everyone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441518.4586034, "replies_charged": false}
