She was incredibly ill, the only way we could feed her was a feeding tube in her stomach, and she required frequent trips to the hospital, but we loved her. \n\n We knew that her placement in our home was only temporary, but that didn't make her departure any easier. One of the painful things about cases like hers, is that we don't necessarily get to know the rest of the story. Now, even ten years later not a day would go by when I didn't think about that little girl, mostly wondering if she was still alive. Hoping she was, and hoping she was happy. \n\n\nToday I received an email from my mother, and it contained a recent photo of that little girl.  She was still obviously suffering from several ailments, but she had the most radiant, happy smile on her face. I don't know what she is up to now, I don't know many details about her beyond the photo. However, I do know that she is still around, and that for at least the period of that photo she was happy.\n\n That is enough to make me happy. I cried when I saw that photo, and I'm crying about it now. \n\nI don't know if this is appropriately happy for this subreddit, but I wanted to share this bit of happiness somewhere.
