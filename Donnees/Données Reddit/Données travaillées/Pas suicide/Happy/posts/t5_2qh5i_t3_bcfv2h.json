My arms are tender from where the IVs were used, and I feel like I could sleep for a year, but if i never have to be asked my full name, today\u2019s date, where I am, whether or not you peel a banana before you eat it, if I drop a rock in water will it sink, and names and functions for various things such as pens, watches, keys, and flashlights, I will be happy. \n\nJust a side note: if any of these words don\u2019t make sense or I\u2019m missing words, formatting, etc. I apologize in advance. This was a test in focusing and memory which, for the most part I believe I succeeded.\n\n\nEdit: they don\u2019t know what caused the blood clots in my legs or in my brain but I\u2019ve been given a specialist whom I\u2019ll be seeing soon to figure it all out. It feels good to finally be getting answers.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/bcfv2h/on_tuesday_april_9_2019_i_had_a_stroke_was/", "title": "On Tuesday, April 9, 2019 I had a stroke was admitted to the hospital, and I survived!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Bauifox", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1555088057, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bcfv2h/on_tuesday_april_9_2019_i_had_a_stroke_was/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438837.5273407, "replies_charged": false}
