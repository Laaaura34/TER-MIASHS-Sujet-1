I am still struggling to absorb how this made me feel. Nobody has ever showed me how much they love me in such a way and it made me realise how truly amazing what we have is and how I should be cherishing every single moment of it. \n\nShe is truly the sweetest human I have ever enjoyed encountered and even though I\u2019ve always been extremely loyal towards her and treated her well I feel I\u2019ve been emotionally distant due to the place of numbness I have somehow managed to bring into the relationship - we both have similar issue from past trauma. \n\nI recognise that I have a massive impact on how my partner feels and goes about her life. At heart I am a very creative and passionate person and I have managed to convince myself that I am not that any longer.\n\nI am making the conscious decision to let myself be happy and work my way from the awful person I have created within myself.\n\nI will no longer take advantage of what I have.\n\nI will no longer consider myself as being \u2018hopeless\u2019 and \u2018worthless\u2019.\n\nI will no longer allow myself to standby as I go through life unconsciously on a self-destructive path.\n\nI will no longer let my past trauma define me.\n\nI will be happy.\n\n\nJosh\n14/10/2020", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jb4pbx/realisation_about_myself_upon_turning_33_and_my/", "title": "Realisation about myself upon turning 33 and my vow to be the person I want and deserve to be.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "joshg_yz250", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1602695000, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jb4pbx/realisation_about_myself_upon_turning_33_and_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438908.9891005, "replies_charged": false}
