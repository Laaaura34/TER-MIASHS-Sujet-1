We've been with each other only 8 months, have lived together for the last 2. We're perfect for each other. He is the perfect balance of a person that I've craved my whole life. \n\nTakes care of me when I'm sick. Is awesome with my daughter (5). We joke around, both work while sharing household duties - laundry, dishes, etc. We both love the outdoors just as much as sitting around and being lazy. \n\nI never imagined myself getting married, but I now can't imagine not marrying this man. I've been on cloud 9 since the day I met him :)\n\n**TL;DR - Getting married and full of bliss.**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/8iasaz/getting_married_xpost_from_rrelationships/", "title": "Getting Married (x/post from r/relationships)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SamanthaStranger87", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1525911461, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8iasaz/getting_married_xpost_from_rrelationships/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438952.500972, "replies_charged": false}
