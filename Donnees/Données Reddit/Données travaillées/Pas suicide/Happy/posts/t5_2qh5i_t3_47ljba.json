Had a nice sandwich, and a glass of water.\n\nJust ecstatic as it was a super nice blue sky 65F day, and that felt great! \n\nLittle things in life are so wonderful!  \n\nI realize most people will go wtf? But for me to make it a half mile without falling over was amazing. It takes work, and a major accomplishment to even attempt that.   Parkinson's might have robbed me of my balance, but not my optimism.  \n\nJust grateful for the little things in life!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/47ljba/walked_to_lunch_and_i_am_ecstatic/", "title": "Walked to lunch, and I am ecstatic!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ParkieDude", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1456435125, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/47ljba/walked_to_lunch_and_i_am_ecstatic/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438960.3819535, "replies_charged": false}
