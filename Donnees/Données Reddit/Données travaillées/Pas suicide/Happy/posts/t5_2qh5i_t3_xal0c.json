Almost immediately after I got the job he started doing prep work. I've been told by the kitchen manager for the past 2 months at LEAST, that I was going to be the next one to move up, just as soon as he hired someone to replace me. People have come and went, I stopped listening to him but continued to do the best job I could at running that dish pit. Two weeks ago I finally got a pizza shift. \n\nI figured he would let me learn a little bit but I've been the primary weekend dishwasher for quite a while. Today I looked at my schedule and I have FOUR pizza shifts. I only work dish on monday when it's so slow one person can do the job which normally requires two. I'm so stoked. I have a four year degree from a nice school and I should be making a lot more money (only considering what I need to pay off loans for school, I don't think I'm entitled to anything). But being rewarded for the effort I put in is such an amazing feeling. I earned it, the only favor I was done was the job itself.\\", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/xal0c/after_putting_in_a_tremendous_effort_at_dish/", "title": "After putting in a tremendous effort at Dish Washing for the past 4 months, I finally get to cook food.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "FindingMeaning", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 147, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1343469979, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/xal0c/after_putting_in_a_tremendous_effort_at_dish/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440768.2505298, "replies_charged": false}
