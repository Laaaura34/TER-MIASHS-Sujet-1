I can't even pinpoint why, I just always feel mopey this time of year. However this year has been different. My kids are finally old enough to get what Christmas is all about and to say they love it is an understatment. Their excitement has really gotten me to go full elf! \n\nI've been wrapping and baking and even singing Christmas songs! I never thought I'd be able to have children after years of unexplained infertility and then twice in two years I was given the most amazing gifts (both born the same week as Christmas even.) These kids are amazing! I am so thankful for their beautiful smiling faces.\n\nI'm currently cleaning my kitchen while listening to their giggles as they play video games with their uncle. I can't imagine being any happier than I am right now and it's all thanks to them. \n\nHappiest holidays to you all!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/efa41d/i_think_i_finally_found_my_christmas_cheer/", "title": "I think I finally found my Christmas cheer!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Wteffinf", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1577237233, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/efa41d/i_think_i_finally_found_my_christmas_cheer/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439486.7218432, "replies_charged": false}
