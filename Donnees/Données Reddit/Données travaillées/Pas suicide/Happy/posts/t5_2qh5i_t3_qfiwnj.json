I was looking through the offers and i ultimately decided to accept the 2nd highest per year option. Mainly because it was a full remote position instead of a 1 hour commute each way, and way better benefits.   \n\n\nI just feel like a weight has been lifted and my depression funk is starting to go away where i can start to actually see myself thriving instead of just barely surviving.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/qfiwnj/unemployed_for_8_months_then_i_get_4_job_offers/", "title": "unemployed for 8 months, then i get 4 job offers in the same week", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ilovecoloring122", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635174798, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/qfiwnj/unemployed_for_8_months_then_i_get_4_job_offers/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441822.0790243, "replies_charged": false}
