I'm not normally an unhappy person but lately I feel as if I've been in a rut just doing the same old, over and over until the point where I've started to hate myself.\n\nI've signed off a few applications at a few places that were hiring to see if I could make something of myself, and I'm trying to be optimistic about it. I hate myself doing nothing right now, why not be efficient and hate myself at nice price per hour?\n\nThese last couple of weeks I've felt as if I've changed a lot over all and was wondering if anyone else is/has experienced this? (Around 16,17,18) I want to be happy but I feel as if something in my life is missing.
