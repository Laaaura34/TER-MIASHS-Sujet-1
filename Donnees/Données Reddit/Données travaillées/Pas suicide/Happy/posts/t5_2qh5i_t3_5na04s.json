Life can be hard, especially now that I'm embarking on my first full-time job search. But knowing that I have my family and my loving girlfriend at my back makes all the difference. I can't believe how lucky I am to have what I do.\n\nI'm laying in bed right now trying to fall asleep because I have two interviews tomorrow (wish me luck, they're my first ones), and I'm just reflecting on how I felt at graduation. I was the most grateful *not* when I walked across the stage to receive my diploma, but when the ceremony had ended and I got to see everyone there to support me. I don't cry often, but I sure as hell did then. It was over - I had done it, and it was time to start my life.\n\nSince then, my family has been continuously supportive and offered me much advice that I've taken to heart. And I am seriously so infinitely grateful for my girlfriend; I can't believe how lucky I am to have found and kept someone that I truly consider to be my other half.\n\nGuys, I've been in some dark places - holes that I never thought I would get out of. But I can honestly say that I'm proud of where I am today, and I owe such a large part of that to the people that have helped me get through everything. I can't wait to pay my own good fortune forward. \n\nThanks for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/5na04s/im_so_grateful_to_have_such_loving_people/", "title": "I'm so grateful to have such loving people surrounding me.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "QuinSemper", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1484108001, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5na04s/im_so_grateful_to_have_such_loving_people/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440884.276928, "replies_charged": false}
