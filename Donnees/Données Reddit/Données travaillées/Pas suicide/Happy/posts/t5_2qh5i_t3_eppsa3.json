I've just booked tickets and I'm going to see Monster Trucks which I've fancied seeing for a few years and can say I'm finally going. I'm in the UK and don't believe it's that common a show. Its all sorted so I'm going in a couple of weeks. All I have left is to cook a full Sunday roast which I've never done before but will be a lifelong skill once I master it.
