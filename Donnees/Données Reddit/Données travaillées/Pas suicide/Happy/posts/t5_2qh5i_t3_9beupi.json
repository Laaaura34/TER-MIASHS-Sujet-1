At one point I had over 50 credit inquiries, 13 collection accounts, had a car repossessed, and was evicted twice. I had successfully lowered my credit score to a solid 397 (out of 900) and even lowered my wife's score to 413.\n\nAll of this happened for two reasons. I was not knowledgable enough to be granted credit and I never once paid a bill other than rent and even rent was sporadic. I did all of this by the time I was 24 and started with a cell phone at 16.\n\nI turn 31 next month and by the time i go celebrate, I will have 0 dollars left owing to a single collection company (neither will my wife), I will have three years paid (on time) into two brand new vehicles, be in the same home for my 4th year, and will be purchasing our first home next year. By planning a path to better credit I no longer feel like a complete failure for my wife and kids.
