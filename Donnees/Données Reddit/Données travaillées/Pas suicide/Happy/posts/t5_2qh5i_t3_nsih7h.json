I\u2019ve had some financial luck recently, and asked the cashier to buy the person behind me lunch. If there was money left over, I asked them to keep it. It was only $20.\n\nToday, when I walked in, the manager came up to me. She informed me that my lunch had been bought the rest of the month. While the person asked to remain anonymous, I was amazed!
