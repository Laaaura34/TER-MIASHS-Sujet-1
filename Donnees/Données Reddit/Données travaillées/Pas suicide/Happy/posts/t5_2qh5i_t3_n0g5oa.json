So I'm gonna bake brownies too \ud83d\ude01\n\nBut that's only a dessert! I need food too! \n\n* lightbulb * \n\nLet's try making gnocchi! (for the first time)\n\nI'm really excited to see how everything looks and tastes when I'm done \ud83d\ude0a I'm just filled with so much happiness that I actually want to make something and I have the energy to do it.\n\nI hope even a little of my happiness can seep through to every single one of you wonderful and beautiful souls out there \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\nYou are amazing and I love you \u2764", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/n0g5oa/feeling_good_gonna_put_this_happiness_into_the/", "title": "Feeling good, gonna put this happiness into the kitchen and try making some gnocchi, brownies and pocky sticks!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "genericusername0192", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619620441, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n0g5oa/feeling_good_gonna_put_this_happiness_into_the/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439510.2717485, "replies_charged": false}
