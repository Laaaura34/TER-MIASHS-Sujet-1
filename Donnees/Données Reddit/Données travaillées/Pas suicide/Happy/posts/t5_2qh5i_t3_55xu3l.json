This is about two years earlier than I'd anticipated, but a combination of the 12 month internship I'll be doing and a deep-rooted desire to move away dictate otherwise. While it breaks my heart to leave all the friends and community I've built up here, the thought of having my own space and the chance to toil away at something other than the same activities of the past 6+ years excites me. Granted, it will be ultra busy and I'll probably have to pull quite a few all-nighters, but I'm looking forward to it...\n\nThe prospect of an Honours year seems to be really exciting and beneficial as well. And despite having aspired to about 6 different career paths, I think I'm quite close to something I'd be fulfilled doing...\n\nBring on February!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/55xu3l/exciting_new_prospects/", "title": "Exciting New Prospects!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Nonederstand", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1475642057, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/55xu3l/exciting_new_prospects/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439091.7712116, "replies_charged": false}
