I've been exhausted physically, as well as unmotivated and overly anxious. \n\nToday, I managed to eat a somewhat good breakfast despite having loss of appetite, and I took all my meds. I eventually took a shower (washed my hair and shaved a little) and brushed my teeth and put on fresh clothes for the first time this week. \n\nI even mustered the energy to tidy up my depression mess in my room. I'm in bed again, just resting, but it feels good to have accomplished those things. Hopefully I start to feel better soon so that I can get more stuff done. I don't want to be an unmotivated mess anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/owprh0/small_improvements_after_a_very_stressful_month/", "title": "Small Improvements After a Very Stressful Month", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CottagecoreDays", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627944065, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/owprh0/small_improvements_after_a_very_stressful_month/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635443361.3306875, "replies_charged": false}
