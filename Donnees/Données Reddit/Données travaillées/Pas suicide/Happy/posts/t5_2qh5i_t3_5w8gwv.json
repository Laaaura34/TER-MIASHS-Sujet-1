He fell into depression and became unemployed for awhile. He became an alcoholic and abused his prescriptions. He was a completely different person. He wasn't happy with himself. We fought quite a lot a year ago and there were times it was almost our breaking point. Fortunately, there were things we both learned about ourselves during that time span \u2013 we both didn't believe in giving up. \n\nLater that year, he sobered up and learned new things about himself. I even noticed that he appreciated having passionate conversations with me. He made sure to tell me he loved me everyday and was guaranteed he would be out of that rut. Soon, he saw the positive aspects of his life and made sure that I acknowledged that I was a main part of it. I watched this man grow into depression and alcoholism into a man who worked hard to flush out all the toxins in his life away. \n\nI'm so appreciative towards this man who transitioned his life for the better! He puts in so much effort to let me know that I am immensely loved by him. I hope everyone can experience the same feeling that I have. He is so happy with himself nowadays and that makes me extremely happy! Hooray for happiness!
