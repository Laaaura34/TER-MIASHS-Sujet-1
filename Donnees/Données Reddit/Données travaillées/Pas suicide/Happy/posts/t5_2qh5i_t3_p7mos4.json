After breakfast he comes up to me and starts telling me how happy he is to be with me and how much he is looking forward to our future...it was very out of character for him so I knew something was up. Then out of the corner of my eye I see him grab a bag of cat treats and he calls my cat, who is the biggest love of my life lol, and he had the ring tied around a string on her neck. So he literally got my cat to propose! It was adorable and I am so happy. The ring doesn't fit but he gave me his mother's wedding ring (his dad has passed) which made it even more special. I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with this man and I just wanted to share the news!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/p7mos4/my_best_friend_proposed_to_me_this_morning_and_i/", "title": "My best friend proposed to me this morning and I just want the world to know!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "aamnipotent", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 41, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629404097, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p7mos4/my_best_friend_proposed_to_me_this_morning_and_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441802.93933, "replies_charged": false}
