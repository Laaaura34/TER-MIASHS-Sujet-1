This guy who\u2019s new to town this year confronted me late September about being friends. Guys never talk to me so I was actually kind of confused; he\u2019s well dressed, very very attractive, has a very distinct look (guys here are all very basic and wear the same stuff and act the same ways) and was obviously very nervous to talk to me. We become awkward friends but we tried. A week later he subtilely suggests that we should go out. My anxiety got in the way cause I\u2019ve never experienced a romantic relationship before. Almost 4 months later and he\u2019s already the love of my life. He does everything in his power to make sure I\u2019m happy and comfortable, he goes at my pace, is a great cuddler, very gentlemanly, and makes sure that I know he\u2019s there whenever I need him even in the dead of night. There\u2019s been a couple of minor problems previously, but we\u2019ve worked them out within the day or next day and are very good with communication. I\u2019ve always been afraid to show my friends and even family my interests cause they find them weird or gross, like my passions for bones and spiders. He loves it though. We share a common favorite t, the Goliath birdeater and I could not be happier! He knows I\u2019m a little obsessive when it comes to my very favorite things such as my favorite YouTuber. I watch this channel during my depressive bouts even if I\u2019ve seen the videos tons of times before. My boyfriend describes the channel as \u201cvalid, brilliant, goofy\u201d and has no problem binge watching my favorite series from this channel. He\u2019s loved me when I can\u2019t love myself, he\u2019s there when no one else is, and he reassures me my insecurities and doubts and regrets and self hatred is all in my head and he\u2019s helping me get through depression and anxiety and I\u2019m doing my best to return the favor. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the wall of text ~ I\u2019m just so happy he\u2019s in my life and I don\u2019t know how far off I\u2019d be right now if it wasn\u2019t for him.
