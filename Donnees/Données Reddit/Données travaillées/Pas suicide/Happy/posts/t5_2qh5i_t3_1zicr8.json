I got hit on today after 5 years by a pretty girl, me and this girl flirted a lot. Here is the story. \n\nI am a collage student and Mondays I have a 2 hour gap between classes so I usually just walk around and listen to music, today I went to the student lounge and just sat down and watched tv. My friend came up to me after a few minutes and started doing work and we talked for a bit. Than a pretty girl walked up cuz she knew my friend and she sat down with us, being the friendly guy I am I started talking to her and we quickly got to talking about random stuff like how she skateboards and how I have a funny Irish grandmother. She is a silly girl who ends up handing me her phone with a txt message written in it reads \"do you like me?\" I respond with \"yes your very pretty.\" And we play this game where we are passing her phone back and fourth and I don't bother to ask her number just yet because this is too fun and I feel myself blushing a lot and as a dude I'm not supposed to say I blush but whatever I did and I liked it. She kept looking at me in a cute way and we flirted by her telling me I'm funny and cute and she loves my eyes and how even though I have brown hair my beard is red (cuz I'm Irish) I tell her she is cute and I love her voice. My friend knows we are flirting but he is a champ and just let's us without making anything weird cuz us 3 are still talking but her and I keep passing a phone around. He goes to use the bathroom and she sits next to me and we start talking rather than texting and we end up holding hands and she had super soft hands and we talked for a little bit and as time went on I decided to skip my next class (it's not a major class I just took the class cuz I needed units) us 3 are still there and she and I are playing and she is trying to give me and Indian rope burn and it's funny how gentle she is trying to be while at the same time trying to be mean and I was laughing at her in a joking way and she tried to look at me mean but it just came off cute. We never got each other's numbers but she said Monday and Wednesday she will be at the student center. I know where I'll be while I wait for class.
