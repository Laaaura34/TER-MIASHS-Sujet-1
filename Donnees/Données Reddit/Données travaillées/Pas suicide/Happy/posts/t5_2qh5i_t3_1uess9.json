A few months ago I began my first real job: $110,000/year salary, plus a 10% annual bonus, plus equity in the company worth $220,000 on a 4-year vesting schedule (which I valued at $55,000/year in my head).\n\nSo, $175,000/year, right?  Insane.  My parents are sharecroppers working less than 1,000 acres: I attended rural public schools, community college, then a state university -- $175,000/year is insane money, I felt incredibly fortunate.\n\nBut the true insanity was delivered yesterday, at my first annual performance review: I learned that not only will I get a raise every year (modest; basically a cost of living adjustment) but I get **additional equity every year**, comparable in value to the initial award.\n\nBasically, after 3 years I'll have 4 equity awards all vesting at once -- so what I had calculated as $55,000 per year is more like $220,000 per year.  Now I'm looking at my current earnings as **$350,000/year**.\n\nI don't mean to brag, but *Jesus Christ*.  I don't think I *deserve* this much, my employer is almost certainly over-paying for what they get.  I almost feel guilty, but it's not like I asked for this, they just offered it, so, carpe diem.\n\nI haven't told anyone that I know and I don't plan to, but I just wanted to write this out and share it with someone, hence this throwaway account.  It feels like I've won the lottery.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1uess9/my_job_pays_much_more_than_i_thought/", "title": "My job pays MUCH more than I thought", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "suddenlyuppie", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 423, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1388866649, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1uess9/my_job_pays_much_more_than_i_thought/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440867.7926536, "replies_charged": false}
