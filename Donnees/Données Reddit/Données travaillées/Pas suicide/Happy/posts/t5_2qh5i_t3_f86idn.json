Anyway, these SSHs (that\u2019s what I\u2019ll call them from now on) are all over the school, and include students from all grades, and I\u2019ve made a lot of friends with the other people in my SSH, and there\u2019s even a group chat among most of us in our SSH.\n\nOkay, sorry for that backstory, it was way too long. Can you tell it\u2019s 2:30 AM here? Anyway.\n\nSo ~a week ago I walk in to this SSH and one of the TAs (there are 3 TAs there) jokingly says \u201cOh no, it\u2019s [my name],\u201d and my friend responde with \u201cNo, it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d and it made me feel really good.\n\nI have anxiety, so I constantly feel like I\u2019m saying/doing the wrong thing and that my friends don\u2019t like me, but hearing him say something like that really warms my cold and shriveled heart.\n\nIt just makes me really happy to know my friends (or at least that one friend) feel the same way about me as I do about them.\n\nMy life hasn\u2019t been particularly easy or fun, but this year I think I\u2019m learning from my past mistakes, becoming a better person, and finally starting to get over my depression, and knowing that I have people like that by my side really helps me through my daily struggle.\n\nI applaud you for getting to the end of this, and hopefully everyone reading is/will be as blessed as I am, or even more so.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/f86idn/finally_have_some_good_people_in_my_life/", "title": "Finally have some good people in my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Spudblood", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1582444067, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/f86idn/finally_have_some_good_people_in_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440699.4354217, "replies_charged": false}
