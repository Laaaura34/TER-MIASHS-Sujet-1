My supervisor was upset I resigned so she fired me the next day. She didn't even let me resign on my own terms. My SO got a job in Minneapolis, and I left to follow her. I was fortunate enough to have savings to support myself. However, I was getting depressed and nervous because no one was calling about jobs. I got low. Well, yesterday I got an offer from my first official interview. Not only did they offer me a job, but they offered me 5k more than I asked. So, I have a great job for a great software company with my amazing SO in a wonderful city that supports music and the arts. At 27, I feel happiness for the first time in way too long. I'm gonna work on that. For now, I'm just gonna ride this wave.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/7zgaz4/found_a_new_job_and_i_am_moving_up_north_with_my/", "title": "Found a new job and I am moving up north with my wonderful supportive SO", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "flatasfuck", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1519318197, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7zgaz4/found_a_new_job_and_i_am_moving_up_north_with_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440880.1734793, "replies_charged": false}
