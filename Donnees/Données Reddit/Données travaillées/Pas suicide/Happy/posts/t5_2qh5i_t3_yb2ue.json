I endured all of this awful treatment because I felt like I needed someone else to make me happy and even though I was abused I stayed around because I felt like I was more miserable when I was alone and I needed to feel loved. In addition to this I had a couple of addictions I was battling. Today for the first time I can say that I am happy being alone and I am really self involved, plus I have a pretty good handle on my addictions. The most important part though, I'm happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/yb2ue/today_after_meany_years_of_minor_anxiety_and/", "title": "Today after meany years of minor anxiety and addiction problems, I am happy.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Cwest64", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 53, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1345097235, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/yb2ue/today_after_meany_years_of_minor_anxiety_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438914.3002555, "replies_charged": false}
