My friend, who I don't see very often, was the first person to notice and I was so delighted.  \nThe diet is going strong still and I'm very happy with the lifestyle changes that I've made.  I was never obese, but I've always been a little chubby and definitely over conscious about my weight (I am a male).  \nEdit: I've lost about 10 pounds so far.  I started at 190-185.  I am 5'8.  My goal is 30 more. \n\nEdit #2:  I weighed in this morning at 179!  I haven't been in the 170's since early high school so I feel fantastic.  Once I hit my target, and I will hit it, I will post pictures of the before and after.  I'm doing weekly pictures and weigh ins so we'll see how it goes.
