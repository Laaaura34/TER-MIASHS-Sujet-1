Not a huge deal, but also something you don't want to do constantly. So, once or twice a week, I'd have to gather up all the trash in my house, which I'd procrastinate on until the trash cans were practically overflowing or starting to smell, put on shoes, haul usually 4-5 trash bags and assorted boxes to the car, then drive over and unload.\n\nNow, at my house, when a can is full, I can just take that one bag, carry it to my garage, and toss it in the bigger can. Or, if I have a box or something to large for the indoor can, just carry it over to the garage and toss it in. Also, I can finally recycle, which I've never been able to do (without a herculean amount of effort of hauling it a not insignificant distance to the recycling center myself).\n\nSure, I have to haul it to the curb once a week, but that's a small price to pay.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/q8cuei/bought_my_first_house_favorite_thing_being_able/", "title": "Bought my first house.
