I\u2019ve been homeless and in and out of the hospital since. Life has been one huge struggle. I had no way to make money because I worked from home with a home business. Yesterday I found out I got the job of my dreams doing what I love. It pays a real salary and has benefits! My boss is cool as hell! Had he not done that I probably would have never applied for this job. So honestly Thankyou ex for forcing me to change my life. It wasn\u2019t easy, but Im gonna be a better person for it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/qe3zrg/i_got_kicked_out_by_my_ex_around_4_months_ago/", "title": "I got kicked out by my ex around 4 months ago\u2026.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LittlePurplePandaa", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 90, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634992136, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/qe3zrg/i_got_kicked_out_by_my_ex_around_4_months_ago/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440563.2230074, "replies_charged": false}
