I was working only on contracts (which they would extend as my time ran up), but as soon as it was time to make the decision to bring me on permanent or not they let me go.  All of my supervisors tried their hardest to keep me, but it was my supervisor's boss (who had never met me once) that made the call that \"it wasn't in the budget.\"  I could never land a full time job in my field since then (though a few very short term contracts came my way) and I'm almost broke.  After a long wait I will be returning to work with a $3/hour raise :)\n\nI'm ecstatic and wanted to share.  My career/life outlook has always been brightened by reading the posts about people pulling themselves out of debt, landing new/better jobs, etc. so I hope this can return the favor to a few people.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/lnirg/im_getting_my_job_back_with_a_pay_raise/", "title": "I'm getting my job back - with a pay raise!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Bizzock", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 53, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1319488505, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lnirg/im_getting_my_job_back_with_a_pay_raise/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440769.8106327, "replies_charged": false}
