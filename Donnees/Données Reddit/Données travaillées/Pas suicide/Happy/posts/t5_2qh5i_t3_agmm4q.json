But apparently when she went to leave, my little niece, about two, said, \u201cTell Lexi bye?\u201d several times. She didn\u2019t want to leave without saying goodbye to me. My parents let me know and I came out of my room to see her. She said \u201cbye bye Lexi!\u201d And when I told her I love her she said it back! For the first time ever!\n\n\nI have so much to be thankful for. That moment was a moment of pure bliss. I\u2019ve loved my niece since before she was born, and now she\u2019s starting to understand that and reciprocate. Life is good y\u2019all. Now I just have to wait on the other, littlest niece to understand my love as well :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/agmm4q/my_little_niece_told_me_that_she_loves_me_back/", "title": "My little niece told me that she loves me back!
