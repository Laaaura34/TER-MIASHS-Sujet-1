I've become accustomed to waking up a few times in the middle of every night, and oftentimes waking up extremely early (anywhere between 2:30-4:30am) with my mind racing, being unable to fall back asleep at all, so I just start my day. And without fail, no matter when I wake up, I feel like absolute garbage and it takes a while for me to feel normal (let alone excited about my day).\n\nBut this morning... I don't know what it is! I went to bed around 9pm and woke up right at 6am and I have an incredible amount of energy. I didn't wake up AT ALL and didn't feel glued to my bed. It's the most perfect night of sleep I've ever had.\n\nNow I'm just trying to figure out everything I did to make this happen... it was pretty cool, so that helped. I had a normal, nutritious dinner about 3 hours before going to sleep. I still had a good amount of screentime before bed, but nothing insanely stimulating/distracting.\n\nI don't know, I'm just so excited about this and had to tell someone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/geh9ki/for_the_very_first_time_in_years_i_just_woke_up/", "title": "For the very first time in years, I just woke up from an uninterrupted full night's sleep actually feeling well-rested and energized right out of bed.
