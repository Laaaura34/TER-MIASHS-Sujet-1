I told someone from VR that I had a crush on them and they said it was mutual. We met up for a couple dates so far and she's amazing. I feel incredibly comfortable with her which is huge for me. In fact I don't think I've ever felt more comfortable with another person. She's smart, caring, and so fucking sexy. I'm also kind of freaking out at the idea that I might drive her away. But I'm optimistic to the point that it's annoying my friends. I wish everyone could find someone as awesome as she is.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/f7aeqi/i_told_a_crush_from_vr_how_i_felt_and_we_met_in/", "title": "I told a crush from VR how I felt and we met in real life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "damontoo", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1582288099, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/f7aeqi/i_told_a_crush_from_vr_how_i_felt_and_we_met_in/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441984.7230525, "replies_charged": false}
