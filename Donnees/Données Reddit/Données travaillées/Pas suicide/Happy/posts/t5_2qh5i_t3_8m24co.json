We usually get dogs come to visit us which makes me very happy but today I just got a very special guest- a ball python! Her owner came into the store today with her curled up around her wrist like a bracelet. I\u2019ve never met a snake before, so I was so in awe! She was very happy to answer questions I had about her (usually they\u2019re the one asking me questions ahaha!). She even let me hold her! I didn\u2019t get the courage to ask if I could take a picture but I told her to bring her in next time she comes! I am in love with this little girl! She curled up around my hands and it was the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever experienced, she stuck her tongue out at me too! I was way too excited to not share", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/8m24co/just_started_working_at_a_pet_supply_store_2/", "title": "Just started working at a pet supply store 2 weeks ago and today I got the privilege of meeting and holding my first snake- the sweetest ball python!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ArcticMirage", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1527258092, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8m24co/just_started_working_at_a_pet_supply_store_2/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442436.9566944, "replies_charged": false}
