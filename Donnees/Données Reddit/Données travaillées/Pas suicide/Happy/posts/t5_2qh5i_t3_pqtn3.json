She's not the most beautiful girl in town.  She's not the smartest girl in town.  But she's so nice to me.  That's all I want.  Just someone who is nice to me and giving without expecting anything in return.  We've been together close to five months and she still gets my heart pounding when we kiss, or even just hold hands.  I'm not afraid to lose her.  I'll be sad if I do.  There are others like her out there, but not a lot of them.  Someone who comes from a similar background and upbringing.  Someone who shares many interests with me, but not everything.  Someone who keeps and maintains pleasant friends.  I want to tell her that I love her.  But not yet.  I've been jaded about girls and relationships for the past 15 years.  Something is different.  Maybe it's the post-Valentine's Day glow, but I don't think it's just that.  I'm just so happy right now and wanted to share.
