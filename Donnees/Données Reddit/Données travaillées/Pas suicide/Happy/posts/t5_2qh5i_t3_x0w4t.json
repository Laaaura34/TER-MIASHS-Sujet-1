Being young, brash, and full of ego, I was enamoured by the build fast, sell high mentality.  I didn't care about the blood equity - I just loved building things.  Fast forward three years, and I found myself in a very unhappy spot.  My bills remained pretty much the same as when I dove in, but due to one excuse or another, I was stuck with working an engineer's job for minimum wage.  Not cool.  \n\nJust recently, I've been approached by a rather large and affluent fortune 500 esque company seeking to harvest my talent, and I've never been happier.  The pay's great, the benefits start day one, and I'm going to be in a good spot within a few sparse months to buy my first drift car shell (I'm the admin for /r/drifting, and don't even own a slidemobile... lol) and get to wrenching.
