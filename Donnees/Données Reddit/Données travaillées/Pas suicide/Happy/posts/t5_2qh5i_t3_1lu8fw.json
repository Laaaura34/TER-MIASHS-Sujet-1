I've always had some difficulty making and keeping friends, and school puts me very far from the two closest pals I had. That being said-- last year, I had a pretty rough time thanks to some prickly romances and one semester's worth of an insane roommate...\n\nSo, this year, the fact that my housemates like me has me confused and delighted. I had put myself forth honestly and without expectations of being accepted, and through this tactic, I've made friends. My roommate treats me like a newly-added sister, and the one guy downstairs keeps having heart-to-hearts with me. I even got a goodnight kiss on the head out of it! :3\n\nInstead of summarizing my feelings with adjectives, I'd like to think of my cat when she cuddles next to me and falls asleep, purring. I feel like I'm the cat and this house is my snuggly companion.
