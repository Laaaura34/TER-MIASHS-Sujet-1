Really wanted some delivery food. There's a place by my house and I LOVE their cannolis so I carefully met the $10 minimum and placed an order for 8pc chicken nuggets, a soda, and two cannoli.\n\nDude must know I'm hurting because he comes early and hands me a larger bag than I'm expecting. \n\nMy 8pc chicken nuggets is actually a 10pc, overflowing with fries. They threw in a few containers of honey mustard (my favorite, but I forgot to put it in the notes on the order). And an extra cannoli. \n\nI feel loved in the weirdest way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/568ig2/an_anecdote_about_why_being_a_goodtipping_regular/", "title": "An anecdote about why being a good-tipping regular customer has its perks", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "feminotthrow", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 529, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1475797849, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/568ig2/an_anecdote_about_why_being_a_goodtipping_regular/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442129.7007089, "replies_charged": false}
