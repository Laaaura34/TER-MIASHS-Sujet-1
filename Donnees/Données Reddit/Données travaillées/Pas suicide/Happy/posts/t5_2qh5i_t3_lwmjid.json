We have been married for 9 1/2 years. I still look at this woman every day and don\u2019t ever want to take my eyes off of her. I love the lines and curves of her face and smile, the shape of her eyebrows and her dimples, everything\u2026 I just feel so in love. I\u2019m always in love but tonight I\u2019m not taking it for granted, I guess. I\u2019m happy I can do my part to support her and to be here for our kids. \n\nI love our family. Our children, our cats and our dog, the home and life we have made. \n\nI have so much to be grateful for and tonight I can feel it. It\u2019s not to say that I am not always aware, but tonight something just feels\u2026 More magical? I love her, I know she loves me, we have a good life. I just want to rave about it.
