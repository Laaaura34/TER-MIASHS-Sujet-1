I was in another city far from home waiting in traffic at an intersection. I noticed this cute girl behind me in an suv. Shes doing her hair and dancing and stuff. I was like dang this girl is cute. We get going and it opens up to two lanes. She starts racing me! I was like hell no. I blew by her and waved. She blew by me again. I went by again and pretended to paddle a canoe. We get to the highway where it opens up to 2 lanes again. I pulled up a big number sign on my phone and held it to the window. I tried to get her to sign her number or write it down or something. That didn't work. So I said ok just follow me. We ended up pulling over and introduced ourselves. I got her number. Said goodbye. I went and got gas. Got back on the highway and met back up with her! I text her and asked if she had time to grab a quick bite. Ended up going to Dairy Queen and talking. We have a ton in common, shes really easy to talk to. Not once did I feel like I have to choose my words carefully. Come to find out she actually lives pretty close to where i live! We're hanging out next week!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/humpig/met_a_girl_on_my_way_back_from_a_road_trip/", "title": "Met a girl on my way back from a road trip", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BaconBoss1", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595257059, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/humpig/met_a_girl_on_my_way_back_from_a_road_trip/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440606.7708137, "replies_charged": false}
