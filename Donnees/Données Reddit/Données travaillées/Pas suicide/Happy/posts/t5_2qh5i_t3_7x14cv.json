As someone who has lived in the northeast of the U.S. my whole life, winters have always been a drag. I'm pretty sure I get SAD (seasonal affective disorder) every winter, but this year has been particularly good.\n\nWhen I think about spring and summer, I think about all the the fun things I'm going to do and how even waking up in the morning makes me excited for the day. I'm always so productive and motivated during those months.\n\nI'm wondering, is this because I'm rebounding from the winter lows? Does months of shitty weather just make me appreciate the nicer weather more? If I lived in a nicer place, would I take my sunny warm days for granted? Or do those of you that live in nice places feel that way every day?\n\nThanks and I hope you all have a nice day!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/7x14cv/hey_rhappy_do_any_of_you_that_live_in_a_warmer/", "title": "Hey, /r/happy!
