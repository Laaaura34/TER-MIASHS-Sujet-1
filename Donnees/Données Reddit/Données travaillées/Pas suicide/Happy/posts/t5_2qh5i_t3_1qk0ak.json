He is so strong, so burly and sexy and manly and I can't get enough of him. I'm convinced he's some type of sex god. He knows exactly what I want. I'm seriously left speechless every time. \n\nHe's helpful and loving and affectionate. He's sweet and reassuring. He holds my hand and drives me to work when I'm running late and need to do my makeup in the car. When I need to be a crazy person he doesn't hold it against me and I am so happy I get to wake up next to him every day. I'm so fortunate that I get to marry my best friend and come home to someone who will eat my food AND help me with the dishes before diving into a Netflix marathon.\n\n I love him so much. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1qk0ak/patience_finally_paid_off/", "title": "Patience finally paid off!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "spareows", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1384370544, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1qk0ak/patience_finally_paid_off/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440881.2359564, "replies_charged": false}
