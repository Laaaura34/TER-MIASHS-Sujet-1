I used to love love love reading, but with school and work and life, I rarely had time to pick up a book. So on January 2, 2019, I signed up for a library card. At that time, my library had a thing where you could set a goal for how many books you wanted to read (similar to goodreads challenge).  I set my goal for 40 books for the entire year. As of yesterday, I have read/or listened to 89 books this year!!! I kind of want to just pick up something quick to make it an even 90 before the year officially ends, but overall I feel so accomplished and happy!!  \n\nMy new 2020 resolution is to declutter my house.  So.  We shall see how that goes! \n\nHappy New Years everyone!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/eh8her/successfully_completed_my_2019_resolution/", "title": "Successfully completed my 2019 resolution!!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AuDBall8441", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 26, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1577639894, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/eh8her/successfully_completed_my_2019_resolution/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442651.029603, "replies_charged": false}
