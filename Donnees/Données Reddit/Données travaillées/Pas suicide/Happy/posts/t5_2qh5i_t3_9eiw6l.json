We got along great, talked for hours, to me, we made all kinds of sense. She didn\u2019t feel the same way. But we remained great friends. There were some times when life and other relationships got in the way, where we lost touch a little, but whenever we\u2019d reconnect, it was always like we just saw each other the day before. \n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve dated a few other women that were wrong for me, she dated a few men that were wrong for her. Much misery for both of us.\n\nBut we\u2019re together now, only a month, but I\u2019ve never been happier, I\u2019ve never been more optimistic, I feel like Ron Burgundy but I have neither a mountain nor a TV camera to shout my love from, so reddit it is... I hope this is the right sub for me to emote all over... I\u2019m just really happy! \n\nI\u2019m going to marry this woman.
