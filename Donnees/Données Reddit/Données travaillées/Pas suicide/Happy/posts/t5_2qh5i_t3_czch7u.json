We were lying in bed talking away about our days and different things. Somehow I ended up talking about a very traumatic time in my life, which I have done before with him and he knows a lot about it, but this time for some reason it sent me into a panic attack.\n\nAnd boy, was it a doozey of a one! It lasted about 20 mins and it was one where I couldn't talk at all and just curled up in a ball feeling like death was seconds away and he was amazing guys! He sat by me, spoke calmly to me, kept telling me to breathe and just being amazing overall! When it was all done and over with he pulled me into a big bear hug and giving me a kiss on the forehead he told me how much he loved me.\nIt made me feel so much better! I know I'll be a bit jittery for a little while after it but if it wasn't for him, it would have been so much worse!\n\nIt's been a weird and hard summer but in the end I'm so so happy to have this man in my life! I've had a bad relationships in the past where a situation like this would have been a very different experience, I'm so lucky to have him!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/czch7u/my_boyfriend_helped_me_through_a_bad_panic_attack/", "title": "My boyfriend helped me through a bad panic attack", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "justanothergirl1951", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 27, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1567552302, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/czch7u/my_boyfriend_helped_me_through_a_bad_panic_attack/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439353.680193, "replies_charged": false}
