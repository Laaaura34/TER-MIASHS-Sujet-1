He\u2019s worked his whole life for tomorrow. He rarely took off sick. He always gave/ gives it his all. And always goes above and beyond in his job. He never stops ceasing to learn to better himself. This is the first time he won\u2019t be more than 45 minutes away. Or the first time we won\u2019t see each other often. He\u2019s moving over 700 miles away and a car trip of 12 hours. He\u2019s kind of anxious about being away from his family for the first time but he\u2019s got a new amazing job. A brand new home with his awesome wife. And family he gets to know and love more. Everything he\u2019s worked for 14 years. He achieved. Although he\u2019s afraid he should be very proud of himself because I couldn\u2019t do even an iota of what he did. How he does do it is beyond me. He\u2019s helped me, he\u2019s taught me, and I\u2019m so incredibly proud to be his little sister. I\u2019ll miss you! But it\u2019s only very temporary lol! We will be short behind him in a year and some but it will fly by. So even though we\u2019re sad that we won\u2019t see him everyday. He knows we\u2019re a phone call, a face time, a plane ride or road trip away. \n\nEnjoy the benefits of how hard you worked and don\u2019t be scared of shit. Own it. Both of you! \u2764\ufe0f I love you!\n\n-C", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fa5vx0/my_brothers_moving_out_but_im_very_happy_for_him/", "title": "My brothers moving out but I\u2019m very happy for him.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Cassieelouu32", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1582774466, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/fa5vx0/my_brothers_moving_out_but_im_very_happy_for_him/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442648.485305, "replies_charged": false}
