At my next job, I had consistent customer service awards, great stats, and was generally amazing at my job - I went for a management position and was denied. A few jobs later and a few years wiser, I began a job in a call center and worked my way up from bottom run employee, to tech, to advanced tech, and finally began taking supervisor calls and helping with advanced technical issues. I was damn good at my job, but was denied a management position and any sort of financial compensation. I transferred to another department. \n\nFinally, in my new department, I have worked my ass off and done whatever I could to improve my environment for myself and for my fellow employees - today, I was brought into a conference room and told that I will be leading my own team, starting tomorrow, finally getting taking the step from regular employee to middle management, and hopefully higher. I'm extremely excited, and at 25 this is a milestone in my career.
