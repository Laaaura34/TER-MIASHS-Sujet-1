I started treatment nearly 3 years ago after I was hospitalized and since then I've tried to make things better for myself.\n\nI was fired from my job in January, which again set me back. I was also apprehensive about the future, unsure if I could get a job in my field with just a bachelor's degree and no experience, especially in this economy.\n\nBut I started sending out applications last week, and I got a call from one company. My interview was yesterday and they decided to hire me.\n\nI'm just hoping things keep looking up from here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/bvc57/dear_reddit_i_just_turned_21_today_i_graduate/", "title": "Dear reddit: I just turned 21 today, I graduate college in a few weeks, and I just got hired in a job related to my field.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "farewellkitty", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 77, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1272065051, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bvc57/dear_reddit_i_just_turned_21_today_i_graduate/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442879.8151174, "replies_charged": false}
