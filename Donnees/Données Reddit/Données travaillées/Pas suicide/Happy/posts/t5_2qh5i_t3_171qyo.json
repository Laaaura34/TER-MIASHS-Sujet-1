We were getting pretty low on food, so my mom somehow managed to give me $4 to buy bread. I went to the closest grocery store, and it was closed. I went to another one on the other side of town, and it was closed too. However there was a big semi delivering goods. As I'm walking away from the closed doors, the truck guy asks me what I was looking for. I tell Jim bread, but unfortunately the place is closes. He asked me what type, and I told him whatever was the cheapest. He then asked me what my favorite bread was, and I told him 12-grain (I'm somewhat of a health freak) he went to the truck and got me not one, but two packs of bread, and wouldn't take the money.
