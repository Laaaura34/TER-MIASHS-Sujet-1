I've always been the kind of person who cries after a frustrating phone call or when people raise their voice at me. \n\nToday I got into a very frustrating and aggressive argument with my ex.  Instead of getting so overwhelmed that I breakdown I kept my calm and politely asked that we continue the conversation another time as we were both too heated to be productive. My request wasn't well received but I stood my ground, stayed calm, and maintained my request. In that moment I saw myself as the person I always wanted to be! I'm almost in tears writing this but they are happy tears! Life feels good right now, I'm proud of me. \n\nThank you for reading everyone, I hope we all find the inner peace to weather rough storms :) Stay safe.
