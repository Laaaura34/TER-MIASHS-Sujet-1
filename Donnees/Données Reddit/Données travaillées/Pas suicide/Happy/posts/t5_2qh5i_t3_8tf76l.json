I've had a rough patch at my first year of University where I didn't have any real friends. A lot of people taking advantage of me and flaking on me. I thought for a long while that I would never really fit in. This summer I traveled all the way across the US for an internship. After three weeks I was invited by someone I met at work to spend the day with a group of their friends. I had never met them before but I instantly connected with them! It may not have seemed like much for them, just walking around downtown and eating out, but for me it meant the world and I have so much more optimism for the future that I will find more genuinely kind, smart, and funny people like them. Thank you friend for inviting me out with your friends. You didn't have to do it and it means the world to me that you did. I couldn't be happier right now :)\n\nTLDR: A friendly invitation goes a long way :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/8tf76l/after_a_year_of_feeling_alone_i_finally_made_some/", "title": "After a year of feeling alone, I finally made some friends thanks to the kindness of someone I met at work :)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ScottishGrunt", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1529811478, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8tf76l/after_a_year_of_feeling_alone_i_finally_made_some/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438912.8675873, "replies_charged": false}
