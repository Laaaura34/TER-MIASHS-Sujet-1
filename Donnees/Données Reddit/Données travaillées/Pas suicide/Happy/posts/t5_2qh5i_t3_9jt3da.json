The position involves me leaving my current team who I've grown to adore dearly and start over with a new one. \n\nToday was my last full day in my current position. I've been really nervous and stressed as well as excited about it and I've been voicing that a bit. Today, everyone in my office chipped in to buy my favorite pizza, a cake, and a money tree (for the record, a money tree is a plant that's supposed to send good vibes and prosperity the other person's way. i didn't know what it was until today so i thought i'd add this little note in) as a final gift for my leaving. They all wrote a nice leaving message on the pot the plant came in, added some inside jokes, and made my sentimental self smile all day. \n\nProbably a small effort on their part but I thought I'd share something nice that happened to me today. Cheers! :) ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/9jt3da/i_got_a_money_tree_and_ive_never_been_so_happy_to/", "title": "I got a Money Tree and I've never been so happy to get a plant", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "loveelusive", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1538188151, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9jt3da/i_got_a_money_tree_and_ive_never_been_so_happy_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442453.300398, "replies_charged": false}
