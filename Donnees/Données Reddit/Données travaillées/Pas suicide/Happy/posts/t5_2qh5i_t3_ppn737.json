Like many in this group, mental health, & it\u2019s consequences hit very close to home for me. Due to spending a lot of time in hospital recently I\u2019ve got really into sending happy mail & penpalling! It\u2019s a great way for me to kill time and make new friends, it\u2019s healthy to vent (with respecting boundaries of course!)\ud83d\udc95\n\nMy happy mail usually includes an encouraging letter, stickers, mental health worksheets & positive quotes. It\u2019s completely free and writing back/responding is optional. I thought it might help & comfort some of you in this group, or even just give you a bit of a pick-me up if you\u2019re having a bad day\ud83c\udf38. \n\nIf you are interested in receiving some positive post, or becoming penpals to support each other, don\u2019t hesitate to message me. Stay safe.\ud83e\udd0d\n\nPeace,\nIndie\ud83e\uddda\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ppn737/free_happy_mail_positive_post_to_whoever_needs_it/", "title": "FREE HAPPY MAIL / POSITIVE POST TO WHOEVER NEEDS IT\ud83d\udc0c\ud83d\udcee", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Xoxosaskiaaaxoxo", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631829789, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ppn737/free_happy_mail_positive_post_to_whoever_needs_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439583.6930957, "replies_charged": false}
