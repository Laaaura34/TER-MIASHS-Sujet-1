Nothing but suspicions, pain and complete heartbreak, but I couldn't leave. It ended a couple months ago and I haven't been happier. I'm more optimistic and outgoing than I ever was, but most importantly I didn't let such a terrible experience make me a bitter person. I feel like a more caring person for it actually. I've found someone who I don't have to pretend to be something I'm not with. My usually bad jokes, lame interests and awkward personality are all the things she likes about me. I've never felt more appreciated or confident.\n\nSome things are meant to end for a reason. Some times fighting for it isn't the right answer.
