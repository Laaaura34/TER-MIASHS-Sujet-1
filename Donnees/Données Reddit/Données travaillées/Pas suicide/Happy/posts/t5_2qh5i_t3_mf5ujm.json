I am 20 years old and recently started pursuing content writing professionally. I gathered enough money in around 2 months to get gifts for my loved ones. \n\nI bought my mom and dad clothing and my brother a watch. For my boyfriend I got him a phone case and a notebook. \n\n To do this for my family means so much for me. My mom and dad never bought gifts for themselves. Only the things which were absolutely needed were bought. To get them gifts feel so good. They deserve it and so much more. Even for my boyfriend. I always wanted to buy him gifts frequently but never had the money and now I do ! \n\nI hope these were the first of many gifts. I feel happy and very emotional today haha.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mf5ujm/i_bought_my_mom_dad_brother_and_my_boyfriend/", "title": "I bought my mom, dad, brother and my boyfriend gifts from my first ever paycheck", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sillysanjana", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 73, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616953635, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mf5ujm/i_bought_my_mom_dad_brother_and_my_boyfriend/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441120.6316295, "replies_charged": false}
