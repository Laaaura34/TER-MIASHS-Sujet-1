As cliche as it is he really is my best friend. We've been giggling like idiots the whole time and we both want this more than anything. This is the dude that plays Disney music for a sing a long when I get ready to go out, eats disgusting amounts of nacho cheese with me, and loves me more than I love myself.  Just can't get enough of this guy (which is good because we're roomies now!) I never thought I would have a relationship this awesome. We laugh our asses off daily and take care of each other as people. Love like this feels surreal and at the same time the most genuine thing I've ever experienced. Total bliss. Had to get it out, I'm grinning like a fool at work just thinking about it. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/2q2rob/my_boyfriend_moved_in_this_weekend/", "title": "My boyfriend moved in this weekend...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tree_hugs_", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 55, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1419263436, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2q2rob/my_boyfriend_moved_in_this_weekend/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439205.9991157, "replies_charged": false}
