I was there with my wife 2 teenage daughters and matching female friends. I was naturally out of any conversations so I glanced through my phone and I saw the Roku had a google cast option show up on my phone. They were currently showing MMA bullshit on a busy Sunday afternoon. So just to see if I could I cast my favorite internet cat, Maru to the Roku (that had the sound turned down)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRVruzlQF5cqpw9jQgIgNdw\n Nobody noticed for a good 30 seconds and then only the kids, I saw one little guy nudge another and it seemed to spread through all of the youngsters. I actually had my back to the tv but could see most of the restaurant. Within 5 minuites the whole place had changed from a madhouse into a fun, chuckle full, chatting, happy place. The servers noticed and were totally confused, but couldn't seem to find the remote(or work it out).\nAnyway it made me happy that the only hacking I've ever done seemed to calm things down.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/7hawdz/the_time_i_calmed_down_a_restaurant/", "title": "The time I calmed down a restaurant", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "alivin", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1512321892, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7hawdz/the_time_i_calmed_down_a_restaurant/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439316.353387, "replies_charged": false}
