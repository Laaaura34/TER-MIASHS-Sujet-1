I consider myself to be a person who normally looks on the brightside of things or at least encourages positivity. About an hour ago I was thinking about that, decided to search to see if there was an /r/optimism -- turns out there was! Not that populated though, I glance at the sidebar and see the top link is to /r/happy. I've pretty much spent the past 45 minutes or so reading just events or people's gratefulness and it's given me this indescribable bliss! So please all of you, keep sharing stories, they're inspiring and uplifting and a great way to spread the way you're feeling to someone else :)\n\n\nEDIT: DHWJAFZOHDGW wow my reddit gold cherry has been popped thank you so much kind stranger, you've made my own happiness make me even happier if that makes sense. <3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/2pb9b1/happy_because_of_this_subreddit/", "title": "Happy because of this subreddit", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "faxwater", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1418605529, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2pb9b1/happy_because_of_this_subreddit/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439218.3335807, "replies_charged": false}
