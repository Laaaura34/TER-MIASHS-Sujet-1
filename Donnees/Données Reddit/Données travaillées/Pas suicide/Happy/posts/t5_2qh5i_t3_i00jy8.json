I'm a grad student studying entomology and doing field work in the Appalachians. This afternoon I had a great conversation about how cool insects are with a small group of hikers from Tennessee. One of them said she was a beekeeper! After, as they were walking away, she half yelled \"Are you single?!\" just barely loud enough for me to hear it! I didn't process it fast enough to say anything before they were out of earshot, but it was still charming. I recently got out of a relationship (the kind that makes you want to give up dating), so it was funny and a nice confidence boost. So to her, thank you for making me smile for the rest of the day!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/i00jy8/i_met_a_nice_beekeeper_from_tennessee_while_hiking/", "title": "I met a nice beekeeper from Tennessee while hiking", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tullymonsterfrog", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596028701, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/i00jy8/i_met_a_nice_beekeeper_from_tennessee_while_hiking/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439383.2990716, "replies_charged": false}
