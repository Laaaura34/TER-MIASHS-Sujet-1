I was facing unemployment as my current part time contract came to a close. \nI was facing having to risk working in grocery stores even though the person I live with has a compromised immune system. \nI had an interview a few weeks ago for a job that\u2019s not exactly in my field but there\u2019s a lot of crossover and it\u2019s great experience, but was told they weren\u2019t going to hire anyone until the quarantine was over. \n\nI got the call yesterday that I got the job and they wanted me to start working remotely Monday because they realized this wasn\u2019t ending any time soon. \n\nI\u2019m feeling so relieved and lucky to have found secured and unionized employment. I haven\u2019t really told anyone because a number of my friends have lost their jobs and are struggling to find jobs and make ends meet so I don\u2019t want to come off as if I\u2019m bragging. I\u2019m just feeling really blessed and am filled with happy tears.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/g6x2y9/relieved_and_feeling_blessed_to_have_been_able_to/", "title": "relieved and feeling blessed to have been able to find employment during these hard times", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "notsodumbdumbcane", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1587683226, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/g6x2y9/relieved_and_feeling_blessed_to_have_been_able_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439157.2005804, "replies_charged": false}
