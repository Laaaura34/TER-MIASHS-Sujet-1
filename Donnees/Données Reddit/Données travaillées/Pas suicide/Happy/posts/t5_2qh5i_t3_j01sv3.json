We've been separated for more than half a year because of corona, and what's kept us going has been the thought of finally getting to hold each other again and start building our life together. But there's always been this looming uncertainty - what if we make it through this time of separation, but when we finally get to be together, he'll have to go too soon? It's been a crushing reality to live in... dreaming of a long, happy future with him but not even knowing if we'll get that far.\n\nA few days ago, he went to see the doctor without me knowing - he said it was a dermatologist's appointment. He wanted to wait until he knew what the results of the tests were before telling me. And boy, they were so much better than we could've expected... he was told that since the previous tests a few months ago there's been incredible recovery taking place, and that he should be pretty much fully recovered in another 6 months. He was told that there's most likely going to be nothing stopping him from living a long, fulfilling life.\n\nIt feels surreal... suddenly not having to worry anymore. Knowing that it's all up to us now. It's crazy, and I'm feeling incredibly grateful.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/j01sv3/my_partner_was_told_by_his_doctor_that_he_is/", "title": "My partner was told by his doctor that he is quickly recovering from a disease that was supposed to be fatal.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "flcks", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 26, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601105876, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/j01sv3/my_partner_was_told_by_his_doctor_that_he_is/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440970.5951412, "replies_charged": false}
