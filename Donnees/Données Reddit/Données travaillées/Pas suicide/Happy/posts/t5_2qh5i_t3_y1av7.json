I never wanted a white dress (but I bought one because our family convinced me that I'd regret it if I didn't). We never wanted to bother with centerpieces, place settings, favors, invitations, seat covers, caterers or photographers. We never wanted a traditional wedding.\n\nSo as we're going about the planning process, we started to realize that we'd never get to do a wedding our way, so fuck it! We're eloping. We called a marriage commissioner last week, set a time, got some friends to witness, and as of this afternoon, we're married! This way, we get to just throw a party and not have to deal with all the frills.\n\nIt was perfect. We had our tiny ceremony with a wonderful marriage commissioner, went to the pub with our friends who witnessed for it and had burgers and beers, then went home and watched justice league cartoons with wine and snuggled with the dog. \n\nI'm so fucking excited. After 7 years together, I finally get to call this wonderful man my husband. \n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/y1av7/i_have_a_husband/", "title": "I have a husband!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jadebear", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1344661288, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/y1av7/i_have_a_husband/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440772.1656914, "replies_charged": false}
