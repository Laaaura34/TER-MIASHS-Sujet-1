They said that there would be a test to see how well I could follow a \u201cskew\u201d (not sure how to spell it) and I\u2019ve never done that before. So, I was nervous. But I turned out to be really good at it! They said they\u2019d call if they were interested and that made me even more nervous because all of the restaurant jobs I\u2019ve interviewed for are so fast like \u201cyou\u2019ll start tomorrow and make this much here\u2019s your apron\u201d. But no, I gotta wait for a call. I went to the mall to look at clothes I could wear to this job since I\u2019ve never had a job with no uniform before and while I was shopping I got a call saying i got the job. Literally 2 hours later \u263a\ufe0f\n\nI know it seems like an odd thing but I have such a thing for unboxing and I love the idea of being a part of that experience for someone. Also, I have set hours! I was starting to think the old 9-5 didn\u2019t exist anymore. I don\u2019t know any places that shut down on weekends! This is gonna be so much better for my work life balance than being a kitchen manager!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/9bm2kn/just_started_my_very_first_mondayfriday_job_ever/", "title": "Just started my very first Monday-Friday job ever!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JapaneseStudentHaru", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1535652804, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9bm2kn/just_started_my_very_first_mondayfriday_job_ever/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438955.7926311, "replies_charged": false}
