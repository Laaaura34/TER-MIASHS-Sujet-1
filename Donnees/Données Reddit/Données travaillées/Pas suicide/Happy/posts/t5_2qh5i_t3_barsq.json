I've never trained for the event by running only by playing hockey 3 days a week and hitting the gym twice a week using a recumbent bike. The race was for charity so I was able to contribute $25 to a good cause, signing up as a 'fun run'. But then I changed my mind. I figured what the heck, extra five bucks won't hurt. I ran with a time of 26:34 and came in second place for my age range only trailing by 11 seconds! I was given a silver medal and it made my day! \n\nOn the way home I saw a small display stand near a gas station where a couple were selling Bonsai trees. I had been thinking about purchasing a Bonsai before, but didn't have the time to stop. Fortunately I was able to stop, ask questions and learn about how to care for these awesome trees. I ended up buying a 6 year old Juniper that came with a small figurine of a turtle. I tipped the older gal and thanked her for the help and she gave me another figurine of an old man fishing with a small ivory fish at the end of the line!! :)\n\nEdit:\nHere's my [Bonsai tree](http://imgur.com/gKRnH)    :))  With a picture of Johnny Cash on the wall as a bonus.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/barsq/ran_my_first_5k_and_i_bought_a_bonsai_tree/", "title": "Ran my first 5K, and I bought a bonsai tree :)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "microburst", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 84, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1268072707, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/barsq/ran_my_first_5k_and_i_bought_a_bonsai_tree/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440880.7902505, "replies_charged": false}
