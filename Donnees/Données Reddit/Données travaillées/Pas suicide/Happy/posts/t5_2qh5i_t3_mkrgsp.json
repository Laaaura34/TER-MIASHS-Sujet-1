I love bringing joy to people. I also love being around friends and not having to leave my home. My MIL (mother in law) normally hosts events, but I hosted Easter with my hubs family yesterday. My MIL is also extremely OCD and a germaphobe. We have a good relationship though (we are very different people though.. her idea of camping is staying in a fully furnished cabin while mine is in a hammock under the stars. She likes glam/modern I like rustic..think chip and Joanne gains.. I live on a small farm while she freaks out at the thought of poop). \n\nWe were all sitting around and idk how it came up but I said I'd like to turn the farm into a wedding venue one day and I even came up with a name \"Oak Grove Farms\" or \"the original OG\" cue chuckles. Apparently MIL didn't know what OG meant so my SIL explained it to her. MIL then said \"oh my goodness, you are not a gangster if anything you're more like Martha Stuart.\" \n\nY'all I don't achieve to be like Martha Stuart, but my MIL is one of the hardest people to please when it comes to hosting and that was seriously the best compliment she could have ever given me. Of course we then went into the conversation that Martha Stuart and snoop dog are friends and only one of them is a convicted felon but hey. I'm still happy and beaming from that.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mkrgsp/my_mother_in_law_compared_me_to_martha_stuart/", "title": "My mother in law compared me to Martha Stuart", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "subbratkinky", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 17, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617647539, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mkrgsp/my_mother_in_law_compared_me_to_martha_stuart/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438986.0651734, "replies_charged": false}
