I went on my first date ever and it was blissful. I was with the guy who I've been friends with for two years and have liked just as long, and he let me set the pace of the night (important because I have social anxiety).\n\nI got home really late but still haven't gotten any trouble for it.\n\nI BSed a project for an online course that I thought would surely screw my grade over, but my teacher loved it and thought it showed greater knowledge than what I was learning in the course. \n\nAnd now it's an off day from work, a beautiful summer day, and I am at peace.\n\nI'm waiting for something to come crashing down on me, but in this moment I am truly happy.\n\nI'm so glad there is a place to share these things.
