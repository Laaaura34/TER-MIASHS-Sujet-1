I was told that he might not survive on two separate occasions: once when he was admitted and again when he had to be transferred to specialist hospital because the ventilator just wasn't enough to keep his oxygen up. But yesterday, he was transferred to the high dependency ward. Today he is completely off oxygen support and he passed the swallowing test so he can start eating liquid/soft foods. He should be moved to a general ward on Monday. I never thought I would be so ridiculously happy to see someone eat soup.
