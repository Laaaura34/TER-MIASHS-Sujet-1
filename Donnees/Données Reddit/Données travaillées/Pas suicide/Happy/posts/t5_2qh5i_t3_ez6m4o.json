My hubby falls asleep before me. \n\nIt was particularly bad last night and in his sleep, he flopped over, garbled out \u201cI love you.\u201d And held onto me... I asked him several times what he said, what he was doing, etc. No response. Finally, I leaned my head into his chest and listened to his heart\u2019s calm beat. I immediately felt  a wave of tiredness and fell into a peaceful sleep. \n\nI woke up this morning and he had no recollection and seemed shocked to find out about it. He kept telling me I should\u2019ve woken him up, no matter how deep in sleep he was and he would\u2019ve helped. I reminded him that he kinda did even without realising. Even while asleep, he was trying to comfort me.\n\nHe was getting ready for work while I made his breakfast and immediately dropped his bag to hug me from behind around the waist and tell me it would be okay, he\u2019s there, etc. I thanked him but told him if he didn\u2019t let go and get moving, he\u2019d be late for work. His response?\n\n\u201cSome things are more important.\u201d :^)\n\nI always help him in the morning before work and he kept stopping me to hug/kiss/or just screw around with me to make me smile/laugh. I was so worried he\u2019d be late but it seems he JUST made it in time. Before he left, he declared we were having pizza, beer, and watching some anime when we\u2019re both home tonight and I just got so happy over the idea of him thinking ahead for \u201cus time\u201d, even though it\u2019s not really a new thing. \n\nIdk man I just had to post this because literally just being around him is the best and makes me all fuzzy... even 8 years later. It still feels like when we first met. Idk how I got so lucky. \n\nEven when he left, he texted me the same stuff he was saying and.. my heart is happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ez6m4o/some_things_are_more_important_the_little_things/", "title": "\u201cSome things are more important\u201d - the little things mean a lot.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "xOrionis", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1580892439, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ez6m4o/some_things_are_more_important_the_little_things/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439355.3582907, "replies_charged": false}
