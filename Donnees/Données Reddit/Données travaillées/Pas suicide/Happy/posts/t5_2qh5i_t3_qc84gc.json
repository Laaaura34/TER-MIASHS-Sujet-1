This calmed me down so much and with her on my lap, i managed to finish half of what took me days and weeks to go through. I feel like i\u2019m finally moving on with my life and this has taken a huge load off my back. \n\nWe\u2019ve always had cats but it\u2019s been almost two years since the last of them passed away. I never realised how much significance they actually had on my mental health growing up. I\u2019m so glad my neighbors cat likes me haha.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/qc84gc/neighbors_cat_helped_me_pull_my_life_together/", "title": "Neighbors cat helped me pull my life together", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "wynknight", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634756195, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/qc84gc/neighbors_cat_helped_me_pull_my_life_together/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439267.1811662, "replies_charged": false}
