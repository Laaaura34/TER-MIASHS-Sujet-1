Earlier this summer, I finished my final class, and last night, my diploma arrived in the mail. The nights of falling asleep doing homework, putting my kids to bed, then logging on to my classes, spending saturdays in the classroom, have finally paid off!\n\nI've been luckier and more privileged than I have any right to be, in that I've been able to make a pretty good living despite not having a degree, but I feel complete now. \n\nNext... a master's degree? Probably not for a bit :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/3kem9g/after_12_years_i_finally_got_my_diploma/", "title": "After 12 years, I finally got my diploma", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TopRamen713", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 206, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1441896043, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/3kem9g/after_12_years_i_finally_got_my_diploma/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442438.2510755, "replies_charged": false}
