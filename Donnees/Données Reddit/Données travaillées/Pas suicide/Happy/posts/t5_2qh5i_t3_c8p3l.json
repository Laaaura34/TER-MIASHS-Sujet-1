I didn't know the date that I joined, you see.\n\nApart from that, I am:\n\n* Graduating from college in a week, with a degree.\n\n* Got accepted into the university that I wanted, in advanced standing.\n\n* Got offered a $1000 scholarship to a university that I'm not planning on attending, but it was a nice thought anyway. \n\n* Moving out of the province in a month, so I won't be embarrassed about my french anymore.\n\n* Going out with the girls tonight.\n\nEven though the romantic part of my life is kind of tragic and unfortunate right now, everything is finally falling into place. I've routed my way through life for the next 2 years at least. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/c8p3l/life_is_good/", "title": "Life is good :)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Xuyen", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1274972650, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/c8p3l/life_is_good/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438840.7740874, "replies_charged": false}
