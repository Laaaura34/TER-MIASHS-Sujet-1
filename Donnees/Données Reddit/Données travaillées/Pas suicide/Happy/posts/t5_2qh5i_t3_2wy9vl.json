Today, it happened twice.\n\nFirst I got an email about a grant. I'd spoken to an institution a year ago about them maybe supporting me, and while positive, they hadn't promised anything and then time had passed and I'd figured it just hadn't happened for me. Well, today, I get an email that they've set me up for a seriously big sum and that they're just awaiting final confirmation a week from now. That was more than enough to make my half-year at least.\n\nBut then, last night I uploaded a video to youtube and posted it to /r/videos, hoping, really for some sweet dozen upvotes. That was not to be. The video rocketed and I've been fielding offers of representation and purchasing rights and all that stuff all day. To top it off, the last message I receive (so far), is from a very major network, asking if they can air it. I'm talking very major, like worldwide, cream of the crop major. I've been offered money, and these guys said they won't give me money. I told them yes anyways. I got money earlier and now I'm getting fame. Not really. But it feels pretty unreal.\n\nSo yea, this monday has been one for the history books of my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/2wy9vl/my_video_on_tv_and_a_big_research_grant_on_the/", "title": "My video on TV and a big research grant, on the same day", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Parelius", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1424749764, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2wy9vl/my_video_on_tv_and_a_big_research_grant_on_the/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441309.0353394, "replies_charged": false}
