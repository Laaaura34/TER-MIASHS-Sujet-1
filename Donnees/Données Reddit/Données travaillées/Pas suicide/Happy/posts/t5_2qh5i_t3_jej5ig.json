I\u2019m no longer anxious before work, I\u2019ve lost interest in other girls and don\u2019t even find other girls attractive anymore, I only care about her & making her happy. I\u2019ve never felt like this before, is this how people who are in love feel like then? \n\nShe\u2019s actually made me a better person around my family, I feel like so much stress & anxiety has left me. I have anxiety especially with talking on the phone. But she was so patient and understanding with me and now we talk daily on the phone because I\u2019m so comfortable and relaxed with her and my love for her fought the anxiety. \n\nJust confessing my happiness, don\u2019t mind me \ud83d\ude02", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jej5ig/my_new_girlfriend_has_erased_my_anxiety_and_im/", "title": "My new girlfriend has erased my anxiety and I\u2019m finally happy!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheBattinson", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603171023, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jej5ig/my_new_girlfriend_has_erased_my_anxiety_and_im/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442730.004568, "replies_charged": false}
