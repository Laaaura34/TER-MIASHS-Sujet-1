Standard depression bs, I've got a debt I gotta pay off soon that's been on my mind, I'm almost 100 pounds heavier then when I graduated highschool 2 years ago. All of this snowballed into each other when I was trying to sleep tonight. I had work in 5 hours and hadn't slept since 9 yesterday.\n\nWas just kind of laying there, being restless and annoyed until I decided to say screw it. It's the first day of 2019, I'm not going to let it end like this. So, at about 2, I got dressed, put on some coffee, and grabbed my smokes, snacks and speaker to sit at the smoke pit at my dorms and enjoy myself until I have to go in, and just listen to throw back music while i smoke and drink coffee.\n\nAnd i have to say, its helping. Like, I genuinely feel really good. I'm not worrying about any of that shit right now. I've just been browsing reddit while smoking, drinking coffee and listening to older nu metal bands I loved in highschool (Staind, System of a Down, and FFDP [I'm a fan of their first 2 albums] incase your curious). I'm actually smiling. I feel good. My decision to get up and do something actually turned my day around pretty well.\nFeels good, man", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/abrwue/i_havent_been_able_to_sleep_at_all_this_first_day/", "title": "I havent been able to sleep at all this first day of 2019, so I decided to make it relaxing at least.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Slayer_Fan_666", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1546421737, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/abrwue/i_havent_been_able_to_sleep_at_all_this_first_day/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442720.0695415, "replies_charged": false}
