I didn\u2019t realize it was wrong for years. I feel so guilty and bad about this so I just went shopping on Amazon to buy her some stuff. Did lots of research over the pst few days. I bought her necessities as well as some little extra things to make her happy. She\u2019s been getting out of her cave more recently to say hi to me, so it already seems like she was becoming a little happier and more outgoing. I hope these items will make her feel even better than that. She\u2019s so precious and cute <3 I love how she\u2019s always smiling and how she sleeps using her hide or water dish as a pillow haha. I\u2019m proud of myself for doing this, especially considering that I\u2019m so scared of spending money haha", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pgwehg/didnt_realize_for_the_longest_time_that_my/", "title": "Didn\u2019t realize for the longest time that my leopard gecko\u2019s tank had the wrong setup.
