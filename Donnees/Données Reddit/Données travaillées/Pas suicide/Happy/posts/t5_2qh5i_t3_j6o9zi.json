He has matured a lot, and I\u2019m happy to support him. I realized a lot of his passive behavior and immaturity came from depression he didn\u2019t want to identify with. I made the choice to stay, and I thought the healing already started last year, but I realize it\u2019s actually happening now. \n\nI was 300 pounds  and an undiagnosed type 1 diabetic as of last December. I\u2019m now 230, and working out daily to now turn left over fat into muscle. I\u2019m doing really well in college, have my cat Tinkerbell living with me, and gratefully unemployment has been keeping me a float. I plan on moving to another state with my partner, or without, to continue my dream of joining a trade school. \n\nI dance more often now. I have cut off nearly every friend I had in high school, as well as my boyfriend from his own group, because growing up meant realizing some people didn\u2019t want to see you succeed. Gratefully, unemployment has given us thousands of dollars while our families are helping support us to stay a float in these troubling times (but trust me I\u2019m looking for work everyday.) I can move all by myself and still be okay, and pay my own bills now. I have old friends who had been actual bullies, who still have nothing. And realizing those people didn\u2019t belong in my life, made me the woman I am today. I\u2019m just grateful to not be rude or degrading like they are. I\u2019m just grateful I left the mix of things, because 2 years ago I was depressed and crying daily that I missed them so much. It was so much better to let go, because I\u2019m much slimmer, smarter, faster, and I just... I\u2019m flying. \n\nAnd now I have thousands saved, a stronger bond with the current love of my life, and soon a career to start. \n\nI\u2019m just happy. Of course my relationship needs work, because we\u2019re both always going through changes and we\u2019re young. And working out with my health and body image isn\u2019t always easy every day. But I am happy. I have my love, life, and family, and my kitty. I\u2019m just happy. I\u2019m grateful. And I hope everyone else becomes happier in these tough times too.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/j6o9zi/i_was_300_pounds_extremely_sick_had_terrible/", "title": "I was 300 Pounds, Extremely sick, had terrible friends in 2018/19, and now : I\u2019m a completely different person.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "captaindrom", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1602065529, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/j6o9zi/i_was_300_pounds_extremely_sick_had_terrible/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440606.3988414, "replies_charged": false}
