I recently graduated with a graduate degree and while I was relieved, it never really sunk in that this was an accomplishment of any sort. I dismissed it as being just another thing, it wasn't a big deal, it wasn't like I graduated with a perfect score or whatever.\nA couple people I met in random settings told me they were proud of me for having completed an advanced degree and moving to a new country to accomplish it. I did not realize how good it would feel to hear that. Even my chatty Uber driver said that and it made my night. I just wanted to express my gratitude to all those awesome, supportive people!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ehz65g/i_had_people_who_were_practically_strangers_tell/", "title": "I had people who were practically strangers tell me how proud they were of me for accomplishments I was being dismissive of and it means a lot to me.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ithinkidonotthink", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 66, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1577774046, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ehz65g/i_had_people_who_were_practically_strangers_tell/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438830.9340153, "replies_charged": false}
