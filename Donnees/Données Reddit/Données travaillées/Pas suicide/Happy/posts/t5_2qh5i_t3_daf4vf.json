Barely  reclined it's more of a chair. Anyway 50km is a first for me.\n\nWaiting on the result of an job interview for a secondment that would perfectly match my CIPS qualification I am about to start and which would give me a 50% raise for six months. Which takes us from just about ticking along to having cash spare.\n\nAlso just got given my step mums car as she can't drive anymore (driving instructor so it's a Toyota yaris with 100k on it). Been trying to take lessons but I have broken two different toes  in 4 months which is preventing me getting anywhere.\n\nGonna be a very busy year if it all works out but means we can actually book a proper holiday next summer!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/daf4vf/lots_of_positives_to_balance_out_waiting_on/", "title": "Lots of positives to balance out waiting on interview result stress.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AnotherNewme", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1569672343, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/daf4vf/lots_of_positives_to_balance_out_waiting_on/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438937.1469543, "replies_charged": false}
