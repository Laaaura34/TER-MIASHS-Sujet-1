I forced myself to uni for a few months before finally quitting and basically didnt do anything after that for half a year. a few months ago i finally got my shit together and got a job again and applied to universities. Due to corona tho only 10% would be admitted thro admission tests and 90% with grades (normally it was 40/60). In finland you can go back to get higher grades but i got the news too late and kinda accepted i wouldn't get admitted this year either as i could't get in the year before even with much better odds. Somehow against all my expectations (mind you im quite optimistic) i managed to get good enough results and was admitted today. It's a huge weight of my shoulders and i finally get to study what i love.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hnq6xf/against_all_my_expectations_i_got_admitted_to_my/", "title": "Against all my expectations i got admitted to my dream university and major.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "internet_explored", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 20, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594244357, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/hnq6xf/against_all_my_expectations_i_got_admitted_to_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441984.2943509, "replies_charged": false}
