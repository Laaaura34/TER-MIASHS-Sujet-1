Now I am in a wonderful and healthy relationship, have numerous friends whom I love and support and who in turn love and support me, in great shape (at least, healthy enough. Sadly, I do not have galloping abs yet), confident and calm despite the pandemic turning the world upside down, and I've been working full time as a voice actor for the last 6 months, after juggling waiting tables, theatre, AND voice acting jobs for the last five years, and have a total of SIX BOOKS scheduled to record over the course of the next three months.\n\nI'm grateful to everyone I've met along this journey, learned so much, and am happy with where I've come, and I'm excited for where I will go. The future is vast, unknowable, and chaotic. That's what makes it so fun. I hope that everyone is able to keep moving forward, and strive to reach their goals and aspirations. It's a crazy world out there, so I'll do my best to give everyone a helping hand, and I hope you do the same.\n\nThanks for reading my little happy blurb. I hope you have a great day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/il80w9/five_years_makes_one_hell_of_a_difference/", "title": "Five Years Makes One Hell of a Difference", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "HWKramerVO", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1599057624, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/il80w9/five_years_makes_one_hell_of_a_difference/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439335.385238, "replies_charged": false}
