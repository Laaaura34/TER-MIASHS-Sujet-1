You all know of the asian parents meme. What if I told you it's true?  \nMy parents have really really high standards for me. I have to do well, act correctly, etc. Today, I got a C in my english class for not completing an assignment (early in the year, assignments affect grades more profoundly). Anyway, the conversation between my parents and I escalated to whether they were proud of me or not. My mother said she was proud, but she is really nice so I didn't think much of it. Then, my strict father, said this: \"What makes you think I'm not proud of you?\"  \nNow, I'm a 13 year old. I'm in eighth grade. At least for me, at this age, I want to be the tough, thick-skinned one. Things aren't supposed to get to me. But right there, at the dinner table, over rice and chinese dishes, I started crying. I finally did it! I finally got my father to be proud...\n\nSo that was my day in a whole. I'm sorry if this seems like a bit of a ramble. Thank you for reading this. I hope both sides of your pillow are cold tonight.
