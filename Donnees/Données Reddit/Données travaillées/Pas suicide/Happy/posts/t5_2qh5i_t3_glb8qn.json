This dream seemed way more real than any other I have had in awhile. I remembered it very vividly too. As the plane was about to crash I thought \u201cwell this is it, lets see what happens\u201d. I had only a second to realize I was probably gonna die. Not to say I was ready but I didn\u2019t have time to worry. I was gonna embrace it, and I closed my eyes and waited. Heard a huge explosion and guess what we didn\u2019t die, and the rest of the dream was really fucking weird but mostly happy. That one little moment made me realize actually to take in life\u2019s little pleasures. I love my family, I love my friends, and I hope the bad people in the world turn to the light side. Fuck and I love woman. So imma just be happy. Even if no one sees this just,  it will feel good to write.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/glb8qn/had_a_bad_dream_that_made_me_put_things_in/", "title": "Had a bad dream that made me put things in perspective", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Capri-Sun69", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1589700149, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/glb8qn/had_a_bad_dream_that_made_me_put_things_in/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442229.4507794, "replies_charged": false}
