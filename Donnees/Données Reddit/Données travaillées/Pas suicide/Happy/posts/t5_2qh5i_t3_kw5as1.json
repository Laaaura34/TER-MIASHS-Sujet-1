Every time we talk I can\u2019t stop smiling. I can talk to him all day and I want to encourage him nonstop! He makes every morning so nice. The other day as I was falling asleep texting him I had to pause and just soak in the feeling of bliss I got from talking to him. I felt so happy. This morning when I woke up to stretch my knee a bit and I looked at the sun I felt butterflies from happiness. I just felt really lucky to wake up in a world where he exists.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kw5as1/my_friend_has_been_helping_me_overcome_a_very/", "title": "My friend has been helping me overcome a very difficult situation and I\u2019m so grateful!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Demonic_Hero_", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610499602, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/kw5as1/my_friend_has_been_helping_me_overcome_a_very/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439190.1722744, "replies_charged": false}
