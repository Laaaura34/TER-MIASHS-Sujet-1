But the reason I feel like there's hope for humanity is because of the Internet. I know wtf right? How does that give you hope if anything it should make you feel the opposite. Well when I see the Internet I see a global consciousness, a way to inform people of something, a means to world wide communication, a way to spread truth a way to learn regardless of wealth or social class. I see the hive mind for humanity a way to spread thoughts and ideas globally. Although it doesn't sound like it could \"save\" the world I feel like every problems solution lies withing the depths of the Internet. I know alot of people don't believe that but I guarantee that it's true. Any problem you have someone else has had it, any world wide spread problem could be solved with someone's findings that could be found on the Internet. The problem is just laziness and fear of real change. \n\nTl;dr: the Internet holds the answers to our global and even our everyday problems, laziness and fear of change prevents us from following through with solutions", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1es8js/recently_a_friend_asked_me_what_kept_me_motivated/", "title": "Recently a friend asked me what kept me motivated when the prognosis of humanity looks so bleak this is what I told him", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "g04th34d1", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1369165668, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1es8js/recently_a_friend_asked_me_what_kept_me_motivated/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440800.119037, "replies_charged": false}
