I\u2019ve spoken about her before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bc7q4k/my_niece_is_autistic_and_nobody_is_listening/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). Since that post she\u2019s made a lot of progress. She is now in speech and occupational therapy. She speaks a lot more and is a lot more social, although she is still very much not a typical three year old. Yesterday she had such a great day. She let me hold her(she is very shy with people and takes forever to warm up to them, won\u2019t go near you unless it\u2019s someone she sees often like her parents. I don\u2019t see her much because I\u2019m a college student with a job not to mention covid), gave me kisses on the face for the first time, and said my name for the first time. It was all I could do not to bawl my eyes out because this is a child that two months ago couldn\u2019t string two words together, a kid that opens the door and runs into the street and doesn\u2019t really understand \u201cno\u201d or \u201cstop,\u201d a kid who has never said her own name. Although I\u2019ve tried to keep an open mind and hope she\u2019ll improve, I\u2019d still very much accepted the distinct possibility that \u201cAuntie\u201d was a word I\u2019d never hear. I\u2019m so happy I want to scream it from the rooftops and bake a gf cake.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/iadaux/my_developmentally_delayed_niece_said_my_name_for/", "title": "My Developmentally Delayed Niece Said My Name For The Very First Time", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SinfullySinatra", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 38, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597518290, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iadaux/my_developmentally_delayed_niece_said_my_name_for/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442850.3885796, "replies_charged": false}
