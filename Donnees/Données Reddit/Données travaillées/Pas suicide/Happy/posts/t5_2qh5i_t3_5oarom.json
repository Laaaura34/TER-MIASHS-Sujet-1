I found one, It's called lily bar hahahaha. Really fancy but relatively inexpensive, pretty much just me and a bar tender who doesn't speak my language. I don't know why but I'm really happy, been kinda feeling off for the last few weeks,  wouldn't you say depressed though.\n\nThere's just something about this very moment that released this happiness and while I sorted through the \"Japanese only\" bars and the girl clubs, I just had this big stupid grin on my face and I don't know why.\n\nI don't know why I'm writing this and I doubt people will care, but damn it I'm happy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/5oarom/i_am_in_a_bar_alone_in_japan_and_i_havent_been/", "title": "I am in a bar alone in Japan and I haven't been this happy in a while!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ugotmilk", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 578, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1484572474, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5oarom/i_am_in_a_bar_alone_in_japan_and_i_havent_been/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439345.8269928, "replies_charged": false}
