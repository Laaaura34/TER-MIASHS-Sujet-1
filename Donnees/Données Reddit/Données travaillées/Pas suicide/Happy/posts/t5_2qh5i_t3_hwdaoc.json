I wake up every day and look over at him and cannot help but get the biggest smile on my face. He is so supportive with everything I do and he helps me work towards achieving my goals and keeps me grounded when my mental health is dipping down. I could go on and on and on for days. I am really insecure about my weight but he reassures me all the time that he loves me and how I look and he likes to make sure I never forget it. Yesterday morning, I woke up to a surprise breakfast in bed of homemade breakfast burritos with all of my favorite ingredients and later on in the day when I was having really bad cramps, he went out and got me \u201cyummy comfort food\u201d which made me feel better. We have spent the past week watching Avatar together every night because I have never seen it all the way through, and it is honestly one of my favorite activities we have done in a while. \n\nI\u2019m really not sure if these are the types of things posted here, so I am sorry if this rambling nonsense is off, but I just can\u2019t hold it in any longer. I am so happy for the first time in so long and I just wanted to share.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hwdaoc/i_am_blessed_with_the_best_boyfriend_i_could_ask/", "title": "I am blessed with the best boyfriend I could ask for and it has made me happier than I have felt in YEARS", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "istoleyourcats", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595499968, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/hwdaoc/i_am_blessed_with_the_best_boyfriend_i_could_ask/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439142.8567545, "replies_charged": false}
