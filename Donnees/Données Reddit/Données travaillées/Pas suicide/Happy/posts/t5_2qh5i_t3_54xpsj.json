I am so overwhelmed over this little thing. \n\nI got a grant for my undergrad education from the school I am going to. $11,000 for seemingly no reason at all. \n\nI don't understand why I got it. I turned in my FASFA a couple days ago. I was going to transfer to a cheaper school after bombing my Senior year. I had horrible anxiety that would barely let me leave my house, then when I started to recover I busted my knee and could barely sit in class due to the pain, let alone walk. I graduated one course last year. How would I qualify for a grant? let alone a substantial one.\n\nI go to school part time so I can go to work full time. I am at the end of what the federal gov will give me for aid. With this grant I can potentially stay at my current school. The one I absolutely love and was so heartbroken to leave and graduate here. With this grant I can cover my part time studies without taking out any loans, fed or private. \n\nI doubt that financial aid office knew how much this would mean to me when they awarded me this. I doubt that knew how happy I would be when they clicked that option. It means the world to me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/54xpsj/i_got_a_grant_to_finish_at_my_current_school_i_do/", "title": "I got a grant to finish at my current school.
