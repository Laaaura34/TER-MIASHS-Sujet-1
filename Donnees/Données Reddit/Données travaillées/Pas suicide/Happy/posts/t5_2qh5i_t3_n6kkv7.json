The lockdown has been pretty harsh and the last few days haven\u2019t been easy to get by. \n\nToday, I finally caught a break in life by getting an internship I\u2019ve been relentlessly pursuing for the last 6 months. After a lot hard work, lot of ins and outs, lots of twists and turns, I\u2019ve finally gotten the internship and am a bit happy. And I am extremely proud of getting this internship because I had to hustle a lot and stray far off from my comfort zone. \n\nNow that the internship offer has sunk in, I\u2019m afraid of something terrible would happen to me soon which would plunge me back into sorrow. The fact that I\u2019m in India, a country where the Covid pandemic is wrecking havoc of an unimaginable magnitude doesn\u2019t really help. \n\nI feel I\u2019ve somewhat lose the ability to be happy because I view it as a precursor to negativity, a red herring so to speak. I\u2019ve got to learn to be happy once again. \n\nI was a happy kid growing up, and that\u2019s what I got to be like.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/n6kkv7/had_a_good_day_and_now_im_a_bit_terrified_sigh/", "title": "Had a good day and now I\u2019m a bit terrified, sigh", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Travis-Walden", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620342985, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n6kkv7/had_a_good_day_and_now_im_a_bit_terrified_sigh/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440586.3901415, "replies_charged": false}
