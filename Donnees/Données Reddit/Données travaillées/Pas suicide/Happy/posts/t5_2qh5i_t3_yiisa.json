I've had a hard time meeting girls recently due to living in a college town and not actually being part of the college. But Jennifer was awesome. She had real life experience having traveled and working for what she had. She doesn't smoke, drink, drugs, etc... and that is rare to find! Good Humored and a beautiful smile. Unfortunately though I am moving in a couple of days and couldn't bring myself to ask her to get together later this night. Morally I couldn't do it even though it seemed so damn right. So I am chalking it up to having at least met a girl that hadn't turned me off in anyway by what she said/did. It's refreshing knowing that people of the kinder more reserved heart still exist. I hope I will find her counterpart in my new home. I am just happy to have met.\n\n\nTLDR; awesome girl gave me hope that kind hearted people still exist.
