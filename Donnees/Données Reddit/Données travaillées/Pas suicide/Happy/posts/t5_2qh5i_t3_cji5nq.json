I\u2019ve recently fallen in love with my best friend, I got promoted at work, I make good money, I have awesome credit, my savings are stacked, my relationship with my family is the best it\u2019s been in years, I\u2019m losing weight, gaining confidence and I have a solid group of friends I can count on.\n\n\nIf you had told me this is what my life was going to be like a year ago, I would not have believed it. But it\u2019s my reality now and I am so so happy and thankful to be where I am today. I had to put this out here because the happiness I feel is uncontainable.
