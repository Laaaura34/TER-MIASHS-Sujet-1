I have been extremely stressed this week because I have an extremely busy weekend between work, family stuff, and a double date with some friends. Also my cousin ended up going to the hospital yesterday. So all around a very stressful week and I was supposed to write a test on Monday morning and wasn't sure how I was going to find time to study. Turns out my teacher decided to give us a take home test so I was able to finish it this afternoon and the stress of finding time to study has been erased! This has been a very unexpected load off my shoulders.
