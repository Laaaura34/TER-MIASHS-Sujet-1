Haven\u2019t had supper yet and I'm feeling like some of my favorite almost fast food Mexican food drive through. I'm in my jammies and house-shoes. It\u2019s not far, so I go there and get in the drive through behind another car who seems like he cant make up his mind. No problem for me- I'm in no hurry and I already know what I want. Two soft chicken tacos and a big piece of their amazing chocolate cake. Yum!\n\nMy turn! As soon as I pull up the speaker guy says \u201cBe right with you.\u201d Immediately comes back and says \u201cJust to let you know, sir- we don't have any beef fajitas and we\u2019re out of shredded beef.\u201d No sweat. So I order. \u201cMay I have two soft chicken tacos and a big piece of chocolate cake?\u201d \u201cYes Sir but I'm not going to charge you for the cake ($4.00) because we\u2019re out of ground beef.\u201d OK with me! Free Cake!! \n\nSo I pull up and he greets me and I hand him my card and he hands me my bag. Look in the bag and I say \u201cHot sauce?\u201d nicely. He grins, hands me my card back, hands me my two hot sauces and says \u201cI'm not gonna charge you for this, You have a nice night, now.\u201d Cool! \u201cThank you very much, Sir!!\u201d\nI drive away- basking in the glow. Of free food for no reason except that he was a nice guy. And I guess I was too. Love that place! This really just happened an hour ago.
