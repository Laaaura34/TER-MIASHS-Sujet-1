Are you going to celebrate?!\nPatient: Yea, I am.\nMe: What are you going to do?\nPatient: Just be happy.\n\n\u2022It could always be worse, right?\n\n\u2022Me: Are you celebrating tonight?\nPatient: Well\u2026anymore I try to celebrate every day.\n\n\u2022Patient: It really is all about the little things.
