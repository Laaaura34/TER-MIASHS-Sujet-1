Then I moved to South Florida where unfortunately there is no Uno's Pizza.  Sure, you can get the frozen stuff, and the thin crust is pretty widely available, but who cares about that.\n\nUno's, IMHO, has hands-down the best deep-dish pizza in the world.  And I've eaten a lot of pizza.\n\nNormally if I get the urge, I have to drive 2-3 hours out of town to go find an Uno's, so of course I get Uno's very rarely.\n\nWell today, in Target, lo and behold, there is a non-frozen refrigerated deep dish Uno's pizza in their deli section.  The last one, too.\n\nI immediately purchased it, whistled for a cab and when it came near I saw the license plate said 'fresh' and it had dice in the mirror, and I took that pizza home just as fast as I could and cooked it and NOM NOM NOMd it all up.\n\nAnd, knowing I can go back tomorrow and get another one, makes me really, really happy.\n\n**tl;dr TARGET HAS UNO'S DEEP DISH PIZZA NOW YAY!**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hc3v0/satiated_with_unos_pizza/", "title": "Satiated with Uno's Pizza.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pr1mu5", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1305499700, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/hc3v0/satiated_with_unos_pizza/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442754.7856312, "replies_charged": false}
