I already know it won't work out between us but I don't care even in the slightest. I knew from the second I saw you that I liked you, and the second you spoke I knew that I loved you. I knew the whole time that we would never be together, but I don't care. I'm just so happy that you exist, and happy that I can bask in your light and you in mine. I'm so happy I get the time to get more comfortable around you. I cannot wait until I know you love me too, so I can stop worrying about what you think of me, and soak every cell in my body with you. To be near you, and love you, is bliss!!
