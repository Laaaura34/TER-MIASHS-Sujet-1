He has for years, as they have aged. They\u2019re like grand parents for my brother and I. My dad mows their lawn when he mows ours. He always cooks a lot of food, and we will always take a plate next door for them. Her husband passed away last year, so my dad has stepped up feeding her. And she loves it. \n\nToday she decided to return the favor. She misses cooking for her family, as everyone has moved away. So she decided to cook for us. Miss Lynn came over this morning to put the chicken and sauces in the crockpot. Brought over a salad to eat with it, and fresh fruit to enjoy as a desert. A few hours later, she brought over home made dumplings to add to her meal. Chicken and dumplings! She refused to eat and share with us, as she had her own dinner. \n\nIt was really, really cool to see her doing this for us. No one asked her, and she didn\u2019t have to. But Miss Lynn wanted to do something for us. My dad just had surgery, and can\u2019t cook as much as he would like it. So she took it into her own hands. \n\nNeighbors helping neighbors. Just like it use to be.
