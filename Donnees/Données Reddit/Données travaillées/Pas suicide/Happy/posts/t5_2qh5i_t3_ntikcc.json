We had been texting for 3 weeks and had called a few times so we already knew each other pretty well. We met up and decided to stay in the car and get coffee as it was raining. We parked in a quiet spot next to a river and talked while listening to music and drinking our coffee. I then told her I really liked her and she said she did too. We gazed at each others' eyes and I looked down very briefly at her lips, so did she. We went for the kiss and made out for quite a while. I was like 'that was nice', and we dit it again! She laid her head on my shoulder and the feeling that gave me was literally out of this world. We decided to go for a little highway cruise while listening to music and talking and she held my hand the entire time. I dropped her back off home after 2 hours and a half and we kissed twice again. We hugged and she told me she didn't want to let go.\n\nA month before this I felt like a total loser for never having even touched a girls hand and look at me now, I feel like a million bucks. I have a feeling she might soon be my first girlfriend, too...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ntikcc/i_just_kissed_for_the_first_time_at_age_21/", "title": "I just kissed for the first time, at age 21", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ythoww", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 633, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622974341, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ntikcc/i_just_kissed_for_the_first_time_at_age_21/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441808.72535, "replies_charged": false}
