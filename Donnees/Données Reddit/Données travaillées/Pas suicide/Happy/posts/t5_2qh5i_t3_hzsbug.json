I\u2019ve been feeling more depressed and anxious lately, as I\u2019ve always had my life planned out, and now I have nothing figured out and it\u2019s been really awful for my mental state. \n\nBut tonight, I truly realized how much the people in my life really do love and care about me. I had a panic attack over something my grandma said; honestly it was probably bound to happen at some point, and what she said just pushed me over the edge. And after talking to my boyfriend on the phone, and him calming me down and then us just talking made me feel a thousand times better. And my mom helped me too. \n\nThey both, including my dad who lives in another state, have just been so supportive of me and have been nothing but understanding and caring while I\u2019ve been going through what I\u2019ve been going through. And they just make me so happy. I don\u2019t know where I would be without them in my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hzsbug/ive_had_a_pretty_rough_summer_but_im_so_happy/", "title": "I\u2019ve had a pretty rough summer, but I\u2019m so happy with the people in my life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "disguised_mermaid", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595989474, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/hzsbug/ive_had_a_pretty_rough_summer_but_im_so_happy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439332.10061, "replies_charged": false}
