This morning I was introduced to one of our regulars; a very charming, 98 year old veteran. I put together a bouquet for him, and we talked about the weather and the holidays. He maintained very steady eye contact with me through the whole transaction, and he smiled a lot. Before he left, he reached out, took my hand and said, \"I've been on this earth for 98 years, and never in my life have I seen a face as beautiful as yours.\" I turned ten shades of red and giggled like a child. I was so touched that when he left, I almost cried. Thank you, Jack. You sure know how to make a girl feel special. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/a8fxen/i_received_the_best_compliment_of_my_life_today/", "title": "I received the best compliment of my life today.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rmg2289", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 39, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1545437281, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a8fxen/i_received_the_best_compliment_of_my_life_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439384.2251282, "replies_charged": false}
