After two years of toiling away for \"the man\" and getting nothing to show for it, I have finally overcome! \n\nThis all started two weeks ago, when I woke up one morning and said. \"I'm quitting my job today\" to my fiancee. He agreed that it was the right move since I was nothing but miserable there. I walked in and told them it would be my last shift that night and didn't go back.  I was a little concerned about finances, but because of our additional home business we thought we could stretch it until I found another job.\n\nLess than a week after quitting, we were shopping our local urban gardening store.  I mentioned to the owner I was looking for work and she basically hired me on the spot.\n\nSo, upvotes for a spell of good fortune, the job of my dreams and my life taking all the most amazing paths it ever has, and for all of you who keep me laughing and amused day after day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/f44d6/first_day_of_the_rest_of_my_life/", "title": "First day of the rest of my life...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "greenwomanoftheriver", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 61, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1295311236, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/f44d6/first_day_of_the_rest_of_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440884.594367, "replies_charged": false}
