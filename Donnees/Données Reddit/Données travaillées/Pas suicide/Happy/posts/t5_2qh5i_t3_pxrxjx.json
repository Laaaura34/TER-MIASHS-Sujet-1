We talk daily and he\u2019s just the most positive, worldly person I have ever known. He makes me feel sexy and he makes me feel loved. He told me he was proud of me for telling my husband I wanted to leave, he told me I\u2019m not a burden.\n\nHe gives me butterflies and makes me smile more than I have in a long time. \n\nWhile we\u2019re not IN love with each other (he has some past trauma of his own) I love him so dearly and have found myself wanting to keep his beautiful smile on his equally gorgeous face. \n\nI love you N, and I hope you will always be in my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pxrxjx/you_are_the_most_wonderful_and_unexpected_thing/", "title": "You are the most wonderful and unexpected thing to ever happen to me, and I love you so much.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "troutmush", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632908411, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pxrxjx/you_are_the_most_wonderful_and_unexpected_thing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439068.7317677, "replies_charged": false}
