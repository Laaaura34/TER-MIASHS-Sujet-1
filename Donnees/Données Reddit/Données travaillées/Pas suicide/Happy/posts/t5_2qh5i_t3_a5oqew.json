I am also a single mom of three who had been unemployed and living on student loans for most of that time. But today, today I got the call. I have passed my background check and drug screen and all the other pre- employment hoops I had to jump through and have been green lit to start new hire orientation at University of Kansas medical center as a student RT this coming Monday. I have one semester left in school and my board exams and I'll finally have met my goal. Today was a giant leap in getting there since the work experience will be a huge advantage on my resume.\n\nI just had to share, Monday I had $20 in my checking account and no idea how I was going to survive until my next disbursement, today I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.
