I doubt this goes anywhere or to anyone, but it feels right to type it out and send it to someone else in the world. Haven\u2019t had much luck recently w anything and coming out of a long relationship didn\u2019t help. However, I met a girl on a dating app and pursued it outside of online interactions. We have continued to hang out and it genuinely just feels so good to feel appreciated again. Sure, friends and family offer love and attention that feels great and is necessary. However, attention with romantic intent is something that cannot be found as easily and deserves appreciation and acknowledgment. \n\nIt feels good to feel like I am a young teen with butterflies in my stomach again. It feels good to learn about someone new and all they have experienced in this life so far. It feels good to be me right now and I can\u2019t say that often, so I want to when and while\nI can. :) \n\nIf you have read this far, I wish nothing but the best for you in this little journey we are all going through. I love you and I will never even know you", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/q04vb8/experiencing_emotions_that_have_been_gone_for/", "title": "Experiencing emotions that have been gone for quite some time.
