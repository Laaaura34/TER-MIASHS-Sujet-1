I was waiting for my bestfriend to be my first dance. I was so insecure. Felt so ugly. Hated myself so much. Until today.\n\nThen I have just realized just now, I had the best prom ever. Not because of the boys who danced with me. Not because of the friends. But because of my mom.\n\nMy mom was so supportive of me and my fashion designing skills. Before the prom, she asked me what I'd want to wear. Then I drew the design that I wanted, showed it to her, she felt proud and hired a tailor to make it come to life. So the dress that I wore on my prom was my design. Yup! And my mom's so happy and proud that time. That's one of the best moments of my life that I never got to appreciate before.\n\nI love my mom.
