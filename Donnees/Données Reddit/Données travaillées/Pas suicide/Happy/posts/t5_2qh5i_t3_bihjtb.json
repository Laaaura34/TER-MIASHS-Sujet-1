Then I won an oral storytelling contest in my city, which I also entered only for fun. Now I'm negotiating writing the story for a choose-your-own-adventure computer game. All three events are unrelated except that they're about telling stories.\n\nIt's very surreal and unexpected. I make sandwiches part time while studying in an unrelated field, I had no plans to do writing or storytelling as a profession and in a matter of weeks it seems like it's all I'm doing (in the best way). \n\nYou truly never know what might happen!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/bihjtb/telling_stories_is_taking_a_major_role_in_my_life/", "title": "Telling stories is taking a major role in my life suddenly and I love it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "destiny-jr", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1556494411, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bihjtb/telling_stories_is_taking_a_major_role_in_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440706.9768922, "replies_charged": false}
