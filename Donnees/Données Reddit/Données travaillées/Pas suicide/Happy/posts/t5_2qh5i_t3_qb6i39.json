(not to mention lots and lots of money, power and status)\n\nFor true joy, imagine this: A modest house in a small town, with your soulmate, with your ride or die best friends as your neighbors, having a family and getting drunk with your friends at a local bar, breaking rules (not serious ones, just little ones for fun), etc. You live with nature as the woods in your backyard and have all the cute pets and friends your heart desires.
