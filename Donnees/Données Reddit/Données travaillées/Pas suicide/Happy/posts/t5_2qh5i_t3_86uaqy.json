I'll do my best...\n\n\nMy marriage ended back in September, and I finally moved out in February (we have two kids together, so I stuck it out for them). I moved back home to live on the floor of my mom's living room. \n\nI had no job (I was the stay at home parent for the entire marriage), no money, and never learned how to drive. I've been donating plasma just so I could have SOME of my own money, and not have to rely entirely on my mom for financial support. \n\nThis started on February 10th. Since then, however, I havd not only started driving finally, but I actually got my license a couple days ago! A day before that, I got hired for a really good job that I know I'll be amazing at, and it also has the potential for advancement. Also at this time, I started dating someone who is amazing to me. She's everything I never had when I was married. \n\nI now go to bed and wake up feeling happy and excited about my life and life in general. I'm no longer scared of what the next day will entail, because I know I have what it takes to live through it. \n\nI've finally found my happiness, and I just wanted to share it with others. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/86uaqy/id_like_to_share_a_little_something_with_you_guys/", "title": "I'd like to share a little something with you guys...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hellslave", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1521910607, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/86uaqy/id_like_to_share_a_little_something_with_you_guys/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438846.7442617, "replies_charged": false}
