I\u2019ve struggled with self-esteem issues and mental illnesses since I was young, and they\u2019ve been bad for the past month or so. Despite my emotions still feeling muted and everything feeling unreal, I think this is the happiest I\u2019ve felt probably all year. \n\nI also felt so so grateful to my family for being so supportive. The first person I called was my mom, and she was so excited. Then I texted my sister, and she video called me right away (she\u2019s abroad right now) and told me my mom had called her crying to let her know. She told me she was proud of me and let me know I was going with an almost full ride (I\u2019d looked over the financial package already but had misinterpreted it). \n\nMy family decided to go out to dinner to celebrate and I felt really giddy. My parents kept telling me how proud they were and told me they knew I could do it. It really meant a lot because my dad was slightly emotionally abusive in the past which contributed to my mental health problems (as was my sister). In the moment I realized how far we\u2019ve come as a family, and it just felt good to be praised considering how during most of my adolescent years I was constantly pressured to achieve (and failed at times). \n\nThen I called my grandparents in Korea. They were beyond happy and my paternal grandparents said they\u2019d pay for my tuition and everything. I called my maternal grandma afterwards, and she was pretty calm but I could tell she was excited. She told me she hadn\u2019t called in a while because she didn\u2019t want to interrupt my studies, and something else that really touched me was that she said she\u2019d been \u201cpraying for me even though our religions our different\u201d. \n\nWhile I was writing this my dad came to congratulate me again and gave me a hug. I am so lucky and grateful to have such supportive people in my life :\u2019)\n\nI know my problems aren\u2019t over, but I just feel so content.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/e9hqfh/got_into_my_top_choice_college_and_am_feeling/", "title": "Got into my top choice college and am feeling quite grateful.
