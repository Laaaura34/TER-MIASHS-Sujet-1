I left the front page feeling better and with a smile on my face.  Does that count?   Too many days the top stories are dominated by politics, or negative stories, but not today my friends.  The sea was not angry today.   Hope y'all have a chance to enjoy it as well.   Happy days (o.k. one day, but maybe it will continue).  Be well and take care all.
