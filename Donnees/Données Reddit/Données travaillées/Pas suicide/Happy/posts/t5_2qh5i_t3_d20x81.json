I went through a really dark spot and was struggling with addiction and severe depression. \n\nAbout two years ago, I cleaned up my act and got a decent job. Not enough to live well, but enough to make it through day to day.\n\nOne year ago, I started an MBA program and I'm making almost straight A's (3.88).\n\nIn May, my mom was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer which has a very bad prognosis.\n\nToday, my mom started her second round of chemo and is dealing with it very well. I also got an email from a recruiter at a job that I had applied to at a Fortune 250 company for almost twice as much money as I'm making now. And the job itself is something I'd actually be excited to do!\n\nTo all of you grinding it out right now with hopes for the future, there is hope! Keep doing your best and it will pay off!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/d20x81/the_dark_days_are_over_i_just_got_a_new_job/", "title": "The dark days are over!
