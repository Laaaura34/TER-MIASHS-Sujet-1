I knew the moment I came to the country that this was where I was meant to be, where my ideals of bravery, freedom and equality would be respected and valued. It took so much from me to maintain a dignified silence and not bawl my eyes out when taking the oath. But I did it!\n\nFriends and family congratulate me, but to me, the real hard work starts now. \n\nIn JFK\u2019s very memorable words: And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you \u2014 ask what you can do for your country. \n\nIt is such a privilege to be able to have the choice to be a citizen of the country of your choice and I am overwhelmed and grateful that I was given the opportunity!
