I've suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts for almost a year now. I lost a lot my selfworth and that faithful day October 8th, 2021. I'm in high school marching band, Junior Varsity block which is harder to get a Marcher of the Week(a good job in band). It was halftime at the football game we got out there and got set up, they called out the Marchers of the Week, I didn't hear my name in there so I cast it aside, then after the show after we did the school fight song. Whilst we were toward the football players' inflatable entrance they called the marchers of the week, and I heard it: My name!. I was jumping up and down and got into line with the rest of the band. Once we got back in the stands, I then cried I was so happy. I told people that I got it and got multiple hugs.
