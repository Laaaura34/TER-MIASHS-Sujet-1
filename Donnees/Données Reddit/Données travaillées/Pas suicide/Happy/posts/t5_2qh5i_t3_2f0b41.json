It was just the day after the video, \"this is how not to react when you're soon comes out as gay,\" seemed to hit and go viral, and I've seen so many poor reactions to others coming out.  Everyone has been super-open and supportive though, and I feel incredibly fortunate to be surrounded by such awesome, accepting people. I have been happier in the days since than I think I've been for several years.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/2f0b41/im_surrounded_by_amazing_people/", "title": "I'm surrounded by amazing people", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LurkyBeer", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 88, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1409410360, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2f0b41/im_surrounded_by_amazing_people/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440873.755514, "replies_charged": false}
