I lost all interest in a social life and basically didn\u2019t have the energy to do anything. I love books and reading so it\u2019s basically all that got me through those years. It\u2019s been a year now since my kidney transplant and I somehow woke up a few days ago feeling like I\u2019ve been ungrateful and feeling like I not only need to pick myself up off the floor but the WANT to do it. So I decided I needed to apply to college, filed for aid, got approved for grants and applied to SNHU majoring in English so that I could somehow make a living out of my love for reading. Today I woke up feeling better than I have in a long time I also feel relieved and like a weights been lifted. \n\n\nEdit: THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD! And on my first post!
