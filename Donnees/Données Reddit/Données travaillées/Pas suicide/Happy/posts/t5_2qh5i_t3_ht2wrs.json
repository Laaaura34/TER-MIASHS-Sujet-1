We were recent college grads with zero prospects.  For years, we made it by on paycheck advances, odd jobs, credit cards and unemployment, while barely making rent and student loan payments. \n\nBut just this week, we were hit with busted sink pipes, unexpected car repair and a necessary surgery for our dog...and we can afford it (without credit) and without taking a big hit.\n\nWe have worked so hard to get to where we are. And this is the first time unforeseen circumstances racked up a big bill...and it didn't make me panic, because we are just fine. Reflecting on how far we have come I just feel so proud and so blessed. I can't believe we've made it!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ht2wrs/my_husband_and_i_have_been_hit_with_a_whirlwind/", "title": "My husband and I have been hit with a whirlwind of unexpected expenses...and we can afford them!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "heylistenlady", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 273, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595016605, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ht2wrs/my_husband_and_i_have_been_hit_with_a_whirlwind/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438829.8265781, "replies_charged": false}
