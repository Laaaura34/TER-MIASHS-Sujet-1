I have a line of credit out, a car payment, insurance, and phone. I've been approaching zero almost immediately after I get paid every other week.\n\nWell, today I sold my tool box (not because of debt, but because I can't take it with me when I move). That knocked out my LOC. Also, I found out while I was at the credit union, that my car payments are automatic, and I had been paying on my own on top of that. So essentially, I've been making double payments each month. It was my mistake, really, but now I'm paid out four months in advance.\n\nI also found out: If I don't have money to make my payments, the system will accept my advanced payment instead. If I don't make my payments until February, it's not counted against my credit score. If I do have enough money to make the autopayments each month, it still pushes the prepayments out. So, I found out I have a four month safety net on my car loan.\n\nIt's a relief when shit falls into place perfectly, and because I'm not stressing about that, I can enjoy myself a bit more and stop being so bummed out. I know work is a source of income that could have potentially solved this problem, but I hated going.
