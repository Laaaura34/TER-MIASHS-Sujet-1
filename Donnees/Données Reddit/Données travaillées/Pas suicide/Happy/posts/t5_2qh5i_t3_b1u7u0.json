BUT!!!!\n\non the day i am supposed to be fired, they get called on by the head director of the studios biggest project, and got the news that apparently he hand picked me for their team and refused to let them get rid of me, despite me failing the whole program.\n\nit turns out my drawing skill for paperless saved me, and during our tour of our official office space i was told by another director that the head director pretty much wants to take me under his wing and train me. he saw the little silly animations i was making in my spare time and really believed enough in me to give me a try. i owe him so much and i had to excuse myself as i was tearing up a lot\n\ni cant imagine being in the miserable hole i was in for months before this, and it feels so amazing to feel like i have some use again, and that people will believe in you for something that you\u2019ve always dreamed of doing", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b1u7u0/today_i_met_the_director_of_our_animation_studio/", "title": "today i met the director of our animation studio who singlehandedly saved my career", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "corporate_casual", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1552753486, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/b1u7u0/today_i_met_the_director_of_our_animation_studio/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442887.8494563, "replies_charged": false}
