Nice job!\" (the other half was graded by the TA)\nOver the summer I took a Comparative Studies class that focused on reading and reflecting on a single book, Capital by John Lanchester. Our final was to write a paper and send it in to the professor. He finally gave me some feedback, and finished off the email with \"...more broadly, your contributions this semester, especially to discussions, were not just thoughtful but incredibly lucid. It was truly a pleasure having you in class. Don't hesitate to keep in touch.\"\n\nIt's good to be in such a more positive place than last year.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1lqiyw/two_professors_just_boosted_my_selfesteem/", "title": "two professors just boosted my self-esteem!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "IndiGhostLobos", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 87, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1378325525, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1lqiyw/two_professors_just_boosted_my_selfesteem/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442246.7625918, "replies_charged": false}
