Fast forward 14 years to last Friday, I managed to get 2 tickets to a game for me and my dad.  I'm sitting at work right now, thinking about how in 4 hours I'll be travelling to St. Petersburg to see the 16th round of Sweden vs Switzerland and I can't concentrate at all, as I am way too excited. It's honestly one of the best days of my life ! :) (I hope tomorrow will be even better)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/8vhhur/going_to_fulfil_me_and_my_dads_dream_to_see_the/", "title": "Going to fulfil me and my dad's dream to see the world cup live tomorrow and I couldn't be happier right now", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "savadgze", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1530526036, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8vhhur/going_to_fulfil_me_and_my_dads_dream_to_see_the/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440968.1431072, "replies_charged": false}
