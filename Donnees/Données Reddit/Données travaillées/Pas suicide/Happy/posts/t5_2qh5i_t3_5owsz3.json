He didn't talk down to the boy. He never corrected him. He did not care one bit about winning. In fact, when he saw a good move, he was genuinely thrilled about where that might lead the game.\n\nWhen the boy made a move that was probably dubious, the man would say \"Interesting choice. Now, let's figure out what might happen next. I might do this, and then this, and then this... So, let's figure out together how you could position your pieces even better?\"\n\nIt was not like they were playing a game against each other, but just having fun together over their game.\n\nIt was truly inspiring, and the boy seemed to absolutely love every single bit of it. I would like to see way more things like that!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/5owsz3/i_had_the_pleasure_of_witnessing_a_master_teacher/", "title": "I had the pleasure of witnessing a master teacher", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "betlamed", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 24, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1484835673, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5owsz3/i_had_the_pleasure_of_witnessing_a_master_teacher/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442216.033395, "replies_charged": false}
