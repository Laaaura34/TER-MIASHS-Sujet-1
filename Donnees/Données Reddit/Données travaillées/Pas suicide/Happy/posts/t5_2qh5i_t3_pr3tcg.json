All my life he has given me the latitude to chart my own course in life and when I decided what I was going to do, I promised I was going to make him proud. Recently I\u2019ve worked hard to put together the perfect little life by the sea I\u2019ve envisioned for myself and so much of it is clicking. My businesses are going strong, I\u2019ve made a good number of friends already, found a mentor, and have been given some truly amazing opportunities.\n\nI guess I had finally done enough that he get I deserved to do hear what I had promised him. There was a reason I chose to go to the same college he did and my grandma did, the legacy I know I follow in. It means the world to me to know I\u2019ve managed to bring him the honor he deserves.
