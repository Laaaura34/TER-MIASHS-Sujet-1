From awesome friends to amazing family, to landing a killer career and a beautiful wife. Whatever you want to call it- blessing/fortune/luck- it's been one helluva ride.\nBut I've very recently discovered that while I've been living a happy and satisfying life, I haven't been living happy. Day to day is routine, my love for others has been in my words and actions. But something was missing. The emotional component.\nMaybe a dozen or two times in those 15 years has that emotion flowed through me. Then, probably triggered by the ending of the TV show TGP, I dug for that emotion. I found it. Waves of joy. I gave a family member a hug and not only *said* I loved her, but expressed it, felt it. I did the same with my roommate. Then my wife. \n\nWith some work, I hope to keep this flow going.
