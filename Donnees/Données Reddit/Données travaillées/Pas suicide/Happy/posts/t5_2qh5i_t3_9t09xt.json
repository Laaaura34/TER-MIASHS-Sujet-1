I am really excited of how we'll be spending our lives together that I not only will get to be with my favorite person but he has also expressed the same feelings for me. I am excited to cook for him, take care of him, and make him feel loved everyday! That we'll get to fulfill our dreams and late night talks about building our own family having imaginary scenarios to which we pretend to have the stereotypical arguments of husband and wife. We have been dreaming of how we'll raise our kids and how we pretend to force them the dreams we didn't get to do when we were young. Lol. I am so much in love with him, loving him more each and everyday. To God be the glory!! God bless everyone!\n\nEdit: It'll be 3 years on the 26th since we have joined as one. Today, I'm 5 months pregnant with our first child. \ud83d\ude0a", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/9t09xt/5_days_ago_i_married_my_best_friend_and_i_am/", "title": "5 days ago I married my best friend and I am still feeling the overwhelming happiness.
