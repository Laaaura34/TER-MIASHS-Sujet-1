The last straw was when my fiance told him to let me know (twice) what's going on but I didn't get anything at all. So I calmed my broiling self down and spoke to him over the phone, he gave me some BS about not having my number (we have texted each other!!) and I wanted to rip him a new one.\n\nI usually don't like talking over the phone and confrontations are a bit scary but this was the day. I knew it when I woke up. No more bullshit. And I did it! I feel empowered and happy :D This will be a day remembered for being brave and knowing I have it in me", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/nwxt5s/i_stood_up_for_myself_and_im_so_happy/", "title": "I stood up for myself and I'm so happy!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ButterCreamedWaffles", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623357385, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nwxt5s/i_stood_up_for_myself_and_im_so_happy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439296.570373, "replies_charged": false}
