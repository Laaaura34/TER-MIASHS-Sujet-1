I was fired from my job two days ago( they didn\u2019t offer a reason) and didn\u2019t have plans of moving for another two years. When that happened I had the biggest urge to just say fuck it and drive down. Well today it\u2019s happening, it\u2019s a 20 hour drive but I plan on extending it by enjoying the trip and exploring each state. I\u2019m very happy and excited. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hsgrud/leaving_earlier_than_planned_excited_as_ever/", "title": "Leaving earlier than planned, excited as ever.
