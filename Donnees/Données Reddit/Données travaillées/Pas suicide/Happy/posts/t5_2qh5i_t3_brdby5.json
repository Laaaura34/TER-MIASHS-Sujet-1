I've tried some of the online streaming things when my country has been playing but the quality is usually very poor and the connection breaks and so on. Not a pleasant experience.\n\nAnyway recently I stumped up and paid for the games my country was playing but money is always tight. \n\nI've been dreading even finding out about The Rugby World Cup coverage because of the cost. I want to watch all the games if I can.\n\nTook a deep breath and searched it up just now \u2014 it's on terrestrial TV (and their free streaming players)!!\n\nI am absolutely stoked and since my family isn't too bothered about rugby one way or the other I just had to tell someone.\n\nI know it's silly but, if you've managed to read this far, thanks.
