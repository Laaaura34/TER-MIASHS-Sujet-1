She's so wonderful and accepting and gives me my ~space~. My sister got married a few weeks ago and she couldn't be there(i'm not out with my family yet, maybe never) but it was so wonderful to see my baby sis so happy and I love my brother-in-law so much. Love seeing my family grow. Can't wait until they have their first kid!\nI'm so grateful for how things turned out in my life and that everyone in my family is happy, healthy and prosperous. I've been working in the film & tv biz for ten years and I love seeing all my friends succeed and have a career-- one friend sold his film to a distributor after struggling for 15 years in Hollywood. I LOVE THAT! I love my friends(old and new)! We are all blessed and every day I wake up happy. Life is great and the future is exciting. I just want to scream \"Be happy everyone\"!
