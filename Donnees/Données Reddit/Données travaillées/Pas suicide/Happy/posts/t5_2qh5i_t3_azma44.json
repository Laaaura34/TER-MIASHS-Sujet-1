This new client is great because I can drive instead of flying (no packing limitations or life dictated by airline schedules!), it\u2019s in the suburbs by a university so the hotel is nice yet cheap + I\u2019m surrounded by tons of good food and retail, and they have fitness studios that participate in an app I have so I can attend their classes for very low cost and stick to my workout routine!\n\nTraveling for work always sucks but I\u2019m feeling optimistic that I will be pretty happy in this situation. Big cities are cool but being a quasi-tourist with a per diem in an overpriced area gets old; tiny towns are very cheap but have no selection.
