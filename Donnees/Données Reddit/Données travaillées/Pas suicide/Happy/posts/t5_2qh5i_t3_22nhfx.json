I was also fortunate enough to receive a full ride scholarship and stipend to attend this master's program.\n\nSince I am scheduled to officially graduate this spring, I applied for my first job. I heard back from the company today, and they gave me an official job offer! All of this exciting news has had me realize that, while I had many moments of struggle over the past 6 years, I kept pushing forward. If it wasn't for my dedication and supportive family/friends, I wouldn't be where I am right now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/22nhfx/happy_to_land_a_job_and_not_be_in_debt/", "title": "Happy to land a job and not be in debt!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jdietrich26", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1397088488, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/22nhfx/happy_to_land_a_job_and_not_be_in_debt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440886.2199562, "replies_charged": false}
