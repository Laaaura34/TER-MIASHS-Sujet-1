I have 2 midterms worth 30% each and then a 40% final exam, and I already failed a  different psych course with the same professor. After writing my second midterm, I was convinced I was gonna fail, and for days would lie awake stressing about how I\u2019m gonna work to come up with another $700 for to retake the course because I\u2019m broke. I got a 60% on the midterm!! I am elated!! On the first one I got a 53%, and all I want is to pass this course. Not only that, but I am so happy and proud of my recent writing skills. My TA for my philosophy course loved my thesis, and I\u2019m looking forward to receiving my mark. I wrote my last paper of the semester yesterday, and my bf edited it and left me notes on how to improve it, and I am so grateful because he has such a knack for literature and constructing proper essays. I\u2019m just so happy, my semester is coming to an end as well.
