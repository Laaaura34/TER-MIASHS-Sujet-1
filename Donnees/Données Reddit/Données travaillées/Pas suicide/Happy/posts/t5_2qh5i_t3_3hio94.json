I was with X for four years, we got together when I was 18 and he was 24. At first, it was exciting, fun, interesting. He was smart and charming and intelligent. We had conversations I hadn't been able to have with people before in reality (read: Super internet nerd), having been socially estranged and a shy, nerdy kid with severe depression. I'd never really had any friends that weren't from the internet before.\n\n\nI ended up leaving him about four months ago because he'd started emotionally abusing me to the point where even my rose-tinted glasses couldn't cover it up. \"Oh he didn't mean it, he just said it in anger\" etc. I cried and apologized to him when I left him, and was honestly quite hurt by a couple of passive aggressive digs he got in while I did so.\n\n\nA couple months later, after a month and a half of depression at the end of the relationship that I was \"Going to spend the rest of my life in\", the rose tinted glasses came off. I started seeing the relationship for how it had been. At 18, having spent a year and a half bedridden from illness, I was young, immature, and honestly quite naive. I hung on his every word and he *loved* that. I took everything he said in, and looked to him as if he hung the moon and stars. Here was a cultured, handsome, intelligent older guy who for *some reason* thought I was worth his attention... and he supported that mindset.\n\n\nI didn't realize how often he put me down, even before I realized he was emotionally manipulating me. He would dismiss my opinions because I was younger than him and \"clearly didn't understand how things worked\", and eventually it got to the point where he was severely gaslighting me. Trying to convince me that he wasn't mistreating me, that I was so insecure that it was colouring the things he said to me. At that point in time, I was severely ill. We were living together, and he was pretty much the only person I saw. I trusted him, and believed him. Before we lived together, eight months into the relationship, he cheated on me. He gave some bullshit excuse I can't even remember anymore, and it definitely left a mark that I'm going to have to work to get passed so it doesn't effect any future relationships. That was his basis for my insecurity - and he was right, I was just insecure enough to believe him.\n\n\nIt wasn't until I was physically well enough to go out to dinner with some mutual friends that I realized it wasn't in my head. Said friends immediately came to my defence when he made some remarks, that to me were fairly regular, and I ended up speaking to them afterwards asking \"Wait, so if X isn't just in my head, what about him saying X, Y and Z? That's NOT just me being a crazy insecure person?\". He'd warped my head slowly over such a long period that I wasn't even able to tell if I was right or not about things. \n\n\nIn the end, it turned out he was the one with no fucking clue on how the world worked. As I grew older and started to come into my own we began to fight more regularly - the beginning of his more prominent attempts to put me down and control me. Due to love, illness and sheer exhaustion... I let him. I stopped fighting because I was so sick and tired and just wanted to be able to have him come home and not fight with him over stupid shit. Then I started to listen to him, and eventually I lost myself to that relationship. On the flip side, I started to cut myself off from him emotionally. He pushed me too far, and once I had my (physical and emotional) strength back, I shoved back. I told him I wouldn't accept that kind of treatment. I made the silly mistake of giving him a chance, and hurt myself more trying to help him with his sudden \"depression\" after I moved out while he copped the fuck on. Minding his cat that he was neglecting, going back to our apartment nearly every day to do so, staying because he was \"lonely and sad\". Nearly wrecking my newly restored health to take care of him and his shit because he was a giant man-child that fell apart without me.\n\n\nI find it rather amusing now that he always said he did everything around the apartment, considering how fast it turned into shit once I left.\n\n\nIn the end, I'm almost glad for that relationship though. There were some beautiful times, and at the end of the day he's not an evil or bad person. He's just got some serious control and other issues. He was a bully, putting me down so he'd feel better about his own existence. He broke me, but I came back stronger. I'm still caring, tender, compassionate, loving, empathetic, but in the end it was him that helped me find my adamantium core. He taught me you don't have to be cold to be strong, even if it's easier to be.\n\n\nLiving in that environment for nearly two years tore my down. Due to a chronic illness it also effected my health. As I said, it's been about four months... and in that time I feel like I've blossomed. I feel like I can breath again, and be myself without worry of criticism. Let's just say it got to the point that when I took a calming breath during a discussion (when he said something ridiculous or offensive or what have you) he'd start yelling at me for always being on his case. (Oh I'm sorry, here I am trying to continue this conversation like a reasonable adult.)\n\n\nToday, I looked at myself in the mirror and *smiled*. I'm so used to looking and seeing a withdrawn face with hollow eyes, drained of everything that made me me. I was a hollow shell of who I'd been, and shit, the fucker even commented that I \"Wasn't the person he fell in love with anymore\". Not surprising, considering he'd sucked it all out. I let him, though. He twisted my love for him into a chain and used it to choke the life out of me, emotionally manipulating me into always feeling like the bad guy.\n\n\nI'm not. I may have been a bit of dickhead at times, like everyone, but at the end of the day I was just a human trying to express myself - and in those cases trying to express that he was being a prick and hurting me.\n\n\nWhen I looked in the mirror today, I saw a wry smile and eyes sparkling with mischievous humour. I felt the love I have for all the wonderful people I have in my life, I felt my strength, my resolve to keep on going no matter what. I've struggled with severe depression since I was a child, and honestly tried to kill myself a number of times in my teenage years. One day I realized, after my best friend killed herself, what that would do to the people who cared about me and decided I never would. That resolve wavered during that relationship. At one point I went on anti-depressants because I felt I needed the help, but apparently I'm one of those people who reacts really badly to them and I slipped up. I tried to kill myself and hurt my family and friends. I feel awful about that still, and rather angry that they didn't listen to my \"This medication is making me feel really awful\", but then again I've always had a talent for understatement.\n\n\nI used to get so nervous speaking to other people, new people especially, that my throat would close up. I'm still shy and a bit awkward, but just last week I managed to strike up a banter with a bunch of strangers at my local Comicon and left them all in stitches laughing and asking me to come hang out with them. I was so proud, my younger self would think I'm so fucking cool.\n\n\nI feel like finally, after years of trial and error, of pushing myself to overcome my fears and weaknesses, of slipping up and making mistakes, of learning lessons and my boundaries, I've *finally* become the person I was online and inside, but never felt like I could show the world. Haters gonna' hate, but I don't care anymore. \n\n\nI may still have depression, I may still have days where I wish that I could fall asleep and never wake up, but I love myself. I never thought I'd say those words.\n\n\nI hope that this helps someone, somewhere find some measure of comfort. Life can be a fucking cunt, but stay true to yourself. Listen to your heart AND mind, push yourself from your comfort zones, take (not crazy) risks, go on adventures, be the person you want to be not the person you feel you should be. People are always going to criticize you no matter what you do, and once that really sinks in it's much easier to ignore them. As long as you're not hurting other people, whatever you want to do or whoever you want to be is up to you. <3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/3hio94/for_the_first_time_in_nearly_four_years_i_feel/", "title": "For the first time in nearly four years, I feel good about myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Arithex", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1439943587, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/3hio94/for_the_first_time_in_nearly_four_years_i_feel/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439407.1627183, "replies_charged": false}
