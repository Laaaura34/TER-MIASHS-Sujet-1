I had a failing grade for most of the semester, which was REALLY bad news because I needed to pass this class in order to get into a calculus class, which I also needed in order to take a programming class. So if I failed precalculus, I couldn't take the calculus class or the programming class for another semester.\n\nSo I worked really hard to improve my grade. I started taking more detailed notes, doing homework more thoroughly, and going over old assignments. My test scores went from 45, to 67, to 71. \n\nFor my final exam, I started to study 3 weeks in advance. I would stay up late at night studying, every day, sometimes until 2 in the morning.\n\nThe exam was 2 weeks ago.\n\nMy results just came in. I passed the class.\n\nI win.
