I\u2019ve been on and off with working out since then. These last two months especially the past month I\u2019ve been too exhausted to do anything but go to school, come home, study then rest and finally I decided I needed to release some tension in my body and just work out. I have a test tomorrow too and usually I would use that as an excuse. I feel like I accomplished a big step in my journey to recovery. I don\u2019t know when the next time I\u2019ll work out is but from now on when I feel good I\u2019m going to take advantage of it no matter the circumstances. No excuses. After getting into all my university choices I finally feel like I can focus on myself for once. Lol to be fair it was only a 20 minute body weight strength training workout and a 10 minute stretch but I feel like I accomplished something at least ^ - ^", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fa1tj1/just_worked_out_for_the_first_time_in_2_months/", "title": "Just worked out for the first time in 2 months", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Kakashilife123", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1582756960, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/fa1tj1/just_worked_out_for_the_first_time_in_2_months/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438910.4105747, "replies_charged": false}
