About 11 years ago, I made a big purchase in the form of a $4,000 camera bundle. It slowly spiraled out of control after that with my credit card balance reaching upwards to $9k at it's peak a couple years back. But it is now done. I was stupid and it was my own fault, but it's still an accomplishment! Wish everyone the best of luck in paying off whatever debt you may have! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/7ge82k2wus771.gif", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/o8vyaa/just_paid_off_my_9k_credit_card_balance_i_started/", "title": "Just paid off my $9k credit card balance I started 11 years ago!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kingkhan13", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 151, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624796061, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/o8vyaa/just_paid_off_my_9k_credit_card_balance_i_started/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438932.4141, "replies_charged": false}
