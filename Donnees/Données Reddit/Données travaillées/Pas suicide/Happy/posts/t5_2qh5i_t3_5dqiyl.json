In order, I have...\n\n- Suddenly become a freelance web designer via my mom's recommendation to a local real estate guy and builder of tiny houses\n\n- Somehow landed an interview for IT Student Assistant with next to no experience and a very cheerful cover letter (I did *not* expect that to actually work, it's been a good five months since I last got an interview and nearly a year since my last job)\n\n- Received some very liberating advice from a therapist about feeling taken for granted (namely that I *was* being taken for granted and it was totally not some sort of selfish delusion worth all of my guilt)\n\n- Dropped off a box of pasties (PAST-eez not PASTE-eez; food, not nipple covers) to a very friendly homeless camp near my campus.\n\nAll that said, I've also been in activist mode and am heading to a protest tomorrow - and that's all I'll say to avoid a potential political shitstorm on that, but all in all I certainly don't feel like an aimless, purposeless lump anymore. On the contrary, I feel like the bright-eyed, bushy-tailed college kid I was supposed to have been during the last couple years of slow downward spiral. So yeah, moderately good, fine.
