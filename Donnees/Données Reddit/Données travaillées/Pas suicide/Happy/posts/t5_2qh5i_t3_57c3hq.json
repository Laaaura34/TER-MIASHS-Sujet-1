I have talked with them on occasion but not regularly.        \n\nA few weeks ago, I noticed someone tried to mow Mr B\u2019s lawn but stopped.  I soon went over there & finished it.   More recently, I mowed it again and Mr B came outside to thank me.  He said that his lawnmower wouldn\u2019t start and his eyesight was failing so he couldn't see to fix it.  He said his gas weed trimmer was also broken and he wanted to get that fixed first if I would give him a ride to a shop.  \n\nI spent 3 hours with my neighbor, who is near my Dad's age of 74, running errands and talking in a coffee shop.  As for the lawn, I have some basic mechanical skills and felt sheepish when I learned that the weed trimmer only needed a simple part.  I had not thought to look at it but I readily offered to test his lawnmower.\n\nThis morning, we met at Mr B's garage and, after cleaning parts, making adjustments, and adding some oil, the lawnmower started on the first pull.  Mr B looked at me like I had just discovered fire.  His face was beaming and he vigorously shook my hand and patted me on the shoulder.  Fixing that lawnmower was a big ego boost for me and his happiness was so genuine that I had to share the story.  \n\nTL;DR: I fixed an old man's lawnmower and he was ecstatic when it started.  That made me feel awesome!
