For the past several hours, I've been doing my utmost to try and finish my physics homework, which I had thought was due tomorrow morning.  It was beginning to look like I'd have to stay up past midnight to finish it, and I was suffering from mental burnout.  However, I happened to notice the assignment says January 21, not January 20.\n\nThis is wonderful for several reasons: first off, the fact that I can go to bed at a reasonable hour tonight is quite fine indeed.  Secondly, the fact that I had the mistaken notion that it was due tomorrow got me to actually work on it today.  If I had been aware that it wasn't due until two days from now, I would have put it off until tomorrow, but due to the false sense of urgency instilled in me by my misconception of the due date, I actually got more than half of it done more than a day before I needed it.  Now, when I actually am coming down to the wire tomorrow night, I'll have much less on my plate.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/arr62/frantically_rushing_to_get_my_physics_homework/", "title": "Frantically rushing to get my physics homework done, I realized that the due date is 24 hours later than I thought it was.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Kuiper", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 78, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1263962931, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/arr62/frantically_rushing_to_get_my_physics_homework/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438833.6004083, "replies_charged": false}
