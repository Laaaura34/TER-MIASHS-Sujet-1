Today, I received the offer to become the director of a gallery owned by a world class photographer who has been an idol of mine for years. I've talked to him extensively at this point and he is wise beyond his years as well someone I connect with on a very deep level. This studio is just one of several he owns, but its location is in my favorite part of San Diego and he's even going to give me the autonomy to do things like make my own hours. The position will also fit nicely with my photography and there is room for a lot of growth in the future.\n\nI know this sounds stupid, but I have tears in my eyes thinking about it, what I have been entrusted with and where it can lead. I've been wanting a simple life with an apartment, a transition of sorts to change up my career and work, and a great gym to workout and shoot hoops. I now have 2/3 of these things and I am just so grateful. Today by far has been one of the best days of my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ppux26/i_received_the_job_offer_of_a_lifetime_and_i_am/", "title": "I received the job offer of a lifetime and I am blown away!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AdCompetitive2523", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631860495, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ppux26/i_received_the_job_offer_of_a_lifetime_and_i_am/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635443175.0527253, "replies_charged": false}
