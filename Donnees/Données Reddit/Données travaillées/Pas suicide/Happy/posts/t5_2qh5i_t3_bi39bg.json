I'm very proud of the fact that, while Cambodia didn't turn out to be the place for me, I planned, I saved, I researched, and I achieved living there for a while all on my own! For decades I just sat mired in depression and anxiety. \n\nNow that I'm back, I take so little for granted. So many things that I used to assume were \"normal\" and necessities were rare luxuries in Cambodia. I've come to value everything in my life so much more! Plus, I got a great job with a really good company! Problems that used to throw me into a tailspin I now view as temporary turbulence to ride through. Depression and anxiety no longer rule my life, and I have a sense of confidence and happiness I've never had previously! \n\nI feel like a new person, and my enjoyment of things seems enhanced. I can pin down why, but I'll take it!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/bi39bg/moved_to_cambodia_moved_back_and_now_have_a_great/", "title": "Moved to Cambodia, moved back, and now have a great job and a much better perspective on life!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Up2Eleven", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1556397061, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bi39bg/moved_to_cambodia_moved_back_and_now_have_a_great/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441316.920624, "replies_charged": false}
