I have moments where I\u2019m terrified that I can\u2019t do it mentally or physically but I\u2019m pushing on because I realize that fear is natural but I don\u2019t have to let it control me. \n    \n    Also I\u2019m starting an amazing new job next week in my industry that also aligns with my love of nature after losing my previous job. I nailed the interview so quickly that I was offered the job two days after!\n    \n    Lastly, I made it through the holidays without getting super upset over rude comments about my life path! Single and 34 years old, yes I know society says my baby window is closing but I just haven\u2019t found someone to share my life with yet. AND THAT\u2019S OK. \n    \n    For the first time in my life, I\u2019m actually excited to see what I can conquer in the upcoming year! Cheers to you all, who help me to see the happiness the world and thank you for letting me share with you!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ehspf9/cheers_to_an_amazing_new_job_hiking_through/", "title": "Cheers to an amazing new job, hiking through Iceland, and forging my own path", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "drift_off", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1577742407, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ehspf9/cheers_to_an_amazing_new_job_hiking_through/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439481.7054026, "replies_charged": false}
