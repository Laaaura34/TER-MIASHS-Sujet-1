At a sushi place! how awesome does that sound already! I scheduled an interview, and it went fantastic! It was my first interview so i was very nervous, but tried to act as calm and collected as possible, along with just being my bubbly friendly self! We talked like normal friends would talk, and got along great! i made sure i took note from fellow redditors to ask questions, and not be the only one being interviewed. \n\nAnd two days later, i got a call asking for me to come in the next day to start training! Oh my sweet flower nectar of the almighty gods, have they spoken! I never get this kind of good luck!\n\nBut a few weeks ago i had a euphoric moment and from then on, i have been a new person, and had a whole new aspect on life and myself and i've held my head high with a positive attitude, and it's true what they say...good things come to those who wait, and if you keep your head held high and have a positive attitude, good things will also come to you.\n\nI'm so excited for my first day tomorrow, i hope i'll be able to sleep tonight!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1a9g8h/first_interview_for_an_awesome_job_and_i_got_it/", "title": "First interview for an awesome job, and i got it!!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Nudissst", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1363230685, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1a9g8h/first_interview_for_an_awesome_job_and_i_got_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440669.032592, "replies_charged": false}
