Dynn does these like reverse rants  where she just talks about how cute some things and characters from the  games she sees are, and man for the first time in my life really, i can  join in! And so i just have a blaaaaaaast talking to her about cute  stuff. AND IF YOU THINK THATS ALL, then you  will be surprised because she not only does all the cute stuff, but she also helps me chill when i'm agitated and she helps me relax when i'm scared :DDDD.
