When I was a kid both of my parents were pretty severe alcoholics that ended up getting divorced and stayed alcoholics for a very long time. It was hard. I took care of my younger sister a lot, we went to soup kitchens a lot, it sucked. I\u2019m not mad at my parents or anything, I\u2019ve dealt with those feelings and at least understand why they were like that. But I had gotten so used to taking care of myself and others because that\u2019s pretty much all I knew. I was dumb and married a guy who basically wanted a mom forever. I worked, he stayed home and did nothing. I cleaned the house, grocery shopped, cooked, managed the bills and whatever else. After realizing that he was not going to change and I deserve better I ended our relationship. For the next few years it was me handling everything in my life and that\u2019s fine. \n\nAfter my spouse and I had been together for awhile he relocated to where I lived and it took a few months to find a job. He managed the house in the meantime so that was nice. He got his dream job and everything has been great. \n\nNow I\u2019m getting laid off. Unemployment isn\u2019t nearly as much I make at my job and there\u2019s no time frame for when the lay off will end. I feel like I have to jump into action and get this handled by myself ASAP because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done out of necessity. Finding a job that pays well enough in the industry that is doing the lay offs is not an easy task so I\u2019m panicking. I\u2019m not going to make enough money. I\u2019m so fucked. \n\nCue the good spouse. I\u2019m venting to him about my panic and he nonchalantly tells me \u201cdon\u2019t sweat it. We\u2019ll get through this just fine. Together.\u201d And he means it. He\u2019s ok with picking up my slack because that\u2019s what partners do. It feels so good (and so foreign) to actually have someone I can rely on. Someone who can and will actually help. For the first time in so long I feel like I\u2019m not handling life alone and it\u2019s comforting.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/esf8ob/im_getting_laid_off_at_my_job_this_week_but/", "title": "I\u2019m getting laid off at my job this week but everything is going to be ok because my spouse is a wonderful partner.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "yellingsnowloaf", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 59, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1579714379, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/esf8ob/im_getting_laid_off_at_my_job_this_week_but/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440613.225244, "replies_charged": false}
