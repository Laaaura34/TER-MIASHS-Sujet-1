I live in FL and our job situation is beyond fucked and our housing costs in relation to income are ridiculous and I am the sole breadwinner in my current living situation (unemployed for 4 months boyfriend).  I have 2 months until financial aid hits again, 1 month until classes start so I'm getting nervous as the project I'm doing for a local non-profit is supposed to end next Tuesday.  I'm even more worried because I've been applying for jobs the whole time I've been working here with the goal of finding something for once this is over and I've had one interview that would have paid $8/hr for an experienced administrative coordinator.\n\nToday, the CEO (my direct supervisor as I work autonomously) just found me another project despite budgeting issues so I'm on board for at least another month.  Yay, I will be able to continue keeping a roof over my head!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/iu5pw/im_employed_for_at_least_another_month_yay/", "title": "I'm employed for at least another month.
