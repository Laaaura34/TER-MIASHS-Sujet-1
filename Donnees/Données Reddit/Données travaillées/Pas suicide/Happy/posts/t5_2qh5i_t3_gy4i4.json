In the last 2 weeks alone, I've got 3 job offers from people at work because my contract was ending at the end of April. I just accepted one of them, which gave me a really nice 20% raise, and now I've been offered an even better position that is basically my dream job.  \n  \nIt's just really great to know that the work you're doing has been noticed, and to know how in demand I am is far beyond my expectations.  \n  \nSecondly, I've had a girl basically telling me to ask her out recently. We still haven't found the time, but it was definitely an ego boost to have that happen. I was being my usual oblivious self so she had to really make it obvious she wanted me to ask her out.  \n  \nLastly, it wasn't anything I did, but I'm a proud new uncle recently, which makes the third one in less than 18 months.  \n  \nTL;DR; I've got a new job, with an awesome raise, and possibly an even better one in the next couple of weeks. A beautiful girl has been making advances towards me. I've got a new nephew.
