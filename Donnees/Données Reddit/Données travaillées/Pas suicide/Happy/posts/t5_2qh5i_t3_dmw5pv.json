My mentor. \nWherever we went, she would almost always find a penny on the ground and declare with childlike  wonder \u201cthere\u2019s my lucky penny for today!\u201d  \n\nRecently I was really afraid my needed surgery would find something bad. The night before it, I went to a store and on top of the hand sanitizer box at the store\u2019s entry were two very shiny pennies. \n\nI knew they were meant for me from my grandmother. I wasn\u2019t able to bend to the ground so she had them placed higher for me. Double shiny reassurance to me that I would be ok.   She must have pulled some heavenly strings to do that for me.  I felt so filled with love. \n\nStart looking for your lucky penny each day and know an angel is sending you love and protection. \ud83d\udc95", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/dmw5pv/spiritual_grandmother_reassured_me_before_my/", "title": "Spiritual grandmother reassured me before my surgery", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "detafth", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1572003247, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/dmw5pv/spiritual_grandmother_reassured_me_before_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441440.6207213, "replies_charged": false}
