One member made this holiday extra special for me, my 20 month old nephew. I've tried to take part in my nephew's life when I can. I've had the pleasure of watching my sister and brother-in-law become parents.\n\nOver the past few weeks they had been trying to teach him to say \"Ty-Ty\"(my name is Tyler), and he was actually able to pronounce it pretty well. The day before we met up for Thanksgiving, apparently my sister and brother-in-law had been saying things like, \"You're going to get to see Ty-Ty today!\" to my nephew, building up the anticipation. Well when I finally arrived at our get-together and was able to see him, all I heard was \"Ty-Ty, Ty-Ty!\" He was so excited to say my name to me and for me to be in his presence. I've never felt like that before and it made me feel very wanted and special. I enjoyed every second of it.\n\nAfter our festivities were over I returned home, and if I ever thought about him, I couldn't help myself but to smile. I don't have kids and I don't know if I ever will, but my nephew is someone that is very special to me, and he makes me very happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/a0nxas/i_was_made_a_very_happy_uncle_this_past_week/", "title": "I was made a very happy uncle this past week.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sennius", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1543268724, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a0nxas/i_was_made_a_very_happy_uncle_this_past_week/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442244.937324, "replies_charged": false}
