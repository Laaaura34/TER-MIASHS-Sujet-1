And just in time, because my friend who lives in france just got a baby, so my twin and I decided to go there by car! I'm absolutely delighted. I'm looking forward to it :) I like being with my twin, and I'm going to see two good friend who I haven't seen for a long time, and their kid!\n\nEdit: I found more reasons to be happy. My boyfriend is the cutest. This morning I kissed him goodbye, and he pulled me in for one more, longer kiss because he didn't like me going away. It was so cute. \nI'm also on my way to a good friend I haven't seen for a while, so I'm happy about that.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/q76k1k/i_got_my_driverslicense_and_im_going_on_a_trip_to/", "title": "I got my driverslicense and I'm going on a trip to france soon with my twin!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "new-wholesome", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634112823, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q76k1k/i_got_my_driverslicense_and_im_going_on_a_trip_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440215.4129696, "replies_charged": false}
