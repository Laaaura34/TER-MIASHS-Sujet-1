I wrote a pretty bad midterm yesterday which has really been making me feel anxious while I await my results, and I\u2019m especially nervous since I already failed the first midterm despite studying my hardest. I cried for hours after writing it. I\u2019ve been feeling like my best isn\u2019t good enough and it\u2019s difficult to see others succeed around me while I haven\u2019t been getting the same results. I\u2019ve resorted to smoking every night and getting high because it helps numb my emotions, and gives me something to look forward to. I received another midterm mark today and I got a B-!! Even though it\u2019s not an exceptionally good mark, I am so damn happy I\u2019m seeing something other than D\u2019s and C\u2019s. I\u2019m gonna be riding this happy high all night and be productive and get as much of a paper done that\u2019s due on Monday. I\u2019ve decided to stop smoking for now because I realize it\u2019s not a good coping mechanism at all and I hate being dependent on it. Gonna remain optimistic as possible and just get these next few jam packed weeks out of the way before exams. Just had to write this down because I\u2019m proud of myself and I haven\u2019t been proud of myself in months.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ds5wxf/feeling_the_best_ive_felt_since_starting_my_third/", "title": "Feeling the best I\u2019ve felt since starting my third year in university.
