I've been doing this for more than 7 years.  Time after time, I apply for management positions and I've always been told that the reason I don't get promotions is because i am better suited for direct care.\n\nOver the last year, I've been working on my management skills.  I've been more direct, handled client, parent, and staff complaints myself rather than defer to my supervisor, and worked hard to make sure paperwork is done correctly and on time.\n\nAnd now....I've been offered a management position.  And not just a few bucks extra an hour, but a massive increase....like, another tax bracket increase.  \n\nI'm out of poverty.  And I can finally afford to pay my bills on time.  I'm so happy that someone finally took a chance with me.
