Organizing a group of 35 people and teaching them the choreography every day after school.\n\nI even spoke to some teachers and principals in order to make sure the operation ran smoothly.\n\nThe day of the Flash mob I was so nervous. The moment  she finally arrived at school and saw her smile I knew everything was going to be alright.  \n\nWe danced to Jesse J Domino and had a blast doing it. The best part was that every couple seconds more and more people kept adding into the dance. Even a teacher who didn't know what was going on jumped in.\n\nI had friends hold signs asking if she would go to prom with me. When I asked she said.....NO and the laughed and said yes!\n\nThe flash mob went amazing except that my stereo started pausing ( Scratched CD probs way before your time kids) but she came and fixed it.\n\n8 years later I am still with her and we plan on getting engaged soon. Guess I have to come up with a marriage proposal flashmob. ;)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you all enjoyed, love is out there.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b9gt8h/when_i_asked_my_high_school_sweet_heart_to_prom/", "title": "When I asked my high school sweet heart to prom with a flash mob.
