In the middle of March my department shut down it's operations, but instead of being laid off they kept us on retainer by having us sit at home with full pay for 3 months. We've gradually transitioned back to work, I'm taking a temporary assignment in another department to help out while working remotely at home, it's been great not having to drive to and from work every day, not to mention cheaper.\n\nIt's really comforting knowing that if I didn't get in with the feds I would have taken a nasty hit financially, instead I'm just laying waste to my mortgage :).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ib3cd7/im_really_fortunate_that_im_one_of_the_few/", "title": "I'm really fortunate that I'm one of the few working class people not being negatively impacted by the pandemic.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Regnes", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597622139, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ib3cd7/im_really_fortunate_that_im_one_of_the_few/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440852.0211773, "replies_charged": false}
