Not a single person in my life has made me feel what she\u2019s made me feel. It\u2019s so overwhelming it leaves me speechless, not in any bad way, in a serene way that brings me peace. I love who she is, how she looks, how she expresses herself, how she thinks, her personality, how passionate she is about her interests, and how she treats me. I feel more valued, heard, safe, and appreciated than I ever have in my life. I want to grow with her and be there with her through the ups and downs of life. I want the best for her, and to be happy in life, and feel free to do whatever fulfills her. She\u2019s strong enough to do anything and I want her to know that and conquer whatever faces her. \n\nI can tell her anything and she accepts it with an open heart. She enjoys taking care of me. She checks in and cares about my mental well being. She respects my boundaries strictly as I do hers, and we express them fully so each other understands. She makes me feel like the most important and beautiful person on earth... I\u2019m extremely grateful the world brought us together.\n\nI love you planty", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ohxaoz/for_the_first_time_in_life_im_confidently_madly/", "title": "For the first time in life, I\u2019m confidently, madly in love with someone", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bac0n_cheddar", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625975559, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ohxaoz/for_the_first_time_in_life_im_confidently_madly/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440959.5499496, "replies_charged": false}
