Started with low back pain which has graduated/turned into a lot of pain in my hips and sacrum. I've seen a lot of physical therapists, a couple of back specialists, a couple of chiropractors, now a hip specialist. I've had a couple of dark moments where I entertained the prospect that I'd be in pain for the rest of my life. I'm not exactly sure why I had almost no pain today, but it gives me a lot of hope that I can go back to the days when I could lift, run, sit, stand, walk and dance without impingement. Man. I miss that. I miss exercising. But today was a good day. I danced and jumped around while listening to Anamanaguchi. I worked out. I felt the sweat drip off my body and the air fill and leave my lungs. I felt my heart beat inside my chest(the most heavenly of drums). I felt like I could fall in love with my body again, instead of feeling betrayed by it. Today was a good day.
