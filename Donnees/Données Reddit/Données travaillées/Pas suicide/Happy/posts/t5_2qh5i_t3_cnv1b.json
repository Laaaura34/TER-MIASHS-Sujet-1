Seriously, i feel all the stress being released.  There is nobody that can tell you want you need to do in your life to finally let yourself go and let happiness flood in.  Impressing your boss, following the path that your parents think is the proper way, or trying to be like those on T.V. with fortune and status is a sure way to forever feel worthy of happiness.  You are worthy and ignore those who say otherwise. \nTomorrow, wake and and do whatever you feel is the right way to live.  This may mean going to work, or it may not.  If you don't like your job, then start being frugal and find another way to get food on your plate.  If you feel you spouse or parents wouldn't agree to this, tell them how you feel and they should, if they deeply love you, accept that your entitled to live life however you want to.\nToday I'm Happy, Tomorrow I will be happy.  All because I am myself and totally fine with that.  Have the courage yourself, think of it as an experiment.  What's the worst that could happen?
