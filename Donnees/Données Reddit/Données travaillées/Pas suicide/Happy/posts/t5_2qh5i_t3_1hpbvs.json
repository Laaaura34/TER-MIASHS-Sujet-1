Yesterday he worked a 16 (overtime plus holiday pay!) and he got off a regular 8hr today. He decided to drink a bit since it's his evening. Kids at their grandma's for a week so I am sitting here in the afternoon getting delightfully buzzed playing Soul Calibur with my soul mate. \n\nHe makes me happy, and I love when we get to act like the young adults we are without worrying about responsibilities.
