They run a business that uses their farts to fly hot air balloons and go-carts. I pretty much ended every sentence with fart noises..\n\nI can't even tell you the laughter from them. Roaring laughter. It's easy to forget with all that's going on in the world, how deliciously funny farts are to kids (and adults).\n\nParent tip: Don't tell fart stories right before bed. They'll never go to sleep.
