We were in the same French 2 class and sat at the same table in 9th grade(2 years ago) for a short period of time before he moved up to the French 4-honors class (because he\u2019s from Montreal and is already fluent in French). However we did get along really well in 9th grade and I thought he was a great friend. After he moved up to the honors class I never got to see him until this year, when we landed two classes together, Literature and Art. Somehow we started a conversations 3-5 weeks ago and caught up a bit, and he said he remembered me! He speaks to me so kindly even now and he even restarted the conversation multiple times when it became silent while talking, and it honestly just makes my day being able to talk to someone so nice even if it\u2019s just for a few minutes. It really does keep me happy for the rest of the day and for days afterwards. I\u2019m so happy that I can finally be able to get along well with someone so warm-hearted I really am so thankful \n\nHaving at least one person whom I can look forward to seeing/talking to honestly makes me want to continue living and I\u2019m so happy I got to reconnect with him!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pna06j/im_finally_starting_to_get_along_with_someone_well/", "title": "I\u2019m finally starting to get along with someone well!!!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "iwanttodieallday_", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631514648, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pna06j/im_finally_starting_to_get_along_with_someone_well/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635443074.2946823, "replies_charged": false}
