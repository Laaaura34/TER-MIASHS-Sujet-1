We are doing a social distancing cook out at her house this weekend and she asked my opinion on things and if we had a table and cooler to bring for me and my fiance (except she refered to us as our \"household\" which felt good).  She also talked to me about how looking for a house is going but she still talked to me like an adult who knew what I was talking about! Then we talked about my childhood home and the HOA there and how awful the people were.  When I got off the phone I felt like a real adult!  I'll be 27 in June but she has treated me and my younger brother like children, I think, because she wasn't ready for her two youngest to be adults.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gbi7bf/my_mom_called_me_yesterday_and_she_is_finally/", "title": "My mom called me yesterday and she is finally treating me like an adult!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BadAnimalDrawing", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1588340151, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gbi7bf/my_mom_called_me_yesterday_and_she_is_finally/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440700.474881, "replies_charged": false}
