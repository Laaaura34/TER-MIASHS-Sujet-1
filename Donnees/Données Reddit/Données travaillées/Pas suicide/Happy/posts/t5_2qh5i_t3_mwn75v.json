I'm a remote technician, and the biggest customer in town has a contract that requires they have a fulltime tech here. But few techs with my skills WANT to live here. (I guess I shouldn't care, but it's just my nature.)\n\nOH! I'm also going to send out this \"Pirate Resignation Letter\" to my entire company when I give notice!
