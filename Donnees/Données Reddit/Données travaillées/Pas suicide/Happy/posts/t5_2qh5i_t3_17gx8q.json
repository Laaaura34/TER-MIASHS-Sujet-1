So the next morning, since there was no coffee in the house, my rabbi got up and went to Wawa and was waiting in line to get a coffee when a member of our congregation sees him and asks if everything is alright, because he probably looked a bit grumpy. And my rabbi said that he just had a bad night, so the person wished him a good day and said bye. Then when my rabbi was paying for his coffee the lady behind the counter asked if everything was alright and if something had gone wrong. And my rabbi told her that his kids had been up all night and they were acting crazy and he was having a bad day. And the lady at the counter looked at him, and in the most heart-felt voice said, \"I've always wished I could have kids.\" And when my rabbi got home, instead of being all grumpy and yelling at everyone, he told his family that he loved them all.\nI just thought that was a great story and wanted to share it with you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/17gx8q/this_isnt_exactly_a_happy_story_but_i_had_no_idea/", "title": "This isn't exactly a happy story but I had no idea where to post it and I think it gives a good impression on perspective.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "climb_like_a_girl", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1359425834, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/17gx8q/this_isnt_exactly_a_happy_story_but_i_had_no_idea/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442134.6279001, "replies_charged": false}
