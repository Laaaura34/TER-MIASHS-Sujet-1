But I was so torn up- I live in Vancouver, and she lives with my Mom and sister in Gibsons.  I was worried that she was going to die without me there.  I really just wanted to be able to be with her- she's been there for me my whole life.  I was crying almost every night after hearing my Mom's updates on how she's doing.  \n\nSo this is why it's happy:  I got removed from the schedule at work for all of next week.  I don't have to stress about getting back to the big city.  My sweetheart is able to cover me for lost $ if I need.  \n\nI brought some books, some journals, CivIV, the premiere of Caprica, and lots of comfort movies.  And here I sit on the couch, with my kitty sitting next to me, just so happy to be here with her.  Her purr is so soft I can only hear it when I put my ear right up against her soft, grey fur.  She's smiling.  <3\n\n:')", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/asoye/i_made_it_home_to_be_with_my_kitty_before_she_dies/", "title": "I made it home to be with my kitty before she dies!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Burlapin", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1264134819, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/asoye/i_made_it_home_to_be_with_my_kitty_before_she_dies/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442937.1667695, "replies_charged": false}
