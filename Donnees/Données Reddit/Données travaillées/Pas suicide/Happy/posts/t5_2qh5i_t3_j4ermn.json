That weekend an old buddy from highschool wanted to hang out. I'm pretty introverted, like I was social distancing before it was popular, but I decided to go out anyway, better than sitting at home depressed.\nHe ended up offering me a job, and I started that Monday. I've been working there since and am loving it. Most fulfilling job I've ever had.\nIn March I bought a new car. I've never had a new car only used pieces of junk, so it was a big step forward. Making payments instead of constant repairs is by far the way to spend your money on transportation. \nMy gf graduated 3 days ago. Well she graduated a few months ago but couldn't test due to covid, so just tested and passed a few days ago.\nWe got a house and moved everything thing in over the last 2 days, today will be all organization. It's quite nice for my standards, 3 bedroom, nice yard in a good neighborhood. I'm very excited. I feel like I'm finally becoming an adult, all because I decided to step out of my shell and go hang out with a friend I hadn't seen in a long time. \nI turned 29 today. I'm glad I was able to mostly get my shit together before I turned 30 lol.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/j4ermn/i_know_2020_has_been_hard_for_a_lot_of_people/", "title": "I know 2020 has been hard for a lot of people, buts it's been the best year of my life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BausofHogs", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 1550, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601730663, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/j4ermn/i_know_2020_has_been_hard_for_a_lot_of_people/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440966.5045407, "replies_charged": false}
