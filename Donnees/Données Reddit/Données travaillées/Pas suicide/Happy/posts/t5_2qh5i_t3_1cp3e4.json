I volunteer, I do sculpture, I work out every day. I love my life, seriously. My life is full.\n\nBut I met someone who I have pretty much everything in common with. Just enough in common to keep it interesting. He is hilarious, and handsome, and really really nice. Talking to him is as easy as breathing. We have a date thing tonight and I am just bursting with happiness! Gosh, he is so nice, and I have waited SO long to meet someone just like him. I don't have any expectations for where we will take things, but I just really want to have a nice time together and make him laugh.\n\nI am beaming :] sometimes you just get so happy that you feel like an eagle\n\n\n**AFTER DATE EDIT:**\n\nThe date went exceptionally well. We laughed the whole time, and we kissed and stuff c:\n\nI haven't felt this good in... ever. I am so pleased. I hope that everyone in the world can one day feel this good.
