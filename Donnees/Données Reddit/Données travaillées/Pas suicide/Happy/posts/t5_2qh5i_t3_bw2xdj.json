I landed my dream job in a totally different part of the country (we've been itching to leave here forever). Great pay, great benefits, great culture, exciting work. And all this after getting suddenly laid off after 6 months at my first job after college because of \"restructuring\". \n\nWhen it happened, I had a lot of debt that I was working to pay off so not much in savings. So the ensuing months were really, really hard on me and my partner. I must have applied to 100 jobs only to get dead air or no's every time. \n\nI had to WORK for this, guys, and it paid off. I had to learn a new programming language that I wasn't super familiar with just to interview. So for 2 weeks I studied my BUTT off. And it worked! I ACED the interview and landed the gig.\n\nWe're over the moon. And now we're off to start the next chapter in our lives!
