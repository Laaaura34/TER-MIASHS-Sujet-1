After nearly a year in a wheelchair, then an old-man zimmer frame walker, then crutches etc, I took up HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts - kind of like fencing but long swords, spears, sword&shield, etc) just under a year ago.\n\nToday, I competed in my first ever tournament, and I managed to place in the top 4 for Sidesword, and came second overall in spear.\n\nTotally and utterly stoked. I'm struggling with the weight (most of which is the result of not being able to move much for a year and I just can't shake it, but honestly I have struggled with my weight all my life) and basically thought I was too old and fat to ever do remotely well at such a very physical sport, but I found an awesome club with awesome and encouraging people, and I'm loving it, and doing a lot better than I thought I would.\n\nToday's a good day!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/6unpn8/despite_being_middle_aged_and_fat_i_competed_in_a/", "title": "Despite being middle aged and fat, I competed in a sword&spear tournament today, and did really well", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheAbyssGazesAlso", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 93, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1503126458, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/6unpn8/despite_being_middle_aged_and_fat_i_competed_in_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635443341.3274615, "replies_charged": false}
