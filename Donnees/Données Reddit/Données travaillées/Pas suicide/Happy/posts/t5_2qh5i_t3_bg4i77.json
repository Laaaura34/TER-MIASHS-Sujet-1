Last February I picked up a 2nd job at GameStop to make life a little more livable, money wise. I've spent the last year looking for a new job to replace the need for both of them, and found dead end after dead end. No one wanted to pay me anything that would be worth it. I was working 70 hours a week for what would be equal to $16.20 an hour at 40 hours a week.\n\nBut a few weeks ago, my friend dropped a line and said that his employer was looking for someone new and ready to learn. This job requires me to move from Cincinnati to Columbus and leave behind everything I've known for the last \\~22 years of my life to make over $20 an hour and actually be allowed to work overtime. And it finally feels like things are working out in my favor.\n\nThis is not a feeling that I've experienced before.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/bg4i77/i_start_a_new_job_this_upcoming_monday_and_the/", "title": "I start a new job this upcoming Monday, and the AutoMod cares enough to say I had a vague title and it had removed my post, which I am not happy about.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JakeALakeALake", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1555952539, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bg4i77/i_start_a_new_job_this_upcoming_monday_and_the/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440765.15019, "replies_charged": false}
