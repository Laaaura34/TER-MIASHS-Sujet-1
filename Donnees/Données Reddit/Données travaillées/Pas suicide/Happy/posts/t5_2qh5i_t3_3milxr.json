Here\u2019s how things have gone so far:\n\n-- When I weighed myself this morning I had finally broken through a goal in lowering my weight. I was now at my lowest in three years (going from a porky 239 to a \"feel good\" 221).\n\n-- Then when the mail came mid-day it turned out there was a decent sized check for me. The check had been iffy for a good while but now the money was actually in hand.\n\nAnd things got even better.\n\n-- This afternoon I played golf with my wife. To my utter delight I got a hole-in-one on a 159 yard par 3. Understand that I\u2019ve played golf on and off my whole life. I\u2019m 62 and have never had a hole-in-one or an eagle for that matter. \n\nAnd the day isn\u2019t over yet! We\u2019re going out to buy a lottery ticket now.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/3milxr/one_of_the_best_days_of_my_life_so_far/", "title": "One of the best days of my life so far!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Njncguy", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 143, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1443307211, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/3milxr/one_of_the_best_days_of_my_life_so_far/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440224.9318268, "replies_charged": false}
