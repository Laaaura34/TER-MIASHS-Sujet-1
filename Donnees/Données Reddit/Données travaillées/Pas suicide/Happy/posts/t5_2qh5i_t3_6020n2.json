I was so tired and so exhausted I decided to go 1 week without doing the worst one I had and it was the hardest thing in the world, I had been doing that compulsive act for 12 years. After the 1 week of so much hard work I bought myself an expensive charm for a bracelet, so I could always remember what I am capable of.\n\n I never thought I would make a full year, but actually I wouldnt have even known a year had passed if it wasnt for my Facebook memories! So last year I bought myself a statue of my favorite super heroine (Atom Eve) on my first anniversary so I could always remember how strong I am :D\n\nThis year I am going to give myself roller skates because I have always wanted them and  it will symbolize how I am moving forward with my mental illness like never ever before!! Im so excited I cannot wait to try them out :) \n\nI am so happy I am taking care of myself.
