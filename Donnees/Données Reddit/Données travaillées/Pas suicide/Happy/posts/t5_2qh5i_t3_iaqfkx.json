I feel like I get too needy and clingy so I actively avoided dating. I get really easily attached. \n\nLast week, I decided to check out a R4R subreddit after reading about success stories because it was time for me to overcome my fears. I sent a message the very first post I saw because she had really similar ideals and was in the same general area. I then waited for her response because I would feel weird messaging more than one person at a time...\n\nIt turns out, she lives very close to where I live.  We started messaging and eventually moved on to texting. \n\nI'm still anxious about messing things up with her, but there is one sign of good news: today, she deleted her post. \n\nI'm happy because it feels like she chose me out of everyone... \n\nThanks for reading everyone, I didn't know who else to tell", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/iaqfkx/ive_been_texting_a_girl_i_met_through_a_dating/", "title": "I've been texting a girl I met through a dating subreddit.
