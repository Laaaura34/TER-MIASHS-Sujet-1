If I created an RPG game where you create a character, and can level up the character by completing tasks that make you happier (such as meditation, deep breathing etc.), would you play it? I would develop the tasks with a team of psychiatrists. Although this idea may not be ideal, I want to find a way that I can help you out in some way. If you have any ideas feel free to respond to this thread.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/78b6ak/here_to_help_spread_happiness/", "title": "here to help spread happiness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pkfenway", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1508795526, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/78b6ak/here_to_help_spread_happiness/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441490.3920038, "replies_charged": false}
