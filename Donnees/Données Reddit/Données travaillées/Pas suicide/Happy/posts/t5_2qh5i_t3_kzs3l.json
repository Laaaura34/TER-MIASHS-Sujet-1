It turns out that I am now able to eat ALL THE SHELLFISHES!! Lobster, crab, crabcake (my favourite), crab dip (my double favourite), shrimp, muscles, clams, snails, EVERYTHING!!! I am going out for dinner and eating SO MUCH SEAFOOD!! \nOh and I am not allergic to grass, strawberries, dogs, trees, and molds anymore either. But that's just minor...CAUSE I GET TO EAT ME SOME CRAB!  NOM NOM NOM\n\nEdit: Moral of the story is you should go get re-tested for allergies if you haven't in years. You may be in for a pleasant surprise! I am still allergic to cats, dust mites, and birch tree pollen (I find it weird how that's the only tree) but I will take what I can get.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kzs3l/october_is_looking_up_i_am_not_allergic_to/", "title": "October is looking up!
