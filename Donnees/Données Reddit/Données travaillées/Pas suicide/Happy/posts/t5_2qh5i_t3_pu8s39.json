I LOVE my new job.  The people are so friendly, the patients are incredibly strong and wonderful people, the schedule is perfect (M-F 7-4 closed every holiday and weekend), the pay is twice what I used to make, and I'm doing what I'd only dreamed of doing.  I suffered through years of toxic relationships, soul-draining drug addictions, and major depression on the journey to where I'm at right now and it actually paid off.  I really can't overstate how happy I am.
