She mostly worked freelance online during that time, and even had to work part time at a fastfood joint for us to afford bills. I told her no pressure, these things takes time.\n\nThen one day, I got an email from my boss asking if I know someone who can fill a sudden vacant position. My wife fit the requirements and so I immediately told her about it. She said she wanted to try...\n\nA couple weeks later of crossing our fingers, she finally got the job and now we're working together!\n\nGranted, her workplace is at a different building, so we don't literally work together. But it's so awesome to sit next to her during our meetings, finding solutions to the same work problems, and it's fun to guide her how things work around here!\n\nOur next happy problem is learning how to handle the influx of having our household income suddenly getting doubled. We were terrible in handling it and bought ourselves so many expensive gadgets with her first official salary. We need to go to a financial literacy seminar or something.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jwa247/my_wife_finally_got_hired_after_being_jobless_for/", "title": "My wife finally got hired after being jobless for 3 years... and she became my coworker!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Inazumaryoku", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 47, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605677518, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jwa247/my_wife_finally_got_hired_after_being_jobless_for/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441304.5502255, "replies_charged": false}
