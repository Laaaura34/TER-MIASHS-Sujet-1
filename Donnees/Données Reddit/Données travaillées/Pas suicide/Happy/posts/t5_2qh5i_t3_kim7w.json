And from that point out we just clicked.\nHe is the most compassionate, giving, trustworthy, beautiful guy (inside and out) I have ever had the privilege to date, and I completely in love with him. Yes I have loved before, but this guy, this man has it all. And we may be poor as dirt, but money has never and will never matter to me. Besides I love our tiny house :) its cozy haha\nLove you CM", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kim7w/i_was_going_thru_hell_but_in_the_process_it_led/", "title": "I was going thru hell, but in the process it led me to my soulmate <3", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pokadottedsally", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 24, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1316262932, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/kim7w/i_was_going_thru_hell_but_in_the_process_it_led/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442442.8137448, "replies_charged": false}
