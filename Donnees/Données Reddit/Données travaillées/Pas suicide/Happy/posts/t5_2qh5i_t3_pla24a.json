The feeling looking at my diploma for the first time was indescribable. And here's why I feel it's all thanks to good karma.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was going through the drive-thru ATM and the lady in front of me (somehow) forgot her money in the slot - well over 200 $. I was broke, a few weeks from grad, and that money was basically a fortune, but I steeled my resolve and turned it into the bank teller. \n\nAbout an hour after, the Mets scored 5 runs in the bottom of the 9th to win and have been on a tear since AND this great fortune has arrived at my door.
