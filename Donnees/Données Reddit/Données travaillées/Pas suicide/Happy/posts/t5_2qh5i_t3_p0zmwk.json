They didn\u2019t even low ball me, it was just that I recognized that I got a call 3 hours after I applied, and only me and one other person made it to the second round of interviews. Also, I overheard that the other person messed up their in person interview time and had to reschedule. I knew they needed me (and I didn\u2019t let on that I needed them) so I was able to negotiate 10% more. I feel very proud of myself, and it\u2019s the first time I feel happy about life in many, many months.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/p0zmwk/after_months_of_searching_i_finally_found_a_job/", "title": "After months of searching, I finally found a job.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "theguywhoisright", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 20, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628508712, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p0zmwk/after_months_of_searching_i_finally_found_a_job/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439588.5016537, "replies_charged": false}
