We were wounded when we met, and on our journey together we've healed and grown. 3 years of love and friendship has made us strong, and with humility and patience we've gained wisdom. Yesterday I peed on a stick and today I'm a mommy to a tiny little baby in my belly. I told him he is going to be a father, and he gave me the grandest smile from ear to ear. He just can't stop smiling. \"We can do this,\" he said, \"We're ready.\" \nHe's right. \nWe are ready.\n\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for their sweet comments and offers of prayer. I didn't expect this to get attention, and it just fills my heart that you peeps got a smile out of our blessing. Much love to everyone who shares our joy, and when I pop this lil baby out, ill post a picture :) be prepared to see the cutest baby ever (next to your own babies of course ;D )", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/4rjz4l/just_found_out_yesterday_that_im_21f_carrying_the/", "title": "Just found out yesterday that I'm [21F] carrying the love of my life's [26M] child.
