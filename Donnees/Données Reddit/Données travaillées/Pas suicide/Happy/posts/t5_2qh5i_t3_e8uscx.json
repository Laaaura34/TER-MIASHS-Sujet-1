It\u2019s an intensive, 20 day semester with no breaks (except weekends I think). It\u2019s so fast paced that it\u2019s recommended you only take one class if you do the winter semester. I\u2019m doing it with my favorite professor, but she\u2019s very strict and really challenges her students, so I just gave me therapist a heads up that I may not be able to do weekly therapy.\nHe told me it\u2019s no big deal, he said he\u2019ll waive cancellation fees during that semester (so if I need to last-minute cancel because of class or projects, it\u2019s not a huge deal) and he said he can do shorter phone call check ins with me in the evening if I can\u2019t make it to actual therapy.\nAlso, while I was in day hospital, he did phone call therapy sessions with me in the evenings.\nHe\u2019s also super understanding of my transition and isn\u2019t judgmental of my goals (I\u2019ve had therapists judge me in the past for not wanting any more surgeries or being more androgynous).\nI\u2019m just so happy I found him and can work with him.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/e8uscx/my_therapist_is_really_cool_and_is_the_first_to/", "title": "My therapist is really cool and is the first to really work with me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mewiodas", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1576003702, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/e8uscx/my_therapist_is_really_cool_and_is_the_first_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440702.0092783, "replies_charged": false}
