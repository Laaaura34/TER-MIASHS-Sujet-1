That little voice in the back of my head that would break me down, tell me I'm not good enough? It's become nice. I've become my best friend instead of my worst enemy.\n\nIt all happened when I came to this conclusion: treat yourself gently, because the world won't. You can break yourself down all you want, and the world will still have no mercy. So be nice. \n\nDon't be complacent, but don't be a jackass to yourself. Make progress through encouragement, not pain. Treat yourself gently.\n\nI just wanted to share. I can't tell you how much this realization has helped me, and I think I'm happier than I've been in years because I'm not constantly bombarded by my own hostility. I love myself enough to take care of myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/3ienul/im_moving_back_for_my_junior_year_of_college/", "title": "I'm moving back for my junior year of college tomorrow, and I think I've finally reached a mental state where I can be happy with life and myself.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Tenterhook", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1440550339, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/3ienul/im_moving_back_for_my_junior_year_of_college/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439615.9639666, "replies_charged": false}
