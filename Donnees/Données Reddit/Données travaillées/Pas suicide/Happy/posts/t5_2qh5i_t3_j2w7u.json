For those of you not familiar with the Publix deli, they have a wonderful practice of giving you the first slice of whatever deli item you are getting. Anyway, I'm in line with 6 people ahead of me. The couple ordering deny their slice and the deli man holds it up and says, \"Would anybody like to try a slice of jerk turkey.\" I raise my hand and gobble it up happily. They then order their next meat, and again, I end up with the slice.\n\nThen the little old lady next in line gets a few packs of cheese and some deli meat. She doesn't want her slices and again the man asks \"who wants it\". I wait to claim my prize till I'm sure nobody else wants it. After what seems like an eternity I pipe up and say, \"Fine I'll take one for the team\" and again gobble those delicious slices.\n\nAt this point everyone starts laughing, and suddenly it becomes almost a game. Every single person in line ahead of me gave me all of their free slices. By the time it was my turn to order, I'd tried 8 deli meats and 6 cheeses, all of which were new to me and all because 6 strangers got a kick out of me stuffing my face.\n\nI'm still beaming from this, it made my day.\n\nTL/DR: 6 strangers let me taste their meat... yea\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/j2w7u/today_i_had_the_greatest_deli_experience_of_my/", "title": "Today I had the greatest deli experience of my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Leo_Spaceman", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 369, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1311912864, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/j2w7u/today_i_had_the_greatest_deli_experience_of_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438990.9050555, "replies_charged": false}
