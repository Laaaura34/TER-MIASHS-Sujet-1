However, I do have 10 years experience under my belt, and I consider that to be an equivalent.  \n\nA recruiting agency found a position for which they thought I would be a good fit, except it was a 3-month contract and possibly to-hire job. At that point, I was willing to take anything, so I agreed to let them give my information to the company, even though I lacked a few of the skills they required.\n\nAfter cramming last night for information about the required technologies and company background, I went in at 9 AM this morning for an interview with their HR rep and the VP of software. I must have left a very good impression on them. \n\n...because only two hours later, not only did they want to hire me, but they wanted me on *full time* and to start first thing Monday morning... for a salary that is **more than I've ever made in my life**.\n\nI'm so relieved right now.
