A very good friend of mine who knows about my problems invited me over after lunch and we spent the entire afternoon and evening in bed. I have never been able to go that long without worrying or stressing about something, but I got a blissful day in bed spent with someone I care about. This person and I are close, and they really care about me. That was very obvious today and it was amazing. \n\nI am happy, I feel mentally and emotionally healthier than I have in over a year, and I am on the Got Laid Parade. Hugs and kisses to everyone, because I am so excited. ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/2v22gq/i_just_got_laid/", "title": "I. JUST. GOT.
