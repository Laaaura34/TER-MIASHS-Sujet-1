The basic idea is to make the project work on a complete win-win basis for everyone involved.\n1. On our side, we'd travel to different destinations, recording it all on video, showing the amazing places, culture, and also learning a traditional dance originating from that place. We'd post videos and pictures and travel stories online. We'd also support local charitable projects everywhere we go.\n2. Anyone can get involved in the project in many different ways from talking about the project to actual help (more details in 'help us help the world' section, or this would run too long). Those who wish to will also be thanked!\n3. We hope to get enough followers to interest corporate sponsors. That way, they can support us and we would feature them/their products in our videos and blog.\n\nWe'd appreciate your support and feedback! The website is on www.maddawnchallenge.net and the About page (for now it's the longer project description, we'd eventually get a shorter, concise summary up) explains how it is all going to work.\n\nThank you for any suggestions in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/noyia/a_new_exciting_project_being_born_please_support/", "title": "A new exciting project being born - please support if you like!
