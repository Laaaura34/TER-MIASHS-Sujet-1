We are so much closer now and I'm honored to be there dad. They are really turning into great people, someone I'd want to be friends with who are there for anyone at the drop of a hat. I'm hoping to continue working from home but it looks like we have to go back in September. I don't want to go backwards and drift away from my kids again. Please help this dad by watching the videos we make together. If this goes well then I can continue staying home with my babies. I won't beg for subscribers because this is about more than that, but I won't tell you no either. Thank you, and please spend some time with your own kids. -- Dad of four from CT https://youtu.be/70a1XIng3to", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/np2pd6/it_took_a_pandemic_for_me_to_finally_realize_that/", "title": "It took a pandemic for me to finally realize that spending time with my kids is all I really need out of life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Vardalia", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 27, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622465522, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/np2pd6/it_took_a_pandemic_for_me_to_finally_realize_that/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442622.49881, "replies_charged": false}
