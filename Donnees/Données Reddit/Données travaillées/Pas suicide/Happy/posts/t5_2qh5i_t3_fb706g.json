It was a totally non threatening public live-streaming website. You could see a whole bunch of towns and cities across the world, for example - a part of Mexico on this random street you could just watch people live there lives. Anyone know what this is? I just think it was posted on here because sometimes watching people has a calming effect and I say this in the least creepy way I possibly can. If anyone knows please comment thanks everyone <3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fb706g/livestreaming_different_towns_and_cities/", "title": "Live-streaming different towns and cities?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bloodyapples", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1582949059, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/fb706g/livestreaming_different_towns_and_cities/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439358.8037167, "replies_charged": false}
