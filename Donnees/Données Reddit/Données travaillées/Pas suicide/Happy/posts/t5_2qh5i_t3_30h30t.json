I'd been dreading it, since I'd been focusing harder on another class while this one had been rearing up behind me like a Lovecraftian marine abomination and the final made noises like it was going to stick its foot so far up my ass I'd taste shoe leather, but I got them back and I actually passed all of my classes by some fucking miracle. To sweeten the deal, I was on academic probation after I fell into depression after being fucked over by a girl I really liked and failed one of my classes last quarter, and I am now not on academic probation any more! And to sweeten it even further, my ludicrously hard programming class this quarter is being taught at a sensible hour by a guy who actually knows how to teach, instead of at 8:00 in the morning by someone who basically only knows German, and on *top* of that, my parents finally agreed to help me build a new computer to replace my old one that's basically about to die! I'm so relieved right now, I feel optimistic in a way I haven't in three of the worst months of my life! Sure, maybe I won't be able to land a paid tutoring gig because my GPA still isn't that great, but who cares? I'm bringing that shit up this quarter, and the only thing I'll be spending any money on is a GPU upgrade for my computer in the summer, and honestly I'm flying too high right now to let that get me down.
