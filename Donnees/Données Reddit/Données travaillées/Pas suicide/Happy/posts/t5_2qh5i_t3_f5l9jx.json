I won't get into the backstory too much because it's a bit complicated but I had to kinda wait for him for a while and it was really hard, now we're over 2 months in and I've never felt so close to someone. I'm constantly seeing memes or jokes like \" having a boyfriend is cool because you can gossip to them and they won't tell anyone because they weren't listening in the first place\" that always seemed so crazy and I was tired of seeing shit like that everywhere. He is so wonderful , I always know if im talking he will listen, I always know he will support me, and hold my hand when times get tough. He is beyond beautiful in every way. The kindest person I've ever met, words cannot describe. I am so beyond happy and feel euphoric. Today he told me \" I don't know what the worlds gonna throw at us, but I wanna do it with you\" I love him so much. I am so truly happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/f5l9jx/my_boyfriend_makes_me_so_happy_i_cannot_even/", "title": "My boyfriend makes me so happy I cannot even begin to explain it, he is the love of my life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "justme24601", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1581996542, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/f5l9jx/my_boyfriend_makes_me_so_happy_i_cannot_even/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440664.626535, "replies_charged": false}
