I'm diagnosed Bipolar I, so sleeping doesn't come easy to me. I don't dream a lot, so when I do, I think about them over and over again.\n\nI had the most realistic dream I was playing the guitar when somebody approached me and we struck up a conversation about it. Then his friend, somebody who I admire so much, caught up with us. He is somebody who makes my heart, quite literally, overflow with joy. Everything seems to be positive when I think about this person. I would call him a role model. \n\nIn the dream, we hugged. It felt nice, it felt good. I could feel the happiness even through the dream. We didn't let go of each other. It got to the point where my knees began hurting (I suffer from chronic pain, and it's a recurring thing that happens in my dreams) and I had to sit down, but even as I did, we were still hugging each other. We didn't say anything, it was just a pure embrace. \n\nWhen I woke up, I felt like there was sunshine radiating in my chest. I thought about that dream all day. \n\nJust thought I'd share. Hope everyone is having a happy holiday season.
