I absolutely love it here and am enjoying it far more than my previous college. \n\nWith that being said I decided it wouldn't be a bad idea to try and get a job on campus to meet new people, get a better feel for the University, and to get involved more. I sent out application after application for job openings but they got filled shortly after submitting (I think it was due to the fact they were oldish openings and they probably filled them already) and today I finally had an interview for the presidents office of the University. \n\nI was the 1st out of 6 to get interviewed and was told I would hear back by the end of this week. They seemed to like me a lot and I'm pretty optimistic about it. \n\nEven if I don't get it, it's still one step closer than I was before.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b8dcx3/3_months_and_10_applications_later_i_finally_had/", "title": "3 months and 10 applications later I finally had an interview for an on campus job", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TaylorHabrock", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1554172799, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/b8dcx3/3_months_and_10_applications_later_i_finally_had/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441989.001424, "replies_charged": false}
