I have always been such a light sleeper, I remember when he first slept over I probably got 10 mins of sleep and now I can\u2019t sleep until I hear him snoring. 3 years later and it\u2019s like the first week of us dating. The good, the bad, the really bad; it\u2019s all so worth it.\nI wish I could tell my 16 year old self that I got a fairytale, that hours I spent infront of the mirror picking away at my imperfections would be the same imperfections that he taught me to love. I wish I could tell the 18 year old me in an abusive relationship that this is what love is like. That regardless of the fight, he values our relationship above anything, that he values me, treats me in a way that makes my world a little brighter. Loving myself isn\u2019t easy but loving him is, and with loving him comes being easier on myself. I don\u2019t need him to be happy, but being with him makes me happier. I used to be so angry at the world but then the world gave me him. \n\nThis is soft, and I should probably tell him this but Reddit will do for now. I hope everyone gets to feel this way about their person, even if people write it off as infatuation or puppy love, it\u2019s what makes life exciting, and everyone deserves that. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I was going to live this long, but everyday I\u2019m happy that I chose to live", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/majvsx/to_my_younger_self_you_got_your_prince_charming/", "title": "To my younger self, you got your Prince Charming!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "supertomatoo", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616407420, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/majvsx/to_my_younger_self_you_got_your_prince_charming/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439373.6776354, "replies_charged": false}
