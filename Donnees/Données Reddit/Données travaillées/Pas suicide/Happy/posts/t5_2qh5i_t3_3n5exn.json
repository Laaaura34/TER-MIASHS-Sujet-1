I had too many fears to deal with. Fear of rejection, fear of heights, fear of intimacy, fear of expression, fear of being judged by others, fear of success, and the list goes on. We all have many fears and anxieties because we grow up in a world that is generally full of negativity, at least on the surface. The news always broadcasts negative events because it's been proven that events associated with fear stick more to the human brain. Wherever you look around you, the world seems like a gloomy place and a source of fear, anxiety and disappointment. \nAnd you have to find your way through these fears to be able to enjoy the bright side of life. So as long as fear is present in your life on regular basis, it's impossible to find pleasure and positivity and in the process you become unconsciously a source of negativity to yourself and to those around you. I had far too many fears growing up, and I don't consider myself a unique case by any means because I know most of you reading this can relate.\n\nI have overcome many of my fears, and some fears I have yet to overcome, but one thing became clear to me: the only way to face the fear is HEAD ON. You can't think your way out of fear, you can't avoid the pain and suffering associated with the fear. Instead, you have to FEEL and BE one with the fear, and then do the thing that is scaring you anyway. Realize that we only know joy and happiness because pain and suffering exist. Fear is a major cause of physical, emotional, and spiritual pain. But on the other end of that suffering is Courage, Joy, and Pleasure. \n\nIf approaching a girl that you are attracted to makes you nervous and anxious, don't judge yourself. Instead, be completely present with that fear, feel the adrenaline pumping through your veins, then go talk to the girl and whatever happens, happens. You might make a fool out of yourself the first time, the second time, the third time, but as you keep facing your fear, that fear dies, and suddenly approaching girls seems like a normal everyday thing that you do.\n\nIf you are scared of heights like I was, go to the nearest skydiving place and make the 10,000 ft jump, and I promise you that your fear of heights will vanish and you will transform into a new person. Fears, irrational or not, can only be defeated through taking bold courageous action regardless of the feelings associated with fear. Once you face your fears again and again and again, the fear dies and you transform into a brand new person, full of courage, vigor, and life, and you begin to see life from a different perspective, one full of brightness, light, joy, pleasure happiness, and self-empowerment. \n\n[FEEL THE FEAR AND DO IT ANYWAY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aeqqm7k8kJQ)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/3n5exn/overcoming_my_fears_in_life_makes_me_a_happier/", "title": "Overcoming My Fears In Life Makes Me A Happier and More Optimistic Person", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Lean-N-Mean", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1443733464, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/3n5exn/overcoming_my_fears_in_life_makes_me_a_happier/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441978.681245, "replies_charged": false}
