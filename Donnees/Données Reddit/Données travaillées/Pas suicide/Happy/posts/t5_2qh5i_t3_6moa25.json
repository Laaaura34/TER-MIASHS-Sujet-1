Which isn't necessarily false. \n\nI recently realized that I have dyslexia, always have, and is most likely the reason why I needed extra help as a child and was never really able to grasp reading out loud to a class or to myself. It was always a shameful secret I kept, because who could possibly HATE reading? I genuinely never even cracked a book open during college, and I recently graduated.\n\nI am happy because I am now on page 100 of Stranger in a Strange Land. I never thought I'd even get this far. I'm learning to take as much time as I need to to decipher and reread. I'm so proud of myself and excited to continue reading.
