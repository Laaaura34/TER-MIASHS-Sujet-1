I took a risk, and tried to branch out into a new field, and although I had many, *many* interviews within a certain company, it ended up not panning out. :( I've been really bummed and worried as the last little bit of our money reserves is rapidly running out. \n\nJust today though, I received a job offer to a place that is RIGHT by my house (so no commute like lots of the other places I was interviewing for), I will have full benefits, and my boss seems like a fantastic woman who it will be a pleasure to work for. I am one happy girl right now. :D My stress has all but disappeared. \n\nedit: spelling", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1dgc7h/after_two_and_a_half_months_of_unemployment_i/", "title": "After two and a half months of unemployment, I received a job offer today!!
