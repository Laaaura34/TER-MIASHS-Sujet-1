The first company I didn't think was a great fit for me, but they were offering, not only way more than I was asking for, but more than I've ever made before and more than I imagined I could be making!\n\nI couple hours later I received an email from the recruiter I was working with from the other company, saying that we could expect an offer from them at any time. The problem was that I had asked them for the same amount as I had originally asked the first company, and the difference was about 25%. So I mentioned the other offer to the recruiter. And he said that he'd bring that information to the hiring manager.\n\nNow, I liked the second company a lot more. I didn't expect them to match the first offer. I probably would have accepted their offer if they had just gotten up into the neighborhood of the first.\n\nWhat actually happened, that I never expected, was for them to actually *beat* the first offer!\n\nMy background check came through all clear this morning, they'll be sending me my work laptop and other equipment later this week (fully remote, even after Covid), and I start next Monday!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/manmvc/ive_been_out_of_work_for_the_past_five_months_i/", "title": "I've been out of work for the past five months.
