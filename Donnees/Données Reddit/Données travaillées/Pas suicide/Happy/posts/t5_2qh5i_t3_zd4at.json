Which means a trip to Colorado for the in-person! I was freaking out all day over this, studying all day, and it wasn't even as bad as I feared. I could have probably done just about as well without the studying. \n\nThe interview was a pair-programming thing and except for a single poorly-named class, I did as well as possible. Even the interviewer told me I did well. Best. Interview. Ever. It tested my ability without all the bullshit. \n\nWhether or not I get a callback, I did the best of my ability, and that's a great feeling I had to share with my 46,019 best friends.\n\nUpdate: Got the 3rd interview! They're flying me out next week!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/zd4at/kicked_ass_on_an_interview_for_an_ideal_job_today/", "title": "Kicked ass on an interview for an ideal job today!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TopRamen713", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 31, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1346803061, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/zd4at/kicked_ass_on_an_interview_for_an_ideal_job_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441477.8137128, "replies_charged": false}
