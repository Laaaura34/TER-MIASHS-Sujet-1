I only have one kid so this was all new to me as well. Fridays session ended up in frustration for both of us. I could tell she wasn't having fun and I was frustrated with myself because I could tell I wasn't being a very good teacher. So Saturday I did some research and watched a few videos trying to get some tips to help her figure it out. Yesterday we tried again and she got it! I was running along side of her and let go for the first time and she calmly said \" I'm doing it\". I was the proudest dad!
