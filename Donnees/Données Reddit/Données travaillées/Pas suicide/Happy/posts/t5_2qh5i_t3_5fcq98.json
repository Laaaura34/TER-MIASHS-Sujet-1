Went after class to my usually hangout spot, the backstage of the theater on campus. Hung out for a bit, but a couple people started getting to a pretty heated argument over politics\n\nSo I ended up grabbing my bag and peacing out, and drove to one of my favorite coffee shops to relax. Now I'm just enjoying some good coffee, good music, pleasant atmosphere, and a couple people brought their dogs inside :) I'm so glad I decided to come here. This is just what I needed today.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/5fcq98/i_love_this_coffee_shop/", "title": "I love this coffee shop", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "godzillalikespie", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1480352220, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5fcq98/i_love_this_coffee_shop/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442186.746962, "replies_charged": false}
