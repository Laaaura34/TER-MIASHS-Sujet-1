I thought I'd be crushed, but she said no really gently, and I'm really happy I gathered the courage to try. I'm just happy that after keeping it inside for so long, I finally got the courage and did it. It doesn't matter even if she rejected me, I still feel happy and optimistic for next time I ask someone out.  So for anyone out there, don't be afraid, just gather the courage and do it. Yeah, it sucks if your crush rejects you, but at least you'll be happy you tried.\n\nUpdate: \nTwo months later and I regret it. She was a great friend and now I don't talk to her anymore. Don't do it people. Keep it inside you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/a26hsj/i_did_it_i_finally_asked_my_crush_out_after_so/", "title": "I did it.
