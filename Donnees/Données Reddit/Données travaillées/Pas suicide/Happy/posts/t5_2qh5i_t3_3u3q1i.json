He has had a dark spot on his lip for almost 2 years now and his primary care said it could very well be Melanoma (a form of skin cancer) we both panicked and cried and held each other and told each other it would be okay. About two weeks ago he went in for a biopsy at the dermatologist and they removed it. Just got the results back today and it was just a freckle! \n\nI believe all things happen for a reason. When we found out from his primary care doctor that it could be cancer, he quit smoking cigarettes cold turkey on October 15th and hasn't smoked since. I love him with all my heart.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/3u3q1i/my_boyfriend_does_not_have_melanomaskin_cancer/", "title": "My boyfriend does NOT have melanoma/skin cancer!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "roboccohurly", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 273, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1448387129, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/3u3q1i/my_boyfriend_does_not_have_melanomaskin_cancer/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635443335.487415, "replies_charged": false}
