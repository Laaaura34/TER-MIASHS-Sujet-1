I am wearing a tiny spray of both of them (working from home has many benefits that I appreciate, among them is the ability to wear a little perfume without bothering anyone).   I am sitting in a comfortable chair with my feet up, covered in a soft warm blanket on a sunny spring Friday afternoon, feeling rather grand and glorious because I smell very like I would imagine the Queen of Sheba would smell.   Gloriously warm sweet and slightly wood-spiced mixture of honey, melon, oud and cedar.    I am honored and humbled to be able to feel so lovely today: the weekend has only just begun and I have very little planned, and I am soaking in the beauty of this moment.   I hope you also have a wonderful weekend starting soon with time to relax, and that you can be fragrant or not as yours heart desires!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/me0ts4/its_friday_afternoon_and_i_smell_so_delicious/", "title": "it\u2019s Friday afternoon and I smell so delicious!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kgbubblicious", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616799781, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/me0ts4/its_friday_afternoon_and_i_smell_so_delicious/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442719.75432, "replies_charged": false}
