My district finally provided the iPad I pushed for with a communication app. No one believed she was capable of using a more sophisticated device (until now, she was using PECS, or pictures). I pushed, I knew she could do it. She has flourished in only two days. It's incredible. She was naming everyone in the room, she was telling me things she wanted, I've even started using it during her lessons for labeling items. Words can't explain the joy on her face, she grabbed me close and hugged me. I had to fight back my tears I was so happy. I had to charge the iPad for a moment, she squealed with joy when I took it back out.\n\nThe iPad I was given was provided under the condition that it is shared (I have 8-6 are completely verbal). Onto the next battle of getting her her own to use her voice all the time! \n\nI just had to share :).
