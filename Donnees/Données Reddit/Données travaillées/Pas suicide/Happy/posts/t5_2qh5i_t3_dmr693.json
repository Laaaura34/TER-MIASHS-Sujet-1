But I just want to say I\u2019m so goddamn happy right now. My son (he is 4 1/2) recently started playing smash brothers. He gets so exited about all of it and LOVES me watching him play. His commentary is so hilarious and the lessons I\u2019m able to give him about being a winner and loser are beautiful. Watching him be so excited and go through the same emotions of pure bliss is amazing. I\u2019m getting a little emotional just typing this. It\u2019s fucking rad to experience that hot again through his eyes. I\u2019m so blessed to be his father and just wanted to express this for some reason.
