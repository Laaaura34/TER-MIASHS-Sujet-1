It was only 2k, but to me, being a student, that was a lot. It feels nice to be able to have it all gone. Unfortunately, my cards were cancelled as a result of a lot of missed payments and whatnot, but I talked to a financial advisor and was able to get a secured credit card to start rebuilding my credit. I also ended up getting an RRSP as well to start saving for retirement since I think it'll benefit me even more being younger. :)\n\nIt just makes me happy and I wanted to share. Mind you, I have student loans of 25k coming up in a year, but hopefully I will be prepared for those when the time comes. I will *definitely* be celebrating a lot more once those are paid off, that's for sure. \n\nHave a great day everyone :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1qjqy8/i_just_had_to_share_i_am_officially_credit_card/", "title": "I just had to share: I am officially credit card debt free =)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "xracquellyy", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 353, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1384364190, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1qjqy8/i_just_had_to_share_i_am_officially_credit_card/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438948.7197738, "replies_charged": false}
