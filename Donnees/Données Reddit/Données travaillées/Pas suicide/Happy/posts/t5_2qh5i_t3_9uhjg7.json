The more I think about it, I\u2019m just so ecstatic in life, and I\u2019m in a good place finally. Not too long ago I was severely depressed. But, I finished the book, got a girlfriend, and started looking on the bright side of life. If anyone\u2019s interested in the book, it\u2019s available in ebook and paperback on Amazon, just search The Earth Beneath (Nomads and Runaways) and it should come up.
