She noticed and read my comment and she seems to like it.\n\nIt boosts my mood and I'm just happy (hope for her so too). I think this is a very great start for a new year. I like the possibility nowadays, though you can't meet your idols, you can try to communicate to them. I think this is a great thing. It is just a heart from her, I didn't expected it, but it feels so good.\n\nJust makes me happy. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/abfbyd/victoria_justice_gave_me_a_heart_i_know_its_not/", "title": "Victoria Justice gave me a Heart - I know it's not so special, but ...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TOOMtheRaccoon", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1546320021, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/abfbyd/victoria_justice_gave_me_a_heart_i_know_its_not/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439394.2533894, "replies_charged": false}
