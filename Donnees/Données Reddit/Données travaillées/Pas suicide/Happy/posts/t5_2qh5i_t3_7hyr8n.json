One year ago today I walked into a treatment center completely broke and broken, desperate for a new way of life. Like many addicts my life has become unmanageable, my addiction lead me to commit countless crimes against nameless victims, lead me to prison and decimated my personal relationships with friends and family. Every decision I made in the grip of addiction was wrong, except one, and I made that decision a year ago today. What I didn't realize was how drastically that decision would change my life. Today I have a reason to wake up tomorrow, I have people who love and support me and most importantly I can love myself, I've come to realize that I was broken long before I touched my first drug. If you're struggling with addiction I want you to know that there is a better way of life, you just have to make that one decision. I love you all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/7hyr8n/my_name_is_lifeadvisor_and_im_an_addict_today_i/", "title": "My name is LifeAdvisor and I'm an addict, today I celebrate 1YEAR clean and sober", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LifeAdvisor", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1512574152, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7hyr8n/my_name_is_lifeadvisor_and_im_an_addict_today_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440720.9030733, "replies_charged": false}
