I started dating a guy a few months ago, and I think he is totally amazing!  I fully trust him, which is an amazing feeling. He's also extremely affectionate and caring when we are together.  I feel like he is as committed as someone can be at this point in dating.  I love the time I spend around him and can't ever wait for the next time.  It is so different than every other relationship I've been in.  I hope it keeps going and going like this.  We went out last night and it just felt amazing to be his.  I know that might sound silly when I'm 30, not a kid, but I loved it.  I love his humor, his drive, his affection, his thoughtfulness, and the way we get along.  I'm going to get redundant here, but I just needed to get it out.  I feel like I've made my friends listen to me gush as much as I can possibly expect them to listen, but it still doesn't feel like enough.  Thanks for giving me a place to release all these happy feelings!
