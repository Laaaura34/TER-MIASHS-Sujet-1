But this morning is my first day off of work for the holidays, and even though I know that a weight gain would make me depressed about every piece of food I eat over the holidays, I decided I should just go ahead and see how bad things have gotten. Who knows, an extra 10-15 lbs might motivate me to start working out again, right? Maybe I'll finally feel like I've hit rock bottom, with nowhere to go but up... To my surprise, I've actually lost five pounds!!!   I know that may sound insignificant, it's really isn't that much weight at all. But it's more about the fact that I was really apprehensive about being in another depressing weight gain spiral, and instead I feel like for the first time I've found a way to balance my eating so that the pounds don't keep creeping back on. I'm really, really happy about finding balance, it makes me feel more in control and confident.
