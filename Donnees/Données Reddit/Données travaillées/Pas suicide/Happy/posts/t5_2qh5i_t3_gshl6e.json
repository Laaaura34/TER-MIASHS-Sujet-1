We all thought we'd be back in Italy by April 18th and our dogs would just come back to Italy with us... a lot has happened and now I'm moving to the US and I haven't seen my pets since. We haven't really known their condition because the shelter has rarely been giving updates but now finally tomorrow at 2 pm ill see my animals.
