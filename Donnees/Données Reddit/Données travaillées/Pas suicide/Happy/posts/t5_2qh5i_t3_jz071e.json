I started taking the correct steps to get my visa that would allow me to work, and saved up all the money I got to do so..\n\nSo many people helped me during the times I was jobless or saving up to create a life I wanted.. my best friend, my mum, I'm forever grateful. \n\nNow I'm able to work an above minimum wage job back in Canada, doing well this time! I'm so, so beyond happy that I'm able to spoil everyone I love (I never could before!!!) I never came from money, my mum did her best and I'm forever grateful for this, I know what it's like to struggle week to week and giving back is making me tear up, as I'm decorating gift boxes and cards I'm thankful to all of those who were in my life throughout all of my struggles and making them feel happy with a surprise is making me ecstatic.\n\nI've never been able to comfortably afford to buy ANYONE gifts before, I cant put into words just how happy it makes me to be able to give gifts I just cant get over it.. I cant believe I'm able to do this! \n\nI know this is random but I'm sooooo happy I could cry and I just had to let it put because I am bursting!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jz071e/im_so_happy_this_year_i_can_finally_give_gifts_to/", "title": "I'm so happy this year I can finally give gifts to those I love \u2661", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "misuinu", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606068307, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jz071e/im_so_happy_this_year_i_can_finally_give_gifts_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441141.7645452, "replies_charged": false}
