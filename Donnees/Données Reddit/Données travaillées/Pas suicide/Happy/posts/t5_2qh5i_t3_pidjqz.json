I went to the deep water area ridding waves but then shit the waves stopped.\n\nI didn\u2019t panic whatsoever but waved my hand to the life guard. If you know me, I am a guy who would panic even over mcd fries getting cold but there my brain acted like a real grown up telling my body to not act out and save oxygen. Never had such a clear thinking. \n\nWell, I didn\u2019t die as I tried keeping myself up instead of trying to reach shallow waters and in the meantime lifeguard dropped that swimmy thing which took me to shallow side.\n\nMan, never in my life I felt so good almost dying.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pidjqz/almost_drowned_at_a_water_park_but_overcome_the/", "title": "Almost drowned at a water park, but overcome the worst problem of my monkey brain.
