(over 170 sent so far! - I have a mission to send 1,000 by September next year!) \n\nIf you want to join my mission on spreading positivity, happiness, and love through small acts of kindness I do have a patreon you can get some lovely benefits along side paying to forward for someone else to receive some positivity in the post. \n\nwww.patreon.com/thegeekandthebeast\n\nYou can see my posts about it on Instagram along with my \"positive cards\" highlights of some of the lovely feedback I've received so far from the recepients.\n\nwww.instagram.com/TheGeekAndTheBeast\n\n\nLove, Ray X \n\nXx", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/q8wwic/cards_of_positivity_project_paying_it_forward/", "title": "Cards of positivity project - paying it forward with kindness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheGeekAndTheBeast", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634330126, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q8wwic/cards_of_positivity_project_paying_it_forward/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439271.4894497, "replies_charged": false}
