I love making websites and logos and all things design-y. I\u2019ve always thought dreamily about doing freelance work but I\u2019ve been worried I wouldn\u2019t be good enough yet. So far I\u2019ve only done free work for friends and family to build my portfolio.\n\nBUT the other day I put myself out there and posted to a local neighborhood message board and whaddaya know I got some bites!\n\nSomeone saw my website, design experience, and professional experience, and asked if I would be interested in working at their agency as a project manager\u2014we\u2019re meeting up to chat this week!\n\nAnother person saw my work and liked it enough to ask if I would help build their website and create a new logo for them!\n\nYOU GUYS I DID IT! I\u2019m still an absolute beginner to selling my work and putting my skills out there but I feel so proud that I\u2019ve worked hard enough to get my work noticed. I\u2019m so nervous and excited!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/bz5hpb/i_put_myself_out_there_and_got_an_unexpected/", "title": "I put myself out there and got an unexpected interview, and my first paid design client!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Mother_Of_Felines", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1560212226, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bz5hpb/i_put_myself_out_there_and_got_an_unexpected/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442873.9766145, "replies_charged": false}
