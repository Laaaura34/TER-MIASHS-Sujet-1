My last meal was at 13h and wasn't nothing to filling. I thought about eating something on the way home but everything was closed. \n\nI leave the bus near my house and I see this coffee shop open. I only have 80 cents and when I enter I tell that to the lady. She points me to the cakes with 80 cents price and tells me that she will make me the same price for another cake.\n\nI then tell the lady that the 80 cents cake is just fine cause I just want something to eat cause I was super hungry.\n\nThen this wonderful angle fallen from the sky tells me that I could choose anything I wanted cause no one leaves her shop hungry and I almost bawled there. Ended up eating the 80 cents cake tho. \n\nShe was super sweet and we need more people like her!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/n3h9fq/please_please_please_be_like_her_we_need_more/", "title": "Please please please be like her.
