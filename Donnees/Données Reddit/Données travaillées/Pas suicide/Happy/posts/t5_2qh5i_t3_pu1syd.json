Growing up, and even up until now, I was labeled and treated as a monster for acting the way I do by my blood relatives. Before I learned of my values, I was very toxic, but they are not without fault. They were the reason why I developed mental illnesses in the first place. \n\nI spent some years wallowing in my misery that I can never *belong*, and being a social butterfly didn't help me because that meant I didn't belong to any group, though I was made to feel and *was* welcomed. My 2020 was a horrible year - not just because COVID broke out. But this year, I've been actively looking for communities I can relate to and one community I finally feel belonged is the mental health community.\n\nIt also helps that the Chinese MMORPG I'm playing has many wonderful people I can call friends. We're all part of one Discord server. I've also made friends with quite a lot of them and I talk to these people on a regular basis - both in game and off game. I've also been able to have a few phone calls and group calls here and there. Despite hard and trying times in my life right now, not just because it's still COVID, I'm really enjoying this season. *I finally belong!*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pu1syd/it_just_feels_nice_to_finally_belong_mental/", "title": "It just feels nice to finally belong!
