I was ecstatic. We later found out she had a miscarriage, and it was devastating to me.\n\nMy aunt later got pregnant with a baby, and a little while later, to my surprise, my mother was pregnant too. This time she fortunately had the baby along with my aunt a few months earlier. My new baby cousin named Michael, and just months later my first brother named Ezekiel. 3 months later, my mother was pregnant again. This time, my second brother is born, named Elijah. It\u2019s been over 2 years now, I\u2019m 14, and all 3 of them still light up my life.\n\nThese little guys have no idea how much they mean to me, and I honestly think my life would be so uneventful and boring without them. They make me smile every day, and every time I look at one of them I feel so much love in my heart. I thank God for putting each of them in my life and all 3 of these babies are the best thing that have happened to me, and always will be. And thank you Ezekiel, Elijah, and Michael for brightening up my day, every day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/bw5qak/after_12_years_of_waiting_i_finally_have_brothers/", "title": "After 12 years of waiting, I finally have brothers, and I couldn\u2019t be happier", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Dismade_", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 17, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1559530315, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bw5qak/after_12_years_of_waiting_i_finally_have_brothers/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440870.5543714, "replies_charged": false}
