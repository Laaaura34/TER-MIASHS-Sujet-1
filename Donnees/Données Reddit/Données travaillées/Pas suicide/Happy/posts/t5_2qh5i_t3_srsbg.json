You're in for a rude awakening because once you're out in the big world, none of the gossip or the backtalk or the mean names are gonna matter. If you want something, don't be afraid of what everyone else has to say about your means of achieving it (except if you're a homicidal lunatic). Don't follow the crowd if your heart says no. Don't surround yourself with people you feel you need to impress. If you don't have someone you can connect with, don't worry because you have your whole life to find someone. Don't let anyone tell you you can't be the best version of yourself. Be the biggest weird-o you can be if you have to, because the only thing that matters is making yourself happy. So do yourself a favor and start doing it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/srsbg/my_little_brothers_advice_on_being_happy_he_is/", "title": "My little brothers advice on being happy.
