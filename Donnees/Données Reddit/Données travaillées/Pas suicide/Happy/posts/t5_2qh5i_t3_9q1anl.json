It took me a while to work up the courage to grab his hand. I brought my hand up to my chin and instead of putting it back in my lap, I put it on top of his hand. He held it almost immediately and we interlocked our fingers. Every now and then, he gave it a little squeeze. This continued for the last hour and a half of the movie. Each time he wrapped his fingers around my knuckles, I felt a smile emerge across my face and chills run up my spine. I will forever cherish those moments of pure bliss and affection. I have never felt closer to anyone in my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/9q1anl/today_i_held_a_guys_hand_for_the_first_time_i/", "title": "Today I held a guy's hand for the first time!
