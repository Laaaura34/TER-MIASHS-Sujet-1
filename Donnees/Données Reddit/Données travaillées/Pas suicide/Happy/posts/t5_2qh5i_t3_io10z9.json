A good 3 years of constant drudgery. From major depressive episodes to explosive emotional setbacks. These past two days have been phenomenal. I have no memories of being this at peace in any other time in my life. And it\u2019s not for any particular reason. I tend to attempt rationalizing things no matter how tedious it is, so naturally I assumed this was due to a recent surgery. I had my wisdom teeth removed, and I assumed I was \nA) I was coming off of the effects of anesthetics and my brain was just becoming more active over a period of a couple days. \nB) not feeling as much pain in my jaw or \nC) I was not eating as much, so I didn\u2019t feel as lethargic.\n\nI then broke the day down.\n\nI went fishing for the first time since the surgery and a friend came with me. She didn\u2019t fish, she just hung out and read a book while I fished. I had company. It was 78 F out. The water was very high, and there was a constant breeze. Not too much sun, ever so slightly interrupted by clouds. I caught four fish, 3 baby striped bass and a snook. Nothing big or spectacular. I hadn\u2019t lost any gear, my knife didn\u2019t get wet. I wasn\u2019t tired afterwards, I didn\u2019t get sunburned, I wasn\u2019t hungry, I wasn\u2019t dehydrated. We were in a semi isolated spot that couldn\u2019t be seen from the rest of the park. I drank a small mango smoothie. I listened to music and laughed. And I was happy. I was filled with a grand euphoria of which I have never known.\n\nI was in bliss.\n\nAnd I was the next day too. But what happened that \nnext day?\n\nNothing of note. At least to anyone without a habit of over-analyzing.\n\nI rode my bike and picked up a prescription from the pharmacy. I rode my bike through town to pick up some soap. I realized I left my card at home and went back to get it. I returned and bought my soap and came home. A suture from surgery fell out of my mouth. Nothing happened that was out of the ordinary. And yet this day I felt such peace and happiness.\n\nThese past two days have been the best I\u2019ve experienced in the past 6 years of my life. I have never    Felt such peace and bliss. And I don\u2019t know why. If it wasn\u2019t the little things, what was causing such joy within me?\n\nMaybe such a pure and meaningless joy is somewhat foreign to me in recent years. That\u2019s okay, I suppose. I\u2019m happy. And I haven\u2019t felt this good in so long.\n\nI never want it to end. It will, but that won\u2019t stop me from trying.\n\nThankfully this happiness bout has come about right after... something. I genuinely don\u2019t know how to describe what happened.\n\nRemember aforementioned friend? Maybe a couple of weeks before the last couple of days she said \u201cyou are tired, aren\u2019t you? You seem, like, hollow. Full of static.\u201d I asked what she meant and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just like a light in your eyes.\u201d I stood up and walked home. And I don\u2019t know what she meant.\n\nThis change of pace is a welcome one. It\u2019s so entirely minor and insignificant. But I\u2019m loving not dragging my unwilling soul behind me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/io10z9/a_nice_change_of_pace_brought_on_by_who_knows_what/", "title": "A nice change of pace brought on by who knows what.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nabbyy10", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1599453587, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/io10z9/a_nice_change_of_pace_brought_on_by_who_knows_what/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439195.2941608, "replies_charged": false}
