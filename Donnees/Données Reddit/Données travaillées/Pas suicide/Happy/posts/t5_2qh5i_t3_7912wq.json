I hated every second of it, and when I talked to them about switching majors to some kind of business degree, they tried everything to get me to stay. Luckily, my scholarships kept me from needing them financially, so I switched into a random business major and played a lot of catch-up in order to get my GPA somewhere good enough for top companies. After a lot of hard work and stress, I just accepted a dream job in my dream city in the finance department of a Fortune 50 company. I am literally over the moon, and as icing on the cake, my father (who was the most against me changing majors and a very stoic and non-emotional guy in general) just told me through tears that he was proud of me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/7912wq/about_to_graduate_college_debt_free_and_with_a/", "title": "About to graduate college, debt free and with a dream job!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tarn789", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 20, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1509079197, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7912wq/about_to_graduate_college_debt_free_and_with_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440881.5065932, "replies_charged": false}
