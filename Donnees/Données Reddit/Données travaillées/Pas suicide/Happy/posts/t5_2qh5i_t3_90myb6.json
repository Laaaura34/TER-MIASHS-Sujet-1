I started to get a bit bored, and I noticed there was only one other person in my age range, who happened to be a girl - I've always been a little sheepish around members of the opposite sex. \n\nI normally would never do this, but recently I resolved to be more confident. So I went over and said hi. What resulted was a really great conversation that took up about an hour until we got back into land. We talked about everything from school, to space, to a little bit of politics. Throughout she seemed to be really interested and engaged, so I'm not as bad as a conversationalist as I once thought. It was great. After we got back in, we followed each other on Instagram. \n\nI'm just really proud of myself because normally while I'm very lively around my friends, I just shut down when I don't know many people in the vicinity. Today I changed that. \n\nAnyway, yeah I guess it comes naturally to most people. Soon it will to me as well hopefully.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/90myb6/my_social_anxiety_is_finally_calming_down/", "title": "My social anxiety is finally calming down", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "time-gear", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 24, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1532149542, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/90myb6/my_social_anxiety_is_finally_calming_down/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439297.4945157, "replies_charged": false}
