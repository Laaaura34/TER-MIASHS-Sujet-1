People I actually just hang out with on my own, joke around with and have a good time. I don't think I could have asked for more!\n\nIt may seem silly, but I feel super privileged to have these friendships.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/6ovkwf/my_sister_is_engaged_and_i_was_the_first_to_know/", "title": "My sister is engaged and I was the first to know! :)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "stellarecho92", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 17, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1500737584, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/6ovkwf/my_sister_is_engaged_and_i_was_the_first_to_know/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442440.7019203, "replies_charged": false}
