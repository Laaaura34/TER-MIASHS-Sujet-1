Then about a week ago he moved to my town for college. We both confessed that we had feelings for each other but also seriously valued our friendship and wouldn't want to lose it for anything. Tonight we decided that if our friendship had made it through everything so far it was worth the risk. We held hands and kissed and it was a wonderful charming evening and I couldn't be happier right now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1l1hfw/decided_to_take_the_next_step_with_best_friend_of/", "title": "Decided to take the next step with best friend of almost two years.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cmw100", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1377404143, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1l1hfw/decided_to_take_the_next_step_with_best_friend_of/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439398.656892, "replies_charged": false}
