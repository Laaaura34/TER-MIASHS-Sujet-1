I can feel genuine happiness.\n\nI am the most productive I have ever been in my life: I spend around 8 - 10 hours reading, writing, listening to podcasts, education, research, etc. every day (with breaks in between, of course).\n\nIt has taken me a year, but I've learned self-love. I attempt to treat myself as someone I am responsible for helping - that's another way to put it.\n\nI have finally cracked the code to what's wrong with me and I am getting professional help. Finally knowing I have BPD, depression, emotional disturbances, and PTSD, I can rest and begin improving myself mentally. This took some misdiagnoses and a lot of suffering before it all clicked.\n\nThis couldn't be a better way of soon turning 18! I am really happy!
