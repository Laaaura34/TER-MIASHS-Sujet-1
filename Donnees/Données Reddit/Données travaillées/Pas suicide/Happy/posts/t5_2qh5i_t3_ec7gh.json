We had [turkey](http://imgur.com/fYzkn.jpg) with mashed potatoes, stuffing and cranberry sauce [from fresh berries].  Hubby helped whip the cream for the [chocolate cream pie](http://imgur.com/a0TGT.jpg) I made.  It was my second Thanksgiving making the meal myself.   It was also just my small family with no visitors and no running all over to see other  people.  We even kept the t.v. off.\n\nIt was the most peaceful Thanksgiving I can remember having.  \n\nI am so very thankful for having a wonderful hubby [also a redditor] and great kids to share my life with.  We don't have a lot by way of material possessions; but, I don't think that I could ever feel any richer than I do today.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ec7gh/blissfully_thankful/", "title": "Blissfully Thankful", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "soumokil", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1290806286, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ec7gh/blissfully_thankful/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439191.1975424, "replies_charged": false}
