Top that off with a serious workload over the next 3 months from my employers and I should be feeling maximum stress. But I don't. I'm finding it hard to give a shit about it when I know there's somebody out there who cares about me and is doing her best to support me, even from the other side of the world.\n\nJust the thought of her smiling or laughing at one of my shite jokes is enough to bring a beaming grin to my face. We met on holiday, and I was really uncertain for a time if she would want to carry on talking and making plans once we fell back into our routine. But she does want to make plans, and I've got a brief window in June where I can go and visit her. Its only for a week, and the flights are expensive but she's worth every penny. I haven't had someone make me feel this good in a long time. \n\nSo yea. She makes me happy, she makes my problems seem trivial and she doesn't know the half of how wonderful she is to me.
