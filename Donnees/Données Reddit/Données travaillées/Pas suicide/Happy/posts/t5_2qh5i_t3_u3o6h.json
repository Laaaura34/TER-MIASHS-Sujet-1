A little history... my parents signed an agreement back when I lived with them that did not permit anyone else in the household to have a license. (It made their insurance cheaper) Therefore, throughout college, grad school... and moving out, I never had a license. I live in an area where having a license means a better job. My fiance also lives about an hour from me, which makes things interesting. Note throughout all of this, my parents were not helpful whatsoever. Nor did they wish to help.\n\nI had to pay about $400 for driving instruction and lots of bribes to friends so that I could use their cars/get instruction. I failed 3 times- the first time the examiner kept yelling 'girl' at me, the second time the guy yanked the steering wheel from me, and the third time he lied and said I hadn't stopped at a stop sign (I did). \n\nFourth time was the charm. I did it even without my parents, and now there are a ton more jobs I can apply to. And one day, I'll have a car!!!!\n\nI'm so happy. SO so freaking happy.
