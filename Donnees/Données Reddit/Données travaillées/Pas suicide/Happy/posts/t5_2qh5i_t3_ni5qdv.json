I felt that many people were always looking down on me or just hated me the first sight they saw on me. When I finally told my friend all the things I\u2019ve been actually thinking about all this time, for all these years. She welcomed me with big open arms and I\u2019m just so happy right now. I thought I would be judged just like from the old experiences I had but I\u2019m just so speechless. It just makes me feel so much less alone then bearing all these thoughts in my mind. \ud83d\ude0a", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ni5qdv/i_always_had_a_hard_time_talking_about_my/", "title": "I always had a hard time talking about my personal issues and having \u201cgirl talk\u201d with my friends because I always thought I would be judged and unaccepted.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gumanesai", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621639627, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ni5qdv/i_always_had_a_hard_time_talking_about_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442967.799853, "replies_charged": false}
