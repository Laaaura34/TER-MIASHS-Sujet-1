Almost exactly 3 years ago I asked a girl out\u2026.I don\u2019t know why she said yes, but she did\u2026.she is the most beautiful person I\u2019ve met, everything she does puts a smile on my face\u2026 I am really not very emotional\u2026but she makes me feel happiness and some times I wouldn\u2019t say she makes me feel sad but rather an effect of something she does makes me feel sad\u2026But the truth is, I just want to hold her in my arms and slowly watch the sunset\u2026 I want to wake up in the morning and see her, when I\u2019m stressed out I just want to talk with her because her voice makes me smile. I never actually knew I was the long term relationship guy, but I want to spend my life with her and I honestly can\u2019t wait for our 3 year anniversary\u2026. I don\u2019t know if this is the right subreddit but yeah I\u2019m more than happy\u2026 I\u2019m in love :) \n\nI love you my sweet potato:)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pvays6/i_honestly_think_ive_met_the_woman_im_gonna_marry/", "title": "I honestly think I\u2019ve met the woman I\u2019m gonna marry", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "abhinavssridhar", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 26, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632589497, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pvays6/i_honestly_think_ive_met_the_woman_im_gonna_marry/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439070.3975902, "replies_charged": false}
