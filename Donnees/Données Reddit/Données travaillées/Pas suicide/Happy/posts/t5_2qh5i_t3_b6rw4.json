I had given up on myself and my abilities, and this is a real kick of euphoria after such a long bout of grief.\n\nThis might sound sappy, but I'd just like to add that you have always been there for me Reddit throughout the past year: educating me, keeping me socially aware, making me laugh. I'd just like to say thank you, and I hope you all have a wonderful day as well :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b6rw4/i_have_been_accepted_unconditionally_by_a/", "title": "I have been accepted unconditionally by a university after two years of grief and rejection.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mattbeetee", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 103, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1267182330, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/b6rw4/i_have_been_accepted_unconditionally_by_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440652.9538593, "replies_charged": false}
