I still live with my parents and that's normal here. I had a lot of free time during the mid-sem break so I decided to apply for a job. During the interview, I told them I am a college student and they were generous enough to provide me the flexibility to study and work at the same time. The salary is more than enough for me, considering I don't spend much apart from food and Spotify. I was really happy about it and I decided to keep it to myself for a while. \n\nI didn't tell anyone in my family about it. I was waiting to tell them about it after I get them a gift or something. So today my mom was complaining about her health. She has thyroid and pcos and lately, she has been complaining about headaches. I made an appointment for her and booked a routine checkup for her. I paid the bill and she asked me if I paid it from savings. I told her about my job and she was so happy.  She hugged me and was so happy. \n\nI finally told her and it felt so good. I feel so much better every time I think about it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/qcrtdl/i_paid_for_my_moms_health_care_for_the_first_time/", "title": "I paid for my mom's health care for the first time.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Low-Return-5496", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 29, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634822898, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/qcrtdl/i_paid_for_my_moms_health_care_for_the_first_time/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441121.5410593, "replies_charged": false}
