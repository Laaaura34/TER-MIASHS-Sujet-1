They are basically giant puppies, even when they\u2019re fully grown! They love being scratched and brushed and loved on. Sometimes I think they forget just how big they are, especially the Holsteins (the breed of the calf in the picture) but for the most part, a lot of them don\u2019t seem to have a mean bone in their body! They\u2019re such curious and delightful animals :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7qjub8/this_was_my_first_time_ever_getting_to_be_around/dsqm3o2/"}
