Chop and grind the meat while it's browning.\n\n2)Once the meat is brown, take it off the stove and dump it into the colander, shake out the excess grease, dump it back into the pan\n\n3)Add the sauce you're using to the meat. A little trick you can do to make sure it spreads evenly is to pour in all the sauce you can, then add a bit of water to the jar, shake it up, and pour the rest in.\n\n4)Add the onions and scallions to the meat. Stir.\n\n5)Turn the heat on low/medium and put the meat back on.\n\n6)The water should be boiling by now. Dump the pasta in.\n\n7)Boil the pasta for 12 minutes. Continue to stir both it and the meat, alternating between the two every minute. (If the you see the sauce start bubbling, turn the heat down a little).\n\n8)After 12 minutes, strain the noodles, toss em' in a bowl, dump the sauce on top, stir, maybe add a little Parmesan, and enjoy!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5nsthd/its_friday_which_means_its_time_to_go_get_my/dcfdqiy/"}
