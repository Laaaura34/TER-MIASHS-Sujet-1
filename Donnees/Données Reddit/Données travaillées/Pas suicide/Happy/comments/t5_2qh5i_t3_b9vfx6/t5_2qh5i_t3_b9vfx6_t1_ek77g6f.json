I am a psychology professor that specializes in cognitive behaviour. I firmly believe AND teach, that the best cure for depression is to serve, serve and serve some more. Granted some depression is clinical (lack of seratonin and dopamine since birth) but science has found it is actually very rare. Most people want a quick fix and are not willing to work for the seratinine and dopamine release (diet, exercise, sunshine, etc). Not to mention those that are on meds for it in which the limbic system finally says \"why should i make the happy chemicals if this drug is doing it for me.\" Not to mention the amount of media and instant news and blah blah blah and i could on for days when all i really wanted to say is \"excellent, valid post!\" Keep on preaching it, no matter the backlash.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/b9vfx6/how_am_i_happy_if_everyone_is_depressed/ek77g6f/"}
