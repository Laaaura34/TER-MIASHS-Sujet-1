Because of a problem with my spine I can't really feel my feet too much and I didn't think anything of it. Went to work, had a dinner date, watched Obama's state of the union. Getting ready for bed I noticed my toe was completely swollen and turning black.\n\nI've got insurance so I go to my Emergency Room (Kaiser). \n\n\"Yeah, I think I broke my toe.\"\n\n\"Sign here...\" Signed my name three times, got a wrist bracelet. They sent me to sit down and I had just enough time to TXT my girlfriend and let her know was going on. They called me back, did xrays, confirmed it was broken and put me in a foot brace. The longest time I waited was to leave.\n\n$75 co-pay. That was it. In and out in 45 minutes.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ax6ia/my_insurance_just_paid_for_everything_i_asked/c0jwd92/"}
