In my humble opinion, the person you are in a relationship with should be the one complimenting you and making you feel good about yourself. I hope your SO see's this interaction and gets a nudge to step up and make you feel as good as this new person did.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bc8j1l/always_dealt_with_selfimage_and_confidence_issues/ekop72l/"}
