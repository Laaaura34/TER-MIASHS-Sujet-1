I like the way you stopped the diamonds and did not wrap all the way around. That much more unique. Wonder what type of band you plan to put with it, matching?

Wishing you both much love and happiness on your future path. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/59d5gb/custom_designed_and_bought_an_engagement_ring/d98plxj/"}
