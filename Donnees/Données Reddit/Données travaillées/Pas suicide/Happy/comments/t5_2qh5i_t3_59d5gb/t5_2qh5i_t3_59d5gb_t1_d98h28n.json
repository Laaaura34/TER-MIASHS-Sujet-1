I can tell from the long and detailed post that you were very involved in the process. The ring is absolutely beautiful, and I am so happy for you and your (soon to be) wife! This post actually makes me tear up a little because on one hand it's great to see how much effort you put into it, and on the other hand...it kind of stirs up some kind of self pity. I hope I'll have an SO who cares as much as you do :) ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/59d5gb/custom_designed_and_bought_an_engagement_ring/d98h28n/"}
