I had my wife's ring made custom as well, actually quite similar to this. I found a local jeweler that did custom work in house, and was able to work directly with the artisan to create the ring design. Once I was happy he made up a bill of materials and time, and handed that to the salesman. It was excellent all the way through, he listened to my suggestions, gave me some of his own, pointed out things that don't work well, gave me very straight advice on the stones, overall I cannot recommend enough talking to someone who's job is creating, not selling.\n\nEdit: Potato quality pic of my wife's ring with the wedding band: [Picture](http://imgur.com/2BTAXpR)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/59d5gb/custom_designed_and_bought_an_engagement_ring/d98g5bg/"}
