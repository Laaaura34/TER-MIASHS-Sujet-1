I worked there in 2004 and it got me back on my feet and able to get out of a shit relationship, and again in 2014 when I moved to a foreign country to be with my (now) husband and didn\u2019t know the local language yet. \n\nIt\u2019s an honest day\u2019s work for an honest day\u2019s pay, and manager training from McD\u2019s on your CV is seriously golden almost anywhere in any industry. \n\nYou\u2019re in the way up and making your life better for yourself with each day. I hope you don\u2019t, but IF you fall off the wagon, remember there\u2019s nothing stopping you from climbing right back on. You got this.
