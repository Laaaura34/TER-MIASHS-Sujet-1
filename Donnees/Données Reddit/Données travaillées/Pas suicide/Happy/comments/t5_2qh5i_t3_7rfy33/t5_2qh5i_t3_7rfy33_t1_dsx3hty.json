I\u2019m 20 now. Been almost 2 years. I fucked around so much after graduation. Just smoking weed as much as possible and drinking if I wasn\u2019t doing that. I never held a job for longer than 2 months. I was so fucking depressed for so long.\n\nI\u2019ve recently gotten a lot better though, trying to get my life together. My dad told me about some scholarship stuff so I\u2019m signing up to take my SAT. Since around December I\u2019ve only smoked once cuz me and my bro found a roach lol, and I only drink a few beers a few nights a week. I really need some employment to finally start saving up some cash though.\n\nHow\u2019d you go about a job with such a shit employment history like mine? I\u2019ve had two jobs and quit them both without notice. My plan is to just lie and say I\u2019m getting my first job I guess, I just dislike being dishonest a lot. Part of changing myself I guess.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dsx3hty/"}
