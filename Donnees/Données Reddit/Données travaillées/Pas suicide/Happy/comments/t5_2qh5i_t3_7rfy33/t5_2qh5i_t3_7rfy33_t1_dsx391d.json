It\u2019s not easy to turn things around! I worked at McDonald\u2019s for years and that place did A  TON for me. Many people act like it\u2019s a terrible place to work but it gave me a great work ethic, helped pay for my first car and then college. I met some amazing people and am so proud of having worked there! \n\nHave fun at Hamburger University! Keep up the effort and positivity. Sending you light and love!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dsx391d/"}
