It was painful to watch how badly the withdrawals were hitting him, so I offhandedly suggested he pick up some kratom. He did, and the day he started was the day he stopped using suboxone completely. Now he\u2019s been clean of all opiates for 3 months. Kratom is amazing. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dsx5zvf/"}
