I\u2019ve seen so many amazing people lose your battle, and it\u2019s awesome that you\u2019re achieving your dreams. \n\nA good friend of mine owns several local McD\u2019s stores, her parents started one when they first became a franchise and then built more over the next 20 years or so. The process for her and her sister to take over the stores was intense. They had to work in the stores for I think 6-18 months? Attend several training sessions, do online courses, and more. I was pretty amazed, as my husband and I had looked into buying a Papa Johns and all you had to do was have the cash. \n\nAlso, another commenter mentioned the real estate aspect. As well as leasing the land the restaurant is on, they\u2019re required to update it very 5 years (I think) and do a complete tear down and rebuild every 20-25 years. They ended up closing their least profitable location because they had to rebuild 3 stores in one year and it costs a couple million each location.
