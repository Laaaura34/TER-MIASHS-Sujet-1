For me, it's the McChicken. The best fast food sandwich. I even ask for extra McChicken sauce packets and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige. \nOne time I asked for McChicken sauce packets and they gave me three. I said, \"Wow, three for free!\" and the nice friendly McDonald's worker laughed and said, \"I'm going to call you 3-for-free!\".\nNow the staff greets me with \"hey it's 3-for-free!\" and ALWAYS give me three packets. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local McDonald's restaurant, I go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream, 1-2 times for breakfast on the weekend, and maybe once for dinner when I'm in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable, fast, and can match my daily nutritional needs.\nI even dip my fries in McChicken sauce, it's delicious! What a great restaurant.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dswwum6/"}
