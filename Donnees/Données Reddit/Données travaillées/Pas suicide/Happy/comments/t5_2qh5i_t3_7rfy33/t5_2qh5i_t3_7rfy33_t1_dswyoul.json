When I was much younger I had job opportunity but they said I'd have to goto hamburger university. Having to tell people, where I lived, that I was driving two hours each way to go there just to be a caterer and put out flyers is kinda degrading. The name makes it sound like a fucking joke. Wouldn't be surprised if higher ups named as such to belittle the people coming through. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dswyoul/"}
