I just want to let you know that you\u2019re doing a great job and I\u2019m sorry that my first reaction was inappropriate. It isn\u2019t my job to pass judgment on others. I hope that you accomplish all the things you set out to do and that you continue to be strong and stay drug free! The only person who can stop you, is yourself. I wish you well!!
