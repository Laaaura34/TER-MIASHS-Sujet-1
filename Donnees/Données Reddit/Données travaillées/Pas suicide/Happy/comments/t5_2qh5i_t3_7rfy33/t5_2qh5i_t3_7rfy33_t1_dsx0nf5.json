I partied hard as a young un and then got a girl pregnant at 21. This was my sober up and fly right point. I worked hard (still enjoy the journey I promise) and will retire with about 2.5 mil in the bank while my party buddy(same age)from that era literally lives in his moms basement. \n\nWe live in a small town and I would see him around town through the decades and he would try to justify(in subtle ways) that I was missing the real version of life.  I was raising my son with my spouse and running my own business. I\u2019m wiping tears at school plays, buying his first bass and seeing him fly, and my crack head friend felt he had the better life. As I reached out to help, he would try to pull me in. \n\nHe hangs his weary head in embarrassment now and never doubts that he made the worst life choices. He also has three very successful siblings adding more contrast to his addiction lifestyle. He was smart, but not as strong as you are. \n\nStay strong - it\u2019s worth it.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dsx0nf5/"}
