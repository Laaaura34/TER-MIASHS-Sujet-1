My comment does not read that way, though. This bachelor party was for one of my friends. Your question still stands, though... Things get unsafe when you combine alcohol with a group of guys that already don't care a whole awful lot about the pandemic to begin with. The weekend was planned with a \"socially-distanced\" pretense, but it didn't go that way once everyone was drinking and ready to party.\n\nSeveral of the guys went to bars and strip clubs. I and one other person decided to stay at the Air BnB. He and I did what we could, but were still presented with a decent amount of risk because the other guys wanted to push the boundary of safe partying.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iowpya/didnt_think_id_be_able_to_have_a_bachelorette/g59p02e/"}
