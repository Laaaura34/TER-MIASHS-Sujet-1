A few bruises and torn muscles, but that's it. \n\nA pretty horrible experience in many ways, but MY WIFE ISN'T DEAD, when she so easily could have been. \n\nInstead of spending the day at the morgue, we spent it watching a stage production of The Gruffalo with my 3yo son. \n\nDoesn't get much better than that.
