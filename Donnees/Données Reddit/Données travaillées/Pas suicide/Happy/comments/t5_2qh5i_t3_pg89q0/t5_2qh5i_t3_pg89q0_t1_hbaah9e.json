When you\u2019re constantly held to such a high standard with grades, it\u2019s easy to tie your own self-worth to how you do in school, especially with Asian parents who don\u2019t offer a lot of positive reinforcement. But having parents who verbally acknowledge they love you and are proud of you regardless of how you did on an assignment really does wonders for you\n\nI didn\u2019t realize until I was out of the house, but having parents who never tied my value to my grades helped me grow without a lot of anxiety that a lot of my Asian peers did. I\u2019m really really happy for you, and I hope you grow up knowing you will always have your parents\u2019 support.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pg89q0/today_for_the_first_time_in_7_years_i_cried_tears/hbaah9e/"}
