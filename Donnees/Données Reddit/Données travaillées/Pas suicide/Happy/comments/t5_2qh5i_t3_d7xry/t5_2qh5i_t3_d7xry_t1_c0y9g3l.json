I congratulate you on doing the impossible ( as far as most people are concerned ). You should be proud of doing the right thing and not living beyond your means.              \n\nBut alas, I must add that you are destroying the economy. By eliminating your debt, you have erased money from the system. I know this sounds weird and might not make much sense. I thought the same thing when I saw [Money As Debt](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2550156453790090544#). But it truly is weird how today's money system works.               \n\nAs far as I'm concerned, let it crash. we need a new way of doing things. Again, you should be proud of being debt free, and I salute you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/d7xry/7_in_12_i_did_it_i_am_completely_credit_card_debt/c0y9g3l/"}
