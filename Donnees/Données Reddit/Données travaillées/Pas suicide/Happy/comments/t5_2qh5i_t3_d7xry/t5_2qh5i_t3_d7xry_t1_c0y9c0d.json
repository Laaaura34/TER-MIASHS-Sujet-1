The banking industry encourages people to get credit cards and then rack up huge amounts of debt. This allows them to collect on all kinds of fees. The consumer environment suggests to people that they can afford to have credit cards...and afford to charge a lot to them. People can drown in debt due to high interest rates and miscellaneous fees on top of what they owe. My dad actually started getting credit cards to pay off OTHER credit cards! (Granted, that is *very* stupid.)\n\nThat climate is changing now due to the economic situation, so people are finally starting to get smarter about the issue. A lot of us younger Americans came to maturity on the tail end of that massive boom of consumerism, so many of us ended up with credit cards. And a LOT of us have student loan debt from college. So... the financial climate is a bit of a struggle if you don't have good guidance as you mature into an adult. I personally found myself in a situation with student debt and $2,000 in credit card debt after college. I've taken care of most of that credit card debt, but am still working through the student loan debt.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/d7xry/7_in_12_i_did_it_i_am_completely_credit_card_debt/c0y9c0d/"}
