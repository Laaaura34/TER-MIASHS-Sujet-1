The 2 years I was in university was on full scholarship, and I worked a full time job. Every penny I earned went to travel accommodations, which were not luxurious in the slightest. Hostels, Norwegian Airlines, I even camped in the back of a stranger\u2019s bus in Germany to save my last money on food. The only reason I stopped traveling for now is because I\u2019m out of money. But I\u2019m happy, so so happy I saw the world and don\u2019t regret a single moment.
