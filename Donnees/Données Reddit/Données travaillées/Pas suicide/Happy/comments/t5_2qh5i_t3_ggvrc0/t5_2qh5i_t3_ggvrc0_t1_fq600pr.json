I got him last summer when he was only 2.5 months so he had lots of energy when i brought him to school; my roommate also had a cat, which made it easy to focus on school work-but depression/anxiety/adhd/ocd all got in the way. the second i withdrew from spring semester and went home, my full focus was on getting better, and he would constantly bring his toys to my bed, so even if i wouldn\u2019t have the energy to leave my bed at that moment i could still play with him. slowly i started getting more energy, and would get excited to focus it towards things related to him-such as buying him a leash and taking him outside. i did adopt him with the intent of him being an esa-i still have yet to fill out any of the paperwork needed- but he has helped me in more ways than i could ever imagine!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ggvrc0/i_dropped_out_of_college_due_to_mental_illness_im/fq600pr/"}
