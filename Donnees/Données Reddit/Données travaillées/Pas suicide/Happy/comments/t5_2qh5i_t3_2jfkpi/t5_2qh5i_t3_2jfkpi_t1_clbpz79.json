It's just \"don't do something helpful, just wait for a perfect world\". Sorry, but how exactly do you expect that there will never be poor people?\n\nCriticizing someone for giving poor people help they need, in a way that's feasible for them to provide as an individual, with something as stupid as \"someone needs to make them stop being poor, THAT'S what needs to happen\" is just wrong. Yes, everyone realizes that a perfect world would be great. No, that does not mean literally giving food to people that can't afford food is a useless and ignorant move.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2jfkpi/this_refrigerator_was_installed_on_the_street_by/clbpz79/"}
