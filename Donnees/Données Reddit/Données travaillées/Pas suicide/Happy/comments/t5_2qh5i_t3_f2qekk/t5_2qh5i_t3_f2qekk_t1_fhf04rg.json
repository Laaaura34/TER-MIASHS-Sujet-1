I'm glad you took the time to make yourself something fresh. Most people think it' all about weight loss, but eating right really will just make you feel better. I was just talking to my wife last night about how fortunate I am that she finds using frozen food as the bulk of your meals to be unfathomable. There are tons of easy options, too (even frozen veggies have microwavable steam bags that are delicious and healthy for you). Keep it up. Start watching cooking shows. You'll get really inspired to cook more and you'll start to notice your sleep patterns improve and heightened levels of energy!
