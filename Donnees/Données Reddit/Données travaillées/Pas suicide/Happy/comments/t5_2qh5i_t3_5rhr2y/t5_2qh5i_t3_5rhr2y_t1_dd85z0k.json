I'm always hoping one of these days I'll come across a group of washed up ex-band geeks who want to kickstart the ska movement again. I took my fianc\u00e9e to an Aquabats show a couple years ago and while they lost the horns long ago, it was so nice to be back in that scene for just a night.\n\nThe Last Shadow Puppets are okay, I actually tend to enjoy Alex Turner's side projects far more than his Arctic Monkeys stuff, but none of it's really my style. As far as that scene goes, The Vaccines, Elbow, The Maccabees, Everything Everything, and Hot Hot Heat are all really decent starting places if they're looking to stick with that sound. They're all male vocalists, but at least you can familiarize yourself with some non-Alex Turner British Alternative. \n\nI actually have a recommendation I think you'll love. I have a close friend who has gotten very popular in her solo career lately, but her band back here at home is incredible and when she comes in town they absolutely kill every show. Here's their Bandcamp: \n\nhttps://thestarkillerstn.bandcamp.com/album/american-blues\n\nThey changed their name last year to Forrister but since her solo career blew up they haven't had time to record under that name, so sadly I don't have access to their newer material. Let me know what you think, I probably have a ton more recommendations if you're interested.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5rhr2y/i_joined_a_band/dd85z0k/"}
