We've been together 3.5 years, and celebrating our first wedding anniversary July 5. So my advice is, LDR fucking sucks, but if you want it to work it will. Good luck and I'm really truly hoping you guys the best!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/38z0fs/i_finally_found_her_i_never_thought_it_would/crzpb7p/"}
