Also, check out your school resources. I see a therapist on campus for only $10 a semester. There's a Counselor Training Center - grad students who are super close to graduating and need more practice. Or there's also professional counselors at the Counseling and Consultation office. Just search around on your school's website and maybe they have something similar to one of those. Good Luck!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/eylue/i_just_received_a_total_4775_grant_money_for/c1bzg4d/"}
