At least, I think I am. I've been through some trauma in my life and have some issues related to that. Which makes sense. Most people who've been through trauma have stuff to go through because of it.\n\nBut on a daily basis, and for the most part, I'm a genuinely cheerful, energetic, optimistic, positive person. That's who I am to the core of my being, and no amount of trauma or challenges I've faced or will face will ever change that.\n\nI look at the world through eyes of innocence and whimsical-ness and that's just who I am, despite everything.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2ndmmv/i_think_im_clinically_euphoric_anyone_else/cmeavz4/"}
