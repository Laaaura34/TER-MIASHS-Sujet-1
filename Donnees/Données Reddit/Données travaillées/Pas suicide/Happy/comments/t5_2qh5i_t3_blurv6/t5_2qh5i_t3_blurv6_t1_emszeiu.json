You will not see a lower activity level. You will most likely be more energetic and feel better than you ever have.\n\n2. Your IF schedule is a lot easier than it may seem. 16:8 is a really easy one (16 hour fast, 8 hour eating period). You could be eating from 8am-4pm or 10am-6pm and see amazing results. The one big thing is to just not eat after 7pm.  Another popular option is 18:6, 20:4, or OMAD (One Meal a Day, which is what I do!). You could even do ADF (Eat  24 hrs, fast 24 hrs). Your goal is very realistic on an IF diet, and will be easier the larger you fasting time is. \n\n3. For the foods, this is up to you. Eat what you like. Do you love pasta? Eat some fucking pasta. But the best thing that you can do is to not eat fast food or eat out. This simple change will allow you to not only eat much me food, but still be losing weight. \n\n4. Want to lose that 40 pounds in one month? Do an extended water fast. The first three days will be terrible, but the rest you will feel better than you have in your entire life. Not only that, but it will most likely reverse diabetes, if you have it. \n\n5. Educate yourself. \u201cFasting\u201d as an amazing and accurate resource about fasting, including the possible negatives. r/fasting has an amazing wiki for learning how to start fasting.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/blurv6/for_my_birthday_i_worked_hard_and_gave_myself_the/emszeiu/"}
