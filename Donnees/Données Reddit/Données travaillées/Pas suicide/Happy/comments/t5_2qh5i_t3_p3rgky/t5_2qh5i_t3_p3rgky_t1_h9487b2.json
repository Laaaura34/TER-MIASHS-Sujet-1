I was the same and can say still the same as I haven't found my dream job yet lol however instead of going for a job I started my own business so now what my dream was is with me in a form of a business. I studied investment banking but always wanted to have a career in an IT lol got a job in a bank but business on the side. Not long that I'll give up on my job and run my business full time. The reason I said dont forget yourself was because I've been doing that trying to juggle both things together you know so enjoy everything you can without compromising your mental health! \ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p3rgky/i_received_an_offer_letter_for_my_dream_job/h9487b2/"}
