I'm more of the open book type: I'll tell my girlfriend exactly how I feel as it happens, whether I'm in OP's mood or in a \"leave me alone for a bit\" one. Having to hide how I really feel killed off a couple of my previous relationships, so I'm not keen on repeating that experience - and hey, we've been together for nearly five years now, engaged for three and going strong.\n\nI'm not saying that there are no girls who match your description (and I guess your experience as well). I'm just saying that I've gone out with girls who didn't match it, so I don't agree that \"It's a turn-off for [all] girls\".", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/14nsyl/me_and_my_girlfriend/c7ewn0l/"}
