They do these tests for a reason. It's tough to be taking care of a kid with downs, especially if you're more than 50-60.\n\nOP, they'll make you go through with a lot of tests but please remember that there's a good reason for it. That said, Congratulations! A pregnancy should always be celebrated (stay away from the alcohol though!).\n\nEdit: [Source!](http://downsyndrome.about.com/od/diagnosingdownsyndrome/a/Matagechart.htm)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/xy5oa/pregnant_at_40/c5qysdk/"}
