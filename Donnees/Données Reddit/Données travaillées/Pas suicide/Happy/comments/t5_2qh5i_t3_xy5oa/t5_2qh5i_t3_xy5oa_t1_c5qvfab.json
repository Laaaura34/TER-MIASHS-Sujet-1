That was almost eleven years ago; now my mom's fifty, and she and my little sister are living in Florida, and every time I go to visit she is always so happy! She's healthy, teaching elementary students, has a new man in her life, and probably the most content person I know. I wish the same for you and your (future!) family!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/xy5oa/pregnant_at_40/c5qvfab/"}
