When he told me he literally just said, \u201cI\u2019m gay\u201d and I said \u201cyeah, I know\u201d and we just laughed and joked around that I\u2019ve kind of known that for years.  Then he called my dad and told him. My dad cried and said that he still loves him the same, but they still haven\u2019t actually talked about it since then.  And all of my other family was basically like \u201ccool, so what\u2019s up?\u201d Haha.\n\n\nEdit because I keep getting messages. My brother is not single. Part of his coming out was letting us know that he is engaged to his partner of 4 years. \n\nAlso, please leave the negativity to yourself.
