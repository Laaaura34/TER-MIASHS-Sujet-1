I will be 10 weeks out on Tuesday and am feeling amazing. I have so much energy, my levels are good, my sister in law/donor is doing great, and my whole skin tone is back. I\u2019m getting ready to go back to work, and best of all, I\u2019m feeling healthy enough to be a really good mom again for my 16 month old daughter. Life is good here, and I am hoping that Mort the kidney will get me 17 or 24 years!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9zz1my/i_decided_to_fulfill_my_childhood_dream_of/eaeewdd/"}
