I noticed that in addition to cluster/PH there doctors also deal with cervicocranial pain. I've asked both my neuro and ortho docs if the severe disc disease in my neck could be causing all or part of my headaches and they both looked at me like I was crazy and said no. So I want to see the doctors in NY, they look like they may know more about rare types of headaches anyway.  Also, Mt Sinai and another place in North Jersey do ketamine treatment and I'd like to see if it will help. I'll have to pay out of pocket, but at this point I don't care. I'm in pain of varying degrees every day for years and it's mentally, physically  and emotionally fatiguing.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gss1n6/my_daughter_suffered_with_one_of_the_worst_pain/fsrkwno/"}
