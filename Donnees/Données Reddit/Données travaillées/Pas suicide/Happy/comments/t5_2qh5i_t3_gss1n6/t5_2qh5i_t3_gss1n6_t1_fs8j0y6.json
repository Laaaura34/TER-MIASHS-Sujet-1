As a person who NEVER has headaches, I sympathize. I had it in my left eye and cried my self to sleep for days as it felt like someone was lighting the nerves on fire in my brain. \n\nI hope that recovery and healing have nowhere to go but up for you and your family. I am so hopeful that this will bring lasting peace and a chronic pain free future.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gss1n6/my_daughter_suffered_with_one_of_the_worst_pain/fs8j0y6/"}
