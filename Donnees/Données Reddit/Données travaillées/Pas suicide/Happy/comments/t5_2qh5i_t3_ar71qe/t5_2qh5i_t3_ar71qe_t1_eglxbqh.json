And before you reflexively downvote, consider that researchers are currently in the process of (it seems) finding that vitamin D causes almost none of the beneficial effects that caused everyone to supplement with vitamin D over the past twenty years. Instead, it appears direct exposure to sunlight (which also happens to produce vitamin D) may be the cause of all/most of the good results associated with vitamin D.\n2. \"highest exposure groups\" \n3. A man's lifetime chance of getting Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is about 1 in 42. This study is saying that changed to about 1 in 30 for people with the highest exposure. Their confidence interval is pretty wide though: anything from 1 in 37 to 1 in 24\n4. For comparison, a male non-smoker has a roughly 1 in 500 chance of getting lung cancer. A former smoker has a 1 in 18 chance. Meaning that just being a former smoker, and among all smokers, not just the heaviest smokers, increases a man's chance of getting lung cancer by *2650%*.\n5. Did the smoking numbers, then realized coal miners would be a better comparison. A quick google says they increase their risk of lung cancer by 55%.\n\nI'm not saying people should drink glyphosate, but it's important to consider that this is one type of cancer, and not that much of an increase. It's worth considering how to minimize exposure and mitigate the risks.\n\nBring on the downvotes :-)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ar71qe/im_in_remission_and_i_have_a_hairline_again_well/eglxbqh/"}
