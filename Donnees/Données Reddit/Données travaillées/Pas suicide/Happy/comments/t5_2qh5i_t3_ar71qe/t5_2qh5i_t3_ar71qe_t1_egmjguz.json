The study talks about people with the highest exposure to glyphosate, that almost has to be farm workers, and there are many other other factors that group has in common, meaning that it might be glyphosate, or might be something else those people are routinely exposed to.\n\nAnd smoking is just an example of how much worse exposure to something harmful can be. Again, I'm not saying glyphosate doesn't merit attention, just that it's not a health crisis anywhere close to the proportions of many other issues we face. For example, if you had money to spend on a health issue and you could choose between reducing the number of teen smokers or reducing glyphosate exposure, you should absolutely work to reduce teen smoking. It's not even close.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ar71qe/im_in_remission_and_i_have_a_hairline_again_well/egmjguz/"}
