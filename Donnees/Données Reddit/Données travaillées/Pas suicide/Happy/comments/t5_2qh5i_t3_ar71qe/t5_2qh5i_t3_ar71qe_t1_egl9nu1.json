I\u2019m lucky that I have a wonderfully caring support network, but even still it was terrifying. The worst bit was/is the guilt over what I was/am putting my loved ones through!\n\nIt helped clarify a couple of things though. Firstly that I don\u2019t need children to be happy (50% chance of being infertile after this treatment, which caused me no bother) and that secondly, I wish I had travelled more.\n\nI haven\u2019t yet been able to tick anything off a bucket list as the treatment was so rough that I basically couldn\u2019t function very well, and now I\u2019m in \u2018recovery\u2019 and my mobility is affected - the cancer turned out to be in my hips, pelvis and spine. So I need to regrow my bones and then start saving to travel and see the world :) ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ar71qe/im_in_remission_and_i_have_a_hairline_again_well/egl9nu1/"}
