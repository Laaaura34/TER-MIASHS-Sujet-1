They run for around $150, and are so much fun. Mine has all the original Atari, NES, SNES, Sega Genesis and Sega MegaDrive games on it. And that\u2019s not even all of them, there are more consoles too like the Commodore 64. If that\u2019s not enough for you, there\u2019s an emulator called CoinOps 8 that has a ton of arcade games, Xbox games, N64 games, and PS games. Not to mention you could get original Xbox games for it as well. They\u2019re worth more than $150 in my opinion and are much better than the retro mini consoles they\u2019ve been coming out with lately.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7r1myp/i_know_this_sounds_tacky_but_i_finally_found_one/dstsoiz/"}
