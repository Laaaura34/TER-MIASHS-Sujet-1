I\u2019ve posted a few bits and pieces in these comments but my project was a short film which you can watch [HERE](https://youtu.be/51eXS8kARto) if you want to.\n\nIt\u2019s a mild horror that turns into something a bit more dramatic about a girl who is haunted by reflections showing her future.\n\nIt was shot in 4 days but the writing, editing and other work towards it made work on the project last from February until June, but this is partly because I went a bit over the top doing research because I really wanted it to be alright. Let me know if you watch it and what you think, thanks for the comment!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ok2n30/the_first_time_ive_ever_won_anything_before_and_i/h57yy1o/"}
