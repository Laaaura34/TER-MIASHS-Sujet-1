Live wild and free. Anyone who has given you a hard time is living in a closed system, a heart without empathy. You get to live you and be you, with an open heart. Thanks for doing that, I imagine it has taken a lot of courage along the way. And that is what the world needs more of\u2014you being you.\n\n\n\nAnd thanks for making me crave pizza as I\u2019m eating this boring peanut butter toast :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mlth9z/im_having_a_life_changing_surgery_on_the_8th_as_a/gtp03lr/"}
