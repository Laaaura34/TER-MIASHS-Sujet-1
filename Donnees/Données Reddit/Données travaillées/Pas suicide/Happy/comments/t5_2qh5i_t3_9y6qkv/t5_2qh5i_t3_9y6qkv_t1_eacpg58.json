I enjoyed listening to his completed stuff. When he showed me it I would often tell him how great it was and how he was so talented. He was gifted creatively, no doubt. I would ask how his music stuff was coming along as well (even though I had 0 idea what anything meant). \n\nI feel bad, but I couldn't just sit there and hear him play while he was making music, especially when he had headphones in. Tinkering with different sounds and hitting the same keys over and over again stressed me out. To me, someone who is 3% gifted in music and tone deaf, it feels a lot like someone clicking a pen over and over again. I could not be OP. \n\nI rarely asked him to play for me. Thanks for you comment, it made me realize I could've shown more interest in his music as it was his passion. I never realized how much joy it could have brought him. \n\n&#x200B;", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9y6qkv/im_listening_to_my_boyfriend_playing_piano_in_the/eacpg58/"}
