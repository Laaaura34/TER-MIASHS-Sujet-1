Also 13 y.o bro and 16 y.or sister. My mom always commented how she thought my youngest sister would be left out or not cared as much by me. In fact, she's always surprised how much my youngest sis and I are extremely close. I was excited when mom had her and ever since she was born, I never let anything hurt her and I care so much for her (even more than my other siblings, sadly? haha)\n\nIf anything, it'd be a nice thing because imagine it as the eldest brother is paving the road for her; it'll be an easy life for her. :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2sapgk/i_gave_birth_to_my_perfect_baby_girl_this_morning/cnolv1y/"}
