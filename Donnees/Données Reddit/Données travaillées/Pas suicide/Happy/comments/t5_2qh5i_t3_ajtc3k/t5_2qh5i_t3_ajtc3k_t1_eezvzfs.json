I've tried a lot of things, with even medical support for a while but I just can't gain weight. The thing is that somewhere between this and now, I've got some confidence that made much easier to be ok with my weight, my arms, my legs, the way I am. When I realized it, that I was *okay with myself* it was such a relief, it showed me that the problem wasn't in my body but in my head, a misconception. There is no such thing as normal body and no one should aim to it. I am a bit below my ideal weight but as for everything else, I'm healthy, and happy with the way I look. Just want you to know that this Joy is shareable, not just by reading you post but because some people felt the same, and hopefully feel like you do now!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ajtc3k/overcame_anorexia_finally_comfortable_in_my_own/eezvzfs/"}
