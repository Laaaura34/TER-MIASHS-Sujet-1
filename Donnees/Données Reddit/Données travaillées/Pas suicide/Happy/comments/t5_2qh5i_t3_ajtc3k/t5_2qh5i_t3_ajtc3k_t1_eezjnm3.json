It was a tough time, that of me throwing up at least 5 hours in a day and counting every single calorie and beating myself up for wanting to eat \n\nAs for what changed me, I'd love to say I just woke up one morning and saw that I was being absurd, and that none of it really matters but not really... It took an year or therapy, which I was initially reluctant to attend but did anyway\n\nAnd thank you <3", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ajtc3k/overcame_anorexia_finally_comfortable_in_my_own/eezjnm3/"}
