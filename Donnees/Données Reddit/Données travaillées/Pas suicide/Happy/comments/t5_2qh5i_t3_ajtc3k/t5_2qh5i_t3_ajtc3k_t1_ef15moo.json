Not an offensive question at all! I love talking anout this shit.  Basically no, you dont feel that satisfying big poop feeling at all. :( In fact, you usually dont feel really anything. The ostomy is made out of intestine tissue, and the nerves in those tissues dont have feel receptors (i dont know the right science words). When you touch it it cant feel anything. Sometimes when the stoma moves (it does that! You can watch it moving independently,  its so weird) you can feel the skin around it, but the stoma itself doesnt have any feeling. After my surgery one of the thoughts that bothered me SO much was wrapping my head around the fact that id never have that satisfying poop again, or the satisfaction of letting a real \"ol big one rip. While I joke about this a lot, I genuinely get a little sad sometimes when I thought about not being able to fart ever again. Its been a few years so I've basically accepted it by now, but i still do miss it time from time. I have so much material for jokes though, and I do love exploiting the whole thing for some good laughs, so theres that. But anyway, thats why I so appriciate that you asked. Because I honestly struggled with the loss internally for a while, but its not exactly the kind of thing you could bring up or talk to most people about without it just being really weird. While I had almost died I kinda thought most people would look at me funny for being sad about the not pooping thing", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ajtc3k/overcame_anorexia_finally_comfortable_in_my_own/ef15moo/"}
