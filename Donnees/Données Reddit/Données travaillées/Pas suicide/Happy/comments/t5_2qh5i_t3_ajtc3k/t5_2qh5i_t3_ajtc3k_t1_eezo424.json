I know the journey wasn't easy but you did it and should be proud! My breaking point made me realize that I was measuring my happiness in pounds. So instead of checking the scale every day (several times a day) I encourage you to check your happiness levels every single day. And to supplement your life with laughs and new experiences and people you love. If  you feel like you're at a 5 or worse, sing your favorite songs in a bubble bath or paint your heart out. I hope your days are filled with smiles and joy, you got this!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ajtc3k/overcame_anorexia_finally_comfortable_in_my_own/eezo424/"}
