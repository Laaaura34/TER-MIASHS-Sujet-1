I finally quit three years, ten months, and twelve days ago, and is honestly the best decision I've made in my life. \n\nTell her to get a stop smoking app to count her days smoke free; knowing I'd have to reset the counter on mine kept me from giving in more than once, and they usually give you feedback on the healthy changes happening in your body and badges when you reach daily, weekly, and monthly goals. \n\nNicotine gum really helped me, too. Just follow the schedule they give you in the packet and that'll help ease the worst of the withdrawal.\n\nAlso, she's going to start coughing in a week or so and it's going to sound really, really bad, like maybe she has tuberculosis. That's because her lungs are finally able to repair themselves after so long. The coughing goes away of course, but it lasts awhile.\n\nAnd even if she gives in and has a cigarette, that doesn't mean she can't quit, it's just a bump on the road. I'm happy for both of you that she's taken this amazing step.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8srlrd/the_love_of_my_life_quit_smoking_last_night_help/e1248yu/"}
