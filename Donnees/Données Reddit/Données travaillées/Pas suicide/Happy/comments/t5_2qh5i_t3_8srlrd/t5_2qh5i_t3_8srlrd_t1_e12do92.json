I quit smoking cigarettes, weed, and alcohol all in one day. Now my son is here, and I could have a drink again, in a couple of years I can probably enjoy getting high now and then. \n\nToo bad those two were easy. I never even think about them. I smoke cigarettes in my dreams almost every night, though.\n\nThe only thing that keep me away is thinking of my child. Of the effects of second/third hand smoking on him, of him not having a mom or having to watch his mom battle some horrible cancer, the social stigma of smelling like smoke, having a parent who can\u2019t play with him... and more than anything, I think about the fact that at a pack a day, and $11.75 a pack, I\u2019d be taking $350 a month away from my child to invest into a premature grave.\n\nNasty habit. My mom smoked while pregnant with me, smoked around us as kids, smoked inside all without abandon. My first cigarettes all were stolen out of her packs. My first pack was bought for me by her. The cycle ends with me. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8srlrd/the_love_of_my_life_quit_smoking_last_night_help/e12do92/"}
