Put the money in a jar and treat yourself to a holiday or upgrading your house or whatever it is you've always wanted. Having a nicer kitchen or a new car is much better than smoking in the long run. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8srlrd/the_love_of_my_life_quit_smoking_last_night_help/e12g538/"}
