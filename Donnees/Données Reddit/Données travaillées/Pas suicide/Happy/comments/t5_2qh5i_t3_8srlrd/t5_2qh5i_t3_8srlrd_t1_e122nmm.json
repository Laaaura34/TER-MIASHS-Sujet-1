Im used to chain smoking cigarettes in the morning, smoking one every hour at work and chain smoking again after work on my hour ride home. Ive overcome the temptation of this \"schedule\" all day.

And so thankful for the support of my husband to be, and the nice folks on reddit. \nIdk why u even commented on this to be a negative nancy.
