Day one is not quitting though. Ive gone 6 months without a cigarette and i still think about it. I have caved before after going so long. Best tip i can give is to get into better habbits. I started working out and eating healthier to replace the habbit of smoking. When i feel a craving i just work out for a half hour and i feel better. Good luck but maybe dont announce it for a while.
