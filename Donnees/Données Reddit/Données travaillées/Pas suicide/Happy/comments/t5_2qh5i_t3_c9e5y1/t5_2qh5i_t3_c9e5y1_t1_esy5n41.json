Focus on yourself for the near future. Someone else will come along when you are not looking for it.  And it'll be a stronger, deeper (aka. better) relationship. \n\nBTW I have the same type of thing with a few shirts too.  Mainly resort shirts you might wear in Vegas or Hawaii.  There are a few that make you feel really good.\n\nOh yeah.  Boy do I know that feeling.  In my case, beaten down by life.  Has to do with my last job and not a relationship.  \n\nWoman I worked with as a peer for 10 yrs became a dept head in another company and recruited me to head half her dept doing what I excel at and she sucked at.  Won't bore you with details. Anyone wants to know, DM me. \n\nMade my life hell for 4 years until I quit.  Made a lot of money and experience.  Got a top of the line title from it for my next job.  But it cost me my confidence in my own abilities (which I never experienced before).  \n\nTook 3 years of therapy and a highly experienced (a LOT more than her) outsider in the same field looking objectively at my abilities and concluding, \"Dude!  When I was running depts and projects, I would give my left arm to have you reporting to me and running things on my team!  And I know alot of people that would too!\" before getting back to normal (for me anyway). \n\nAll the best!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/c9e5y1/been_struggling_with_getting_over_an_old_ex_from/esy5n41/"}
