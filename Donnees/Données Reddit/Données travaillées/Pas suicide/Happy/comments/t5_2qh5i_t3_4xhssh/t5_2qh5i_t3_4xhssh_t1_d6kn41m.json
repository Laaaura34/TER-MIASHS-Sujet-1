The album isn't very explicit in its meaning, but my interpretation of it fits in really well with your story.  Might be worth a listen if that's something that appeals to you.\n\n\nHere are the lyrics to [Fellow feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ardc3nrQMxw)\n>\"I cried, for I didn't think it could be true\n\n>That you and I might have always known one another\n\n>And that we could not only evoke, but conjure a place of our own\n\n>And everywhere, that has ever existed\n\n>Is all on the surface of our dream\"\n\nand the lyrics to [Years of war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34thwBLMe4g):\n\n>\"Take one last look at what you're leaving behind,\n\n>'Cause there's no coming back once we go\n\n>We are the children of an innocent crime,\n\n>And its time to take down the throne\n\n>Although their heads may shake,\n\n>We'll set the city ablaze for their treachery\n\n>We'll spill their blood and set our fathers free\n\n>Ooh, two hundred years of war\n\n>Fight till we are no more\n\n>A curse on the streets of gold, ooh ooh\n\n>Just know\n\n>That mine is a hand to hold\n\n>Take back what the kingdom stole", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4xhssh/my_dream_girl_although_this_is_a_repost_i_think/d6kn41m/"}
