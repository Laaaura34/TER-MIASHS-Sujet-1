Just make sure you\u2019re genuinely happy and not manic please! \n\nHappiness is healthy and safe and beneficial. Mania is just as bad as depression and potentially as harmful.\n\nAs someone with bipolar who can fluctuate between the two, I can tell you, neither one is fun.\n\nI hope you\u2019re happy! I genuinely do. I just feel responsibility to make sure it\u2019s not false.\n\nBest wishes! ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9p0gwf/nobody_irl_seems_to_understand_so_im_going_to/e7yipbk/"}
