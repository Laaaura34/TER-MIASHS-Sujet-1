I think I would be so mad at myself! \n\nCongrats on taking the first step. The first 2-3 days are the hardest were the hardest for me. I was having bad cravings and I was in a bad mood. The rest of the week was pretty bad too but I got a bunch of gum and sunflower seeds to help keep my mouth busy and keep my mind off of it. Getting those things helped me get through the first two weeks. I also didn't drink on the weekends because I knew I would crave nicotine like crazy. \n\nAfter the first week though it was a lot easier. At that point the nicotine cravings weren't that bad. I just missed the habit of vaping. I ALWAYS had my vape on me pretty much always holding it and that habit was tough to break. There were several times when I was driving or at my computer, the two activities I when I would vape the most, and I would out of habit reach for it. Just made me crave nicotine! \n\nBut if you can get through this first week it is so easy to tell yourself you can do another week, and then a month! The app is also really helpful and good motivation. Even just seeing those hours go up on the first day was motivating for me. \n\nPS - if you want any other tips or things I've been doing please PM me. Happy to help!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gf1pau/it_wasnt_easy_but_i_am_so_proud_of_how_far_i_have/fpw336q/"}
