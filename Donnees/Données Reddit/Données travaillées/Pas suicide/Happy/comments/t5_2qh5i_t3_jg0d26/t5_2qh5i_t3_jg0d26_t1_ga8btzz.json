To a busy instructor they are a god-send.\n\nVet tech, now forgive me I have to assume that is working with animals yes? then you have my utmost admiration. If you wish and only 'if' I am here to help with reports you construct. I stress  only if.\n\nBest wishes, (suggested reading \"All creatures great and small\" the story of a UK vet)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jg0d26/i_turned_in_my_first_written_assignment_for_my/ga8btzz/"}
