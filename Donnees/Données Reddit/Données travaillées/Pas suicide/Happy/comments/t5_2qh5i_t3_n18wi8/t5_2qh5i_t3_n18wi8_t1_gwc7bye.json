I\u2019ve only had my piercings for about 1-1.5 years (depending on the piercing) and my chronic back issues have been prominent for about 4 years now, so I don\u2019t necessarily think they\u2019re changing anything. If anything I think the back issues are related to a car accident I had in 2016. Thank you for the info though, not a bad idea to keep in mind! \n\nAll the best of luck to you my far away friend! \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n18wi8/i_live_with_chronic_back_pain_its_been_tough_the/gwc7bye/"}
