This is wonderful news and I'm so excited for you! Sticking through school must have been rough, but I'm proud of you for doing it anyway. Where you are now is nothing short of hard work and determination. I'm glad that you remembered your friends names too! They must have been ecstatic when you first remembered each of them.\nI hope that everything gets better from here on out for you. Good luck in school and with everything else! Don't forget we're all here to help should you need it!\nBest wishes,\nRelytnevir", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7cqdc9/my_memorys_coming_back_and_it_didnt_really_click/dpsnmbf/"}
