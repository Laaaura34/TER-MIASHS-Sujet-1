It\u2019s the subreddit called happy. Nobody really appreciates you spreading the negativity around. So like I said, I appreciate your input, but don\u2019t make assumptions about someone without knowing them. Just because someone may have hurt you in the past, and you\u2019re too much of a coward to get over it doesn\u2019t mean you have to take it out on others who are happy. I hope you have a nice weekend!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/blz4ch/a_while_back_her_and_i_were_just_chit_chatting/en2veks/"}
