It takes a lot to deal with that type of personal loss. I lost a cousin of mine a few months back. It still hurts knowing he's gone forever. He was only 33. He was more like a brother because our families were so close. We were always hanging out either at his place, ours or other relatives houses. It's a deep wound. Sorry for rambling on. Give those girls hugs and a lot of love. They need you more than ever.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/qh45gg/ive_been_dealing_with_a_lot_of_emotional_pain_and/hialwbb/"}
