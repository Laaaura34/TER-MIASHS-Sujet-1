However when I put things into perspective, I have climbed so far out of the ditch of a situation I was given to start with in life, and with a lot of success along the way. My college debt was paid off long ago, I went from living in drafty apartments to nice two bedroom apts, from depending on ramen and pasta to eating healthy meals (and my cooking has improved!), from 9 to 5 hell with commutes to running my own little business from home, and from some serious mental hell with substance abuse into a relatively healthy dude with a light exercise schedule.\n\nAnd the little things just keep getting better!\n\nI can't have what others have and I guess I never will, but I have my own success.\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4wdh8f/i_got_a_credit_card_high_balance_alert/d66jgur/"}
