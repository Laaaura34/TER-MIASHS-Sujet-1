Actually, it is his car. He got the loan all by himself, and he is currently the only one who brings in steady income right now because he\u2019s letting me get established in my own photography business. So, he\u2019s now paying my $300+ car payment, and this new car payment. However, we don\u2019t look at money that way, if one has it - we both have it. \n\nthese overalls were actually a hand me down from a friend of mine, they\u2019re from Torrid.
