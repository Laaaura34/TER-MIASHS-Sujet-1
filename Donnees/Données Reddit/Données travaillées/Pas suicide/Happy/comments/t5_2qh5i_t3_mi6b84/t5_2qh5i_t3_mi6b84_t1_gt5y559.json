When I saw your picture I wasn\u2018t surprised by the massive amount of awards, upvotes and comments you\u2018ve gotten. Of course when a model-attractive girl posts her photos, she gets more support than anyone else. If you were a 5 out of 10 you\u2018d be lucky to get even one award but you got fucking 25 awards, 3.4k upvotes and hundreds of comments.\n\nNot that I don\u2018t think you deserve it but that just shows the insane edge attractive people have. Anyone who still says beauty is in the eye of the beholder when there are people like you getting so much attention and love because they are more attractive, getting compared to Hollywood stars like Denise Richards, is lying.\n\nJust feels sad to know that when a 3/10 girl posts she\u2018ll get little attention and mostly get nasty, thristy neckbeards lying to her to get in her pants because they believe they have a chance with a lesser attractive girl and when a hot one posts everyone is super supportive and putting in effort to give awards and write super nice genuine comments.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mi6b84/i_have_major_depressive_disorder_and_have_had/gt5y559/"}
