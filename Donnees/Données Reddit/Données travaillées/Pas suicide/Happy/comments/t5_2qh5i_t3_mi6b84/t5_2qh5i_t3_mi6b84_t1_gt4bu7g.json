I\u2019m a nearly 40 year old guy now, was bullied in school and thought I was ugly when I was young. Looking back at photos I realise I wasn\u2019t ugly, I was a stone cold 10/10. The bullies were jealous of my looks and sadly they won because i spent my teens and 20s thinking I wasn\u2019t anything special.\n\nSo yes, as odd as it might seem it\u2019s perfectly possible this woman could be really pretty and just not know it. Glad she\u2019s starting to feel it though, it\u2019s a nice feeling.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mi6b84/i_have_major_depressive_disorder_and_have_had/gt4bu7g/"}
