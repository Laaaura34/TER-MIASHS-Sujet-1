After coming back from a semester off to clear my head, I met with a counselor for the first time. I had always looked up what I needed to get certain degrees myself and chose classes based on that. After seeing the counselor, I went from being on track to receive one A.S. degree in 5-6 semesters, to being on track to receive 3. So, thank you for what you do!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/14w3ta/just_wanted_somewhere_to_post_that_isnt_facebook/c7h2oje/"}
