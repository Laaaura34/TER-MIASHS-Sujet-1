I  never applied myself because I was sick of school, so I took a semester off to just work and clear my head. Came back this semester ready to go.\n\nGirl: I took advice from /r/seduction, haha. The main thing was learning to be confident in who I am, not worrying what others think, walking with purpose, making eye contact, and talking with EVERYONE. Constantly practicing these made it really easy to take the anxiety of talking/flirting with someone and just say \"fuck it\" and do it.\n\nWriting: Due to the other two events, I have just been a lot happier lately, and felt the urge to write one day when I was bored. I expanded on something I had written a year earlier, which was the last time I ever wrote anything, and was actually proud of what I had written.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/14w3ta/just_wanted_somewhere_to_post_that_isnt_facebook/c7h2msq/"}
