You can measure it all you want, in fact it's probably good to know whether or not you're happier in a relationship! But it's also healthier if you can be happy enough on your own as well. Be solidly independent, but don't let that stop you from realizing that relationships can make you VERY happy!\n\nI'm not a super happy guy in general, but I'm fine on my own. The thing is though... my SO makes me much happier than I am alone. Not that life (or our relationship) is all roses and butterflies, but she has the ability to make me smile and feel content (or more). That's just a practical fact and I'm okay with it.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4xn1f3/i_had_my_first_kiss_a_couple_days_ago/d6h3ak5/"}
