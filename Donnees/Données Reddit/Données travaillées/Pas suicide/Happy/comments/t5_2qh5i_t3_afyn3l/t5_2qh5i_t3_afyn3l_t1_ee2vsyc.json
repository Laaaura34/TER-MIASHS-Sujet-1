Congratulations on your clean time. My experience was very similar and I was living a vicious cycle that could have destroyed me. I decided to get a degree specializing in substance abuse, and that was a turning point in my life. \n\nIt was scary to start a new way of living, and as soon as I got through my first term of classes I was shocked to learn that *I could this.* To my surprise, I graduated with a 3.84 g.p.a. I hope you find the same results that I have.\n\nOne of the best tips I received, at the beginning of class you should get a syllabus. Work ahead in the syllabus, because if you hit a snag with class work, it will allow you time to figure out a solution. Also, if necessary find a tutor for the classes you think you will struggle in.\n\nFinally, the class I had a difficult time in was speech/public speaking. That was until I figured out that everyone was feeling the same way I was. If I got up and did my speech in the beginning of class, I wouldn't be nervous or stressed throughout the entire class.
