Way to go. Keep it up and have fun being successful. Have a brother in law went MIA for a couple years on heroin and left us with his kid came back got help and I got him a job with me. He is now an awesome dad that has custody of his kid and the best co-worker anybody can ask for. Still has a lot of stuff to take care of from his past debt wise. Never seen him happier though even though half his pay check goes to debt collectors. He's almost paid off and I have never heard him bitch about being broke once and he lives on his own too for the last 4 years. You got this and your attitude like my brother in-laws says you can't fail. Your a good person With great love for life. Keep up the hard work and it will pay off ten fold. Cangrats man. And thanks for your story. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/afyn3l/200_days_drugs_free_today_on_my_way_to_my_first/ee3lrc0/"}
