I just celebrated one year clean and sober yesterday.  I would have updated r/happy yesterday but I had just posted an update last month and don't wanna use this sub as my personal blog. I start my new job as an at home aid today and my beautiful daughter was born about 3 weeks ago. Honestly, I feel like I'm living my best life today. It's been wild, thank you for checking in with me I love and appreciate you fam and I hope all is well on your end too", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/afyn3l/200_days_drugs_free_today_on_my_way_to_my_first/esbp3zm/"}
