College can be such a great experience if you\u2019re interested in what you\u2019re leaning. One piece of advice, I tend to compare myself to students who are more academically gifted, which can be discouraging at times. This is a bad habit I\u2019m trying to break. Understand that college is about personal growth, and if you are happy with the progress you\u2019re making, that\u2019s all that matters! Good luck and have a great time! \ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/afyn3l/200_days_drugs_free_today_on_my_way_to_my_first/ee3zkre/"}
