It seems sort of obvious but when you have an early class or you\u2019re feeling burned out it\u2019s easy to just skip. I found it helped me to break my tuition down so that I knew the dollar amount I was paying for each class session and think about it that way. (Like, if it breaks down to $200 a class, that\u2019s what you\u2019re throwing away by not showing up, if that makes sense.) Take care of yourself and don\u2019t be afraid to use the on-campus resources like counseling and student addiction recovery groups. I think you have good things ahead of you!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/afyn3l/200_days_drugs_free_today_on_my_way_to_my_first/ee2vs34/"}
