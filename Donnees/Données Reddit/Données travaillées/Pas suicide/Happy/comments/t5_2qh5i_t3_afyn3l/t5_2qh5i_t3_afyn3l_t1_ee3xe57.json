All my professors and tutors were so happy to have students that sought them out in their office hours. Apart from anything else, it told them that someone actually cared about their class!\n\nI\u2019ve talked with a fair few of them over the years, and particularly in less research-focused faculties the biggest drive for them is helping folks learn. If you show them that that\u2019s what you\u2019re about, they\u2019ll reciprocate. Apart from being legendary folks most of the time and well worth getting to know, nothing helps near exam time like a friendly professor!!\n\nBest of luck with the schooling - I\u2019ll bet you have a blast!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/afyn3l/200_days_drugs_free_today_on_my_way_to_my_first/ee3xe57/"}
