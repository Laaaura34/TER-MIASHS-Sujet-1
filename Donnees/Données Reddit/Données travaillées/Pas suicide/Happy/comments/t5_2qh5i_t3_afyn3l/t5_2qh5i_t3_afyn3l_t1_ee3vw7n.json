I\u2019m now 27 and about to graduate. Felt really discouraged along the way because I was older than everyone and have a criminal history (and totally get thinking you\u2019d be disqualified lol). I got involved in some nasa research my junior year and it really helped me forget about that and realize that I deserved all of the good opportunities too. I\u2019m terrified to start looking for jobs with that in my past but we still deserve a shot at it all. I hope life treats you well as you move forward and good luck with everything brah!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/afyn3l/200_days_drugs_free_today_on_my_way_to_my_first/ee3vw7n/"}
