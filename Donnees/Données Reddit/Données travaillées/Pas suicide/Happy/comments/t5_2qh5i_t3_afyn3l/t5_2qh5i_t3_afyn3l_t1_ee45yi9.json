I will say the only professor I ever went to office hours for I ended up editing a book for(in my Freshman year). But that was because I knew of him going in and sought him out lol.\n\nI have a few professors I kind of would like to talk to, but they just feel kind of closed off. Maybe it's just the culture of my university, but I feel like if I showed up to my history professor's class to talk about some of the more obscure issues I have they would just kind of roll their eyes and try and get rid of me. And the prof. I am thinking of specifically went to Princeton so I know she knows her shit, maybe I'm just being intimidated lol. \n\nI am a political science major and a philosophy minor(in my second semester of junior year now) and I love debating philosophy but get plenty of that in the philosophy club(including several professors who join these discussions, guest speak, etc.) and my philosophy classes. My political science professors are sadly(barring the one I edited the book for) really boring comparatively.
