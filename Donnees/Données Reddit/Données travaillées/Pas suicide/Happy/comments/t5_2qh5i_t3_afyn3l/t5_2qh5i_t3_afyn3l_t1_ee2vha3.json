Unsolicited advice: Recovery isnt about perfection, it's about progress. Any sort of relapse should be viewed as a \"flare up\" in your disease. Do what you would if this was a common chronic illness like (which it is) get treatment immediately so that things dont spiral and never be ashamed. It's always better to catch things early. Hopefully you wont need that part of my advice. Know that your future is bright because you have invested hard work. Lastly, never forget that you are a human being with incredible worth and people in this world love you deeply.
