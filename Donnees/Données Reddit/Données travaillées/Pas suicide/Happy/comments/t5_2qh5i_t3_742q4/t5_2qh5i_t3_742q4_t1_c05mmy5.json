There are different design considerations for each, and comparing the two is like comparing a sports car and a pick-up truck. Both have four wheels and get you around, but they serve other different purposes.\n\nOne of the optimizations involves the use of a mirror inside the telescope, but not in a camera lens. That mirror produces out-of-focus highlights that are shaped like rings or doughnuts. These distracting elements in the background don't matter for a telescope, because everything is in focus (at infinity) and background blur is not a consideration. But for photography, images generally look nicer when the background blur is soft and smooth, without oddly-shaped white rings floating around.\n\nTo avoid the use of an internal mirror (i.e. to use only refraction, not reflection, to focus the image), the glass pieces used in this lens are larger and heavier, which drives up the cost considerably.\n\nIf you were to design a 1200 mm f/5.6 lens using the telescope design, it would be called a \"mirror lens\" and cost a tiny fraction of the cost of this one!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/742q4/an_exceptionally_large_telephoto_lens_i_would_say/c05mmy5/"}
