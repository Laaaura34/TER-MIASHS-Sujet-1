I have helped him a lot with his hair care journey, and the best bit of advice I can give is to only comb in the shower when your hair is wet with conditioner in it, and when you get out I would at least use something like a curl smoothie/moisturizer. Congrats on bettering yourself :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ociugo/coming_out_of_quarantine_happy_and_healthy/h3v6cb5/"}
