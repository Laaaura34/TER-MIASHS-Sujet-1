We have been lucky enough that she could stay home with the kids when they were younger. Now that they are in school, she works part-time at the school and coaches and volunteers. She works hard and I try to buy her nice things, and she was so happy to be able to buy me something big and nice that it just made me happy.\n\n(We don't really have separate money for the most part, it's basically always been \"our\" money. Don't take this as she was \"paying me back\" or anything like that. But you know what I mean, she chose to save from her own paycheck all by herself to buy me something and it made us both happy.)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nbgw2w/my_wife_was_recently_promoted_to_varsity/gxz7ddq/"}
