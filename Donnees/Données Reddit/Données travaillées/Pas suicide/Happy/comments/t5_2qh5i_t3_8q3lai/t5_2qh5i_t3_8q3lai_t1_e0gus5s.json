We both were at a point in our lives where we were sick of the dating world and ready to settle down. The only problem was that i lived 300 miles away from her. I used to work in the pipeline industry so i traveled all over texas because of it. I was only in town for another week and i was gonna probably never see her again so we decided to try and make it work just because we enjoyed being together so much! We did the long distance thing for a few months before we ended up moving in together near my home town! After a year we moved to her hometown where we currently live now so that she could be closer to her family! Everything came so easy with us that it was a no brainer! There is so many subtle things that she does every day that reminds me why we chose each other! ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8q3lai/after_3_years_of_dating_i_decided_to_ask_the_love/e0gus5s/"}
