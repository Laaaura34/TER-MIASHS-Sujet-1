It's definitely not where  I live, the minimum wage here is only $7.25 p/h. But almost everything you mention your boss doing is really illegal, especially his not giving you a roster. I think you have to have two weeks' notice about your shifts in my state. And the inappropriate touching is definitely illegal. Of course, good luck proving that shit. The Department of Labor is so bogged down with complaints that it would take them months to get to anything. I know this because I've reported things to them before (boss was taking breaks out of my paycheck when I wasn't allowed to take breaks).\n\nEdit: Oh, should have read the other comments. You live in Australia.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1urx58/you_would_not_believe_the_hell_ive_endured_at/cel9mov/"}
