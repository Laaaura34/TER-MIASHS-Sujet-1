I highly recommend trying to study in the format of the exam itself: i.e. for no more than 5 hours a day, taking breaks about every hour to simulate the testing environment. You may need to try to build up to this type of schedule as your stamina increases. But doing this along with full length practice tests will help your concentration and stamina immensely on test day.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gckym/just_finished_taking_my_mcat_feel_like_i_did/c1mncuw/"}
