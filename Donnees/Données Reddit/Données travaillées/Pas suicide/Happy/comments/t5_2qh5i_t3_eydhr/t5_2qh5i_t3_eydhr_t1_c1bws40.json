In my early 20s I struggled quite badly with depression and sometimes my feelings became quite overwhelming. I discovered that when I picked up my guitar, I would feel much calmer. I don't have those feelings anymore, but still love playing. Looking forward to a session this afternoon actually! Keep it up- your musicianship will always be there for you and you'll always have a worthwile pastime.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/eydhr/i_havent_seen_you_this_happy_and_excited_about/c1bws40/"}
