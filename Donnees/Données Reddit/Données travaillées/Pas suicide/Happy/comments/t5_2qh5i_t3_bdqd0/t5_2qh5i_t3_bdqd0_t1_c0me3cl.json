I used to have some shitty suitemates when I lived at the dorms.  It was a very happy day when they left.  I didn't even day goodbye to those cunts, haha.  \n\nOne used to leave her damn art supplies around, and she was a terrible artists.  The other was an alcoholic who spilled drinks, and the last was a Mormon skank that would come to me a 3 AM for condoms and then cry all morning because she felt guilty for having sex.  \n\nGood luck to ya, enjoy your new, free, life!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bdqd0/im_moving/c0me3cl/"}
