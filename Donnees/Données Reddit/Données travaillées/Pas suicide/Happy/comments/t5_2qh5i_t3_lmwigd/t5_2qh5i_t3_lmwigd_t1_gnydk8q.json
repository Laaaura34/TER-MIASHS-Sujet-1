One was graduating HS, one was going to start kindergarten. It is really neat to watch. We wanted kids close together, but it just didn\u2019t work out that way. But I wouldn\u2019t change our family dynamic for anything. It was crazy b/c the little one would pick on the big one. He gave her candy so she wouldn\u2019t tell on him but she told anyways. He never had to share anything and neither did she lol but they\u2019re both very giving. Your baby really brought a lot of joy to my day. Hearing about your other baby makes it even better \u263a\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lmwigd/my_little_boy_15_months_is_learning_to_fork_and/gnydk8q/"}
