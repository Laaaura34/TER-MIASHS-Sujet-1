My sense of self worth and purpose has improved greatly.  The best advice I can give is what I learned in the first class I took called Student Success. Take only as many classes during the semester as you can handle. There were a couple semesters where I took only 1 class because the content was time consuming and challenging. The formula I follow is this:\n\nTo get an A in the class = 3 hours per credit hour set aside each week for homework and study. \nTo get a B = 2 hours per credit hour\nAnd so on. \n\nMost classes are 3 credits, so one 3 credit class = 9 hours a week devoted to work and study. Its not an infallible formula, some classes require more time, some less. \n\nJuggling work and school is manageable as long as you don't overload yourself. Professors and advisors are also a valuable resource and want you to succeed.  If you need help, reach out. Most will be happy to help. \n\nLastly, self care is most important! Schedule in time for play to help relieve stress. What helped me was to write out a new routine each semester so that I knew I had enough hours in the week for school, work, exercise and play. And if you ever need encouragement or ideas, feel free to message me. We are all floating in this river together. \n\nHope this helps. \ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/htr1lf/graduated_suma_cum_laude_beat_the_big_c_and_got_a/fynpzkm/"}
