He's the best guy friend I've ever had and I had always had a crush in him but never followed through with my feelings. We were always in relationships with other people and extremely faithful to them. I hadn't really talked to him much for about a year and one day he messaged me on facebook saying he missed talking to me and such. I too had decided it was time to get out of the relationship I was in at the time and be single. And BAM! He was all I could think about and talk about. I was scared to death because I had given up on \"the one.\" Within a week of us dating he told me he was going to marry me one day. We've been together four months and I've never been happier than I am right now. He's all I've ever wanted in a mate. \n\nI am so happy for you! It always happens when you least expect it. Good luck with med school!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1n6ujc/just_found_out_my_best_friend_of_seven_years_is/ccgd60i/"}
