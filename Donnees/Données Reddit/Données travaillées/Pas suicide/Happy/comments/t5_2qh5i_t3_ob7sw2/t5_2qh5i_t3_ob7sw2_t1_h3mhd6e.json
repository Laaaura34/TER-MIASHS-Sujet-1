It makes them feel needed and it helps you feel supported. Letting them help you is just as much a favor to them as it is to you. \n\nYour GF sounds awesome and I hope you guys have a great time together.\n\nETA: also, if you want to return the favor, keep her needs at your forefront. When she hits a low point, be whatever she needs you to be and love her the way she needs to be loved.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ob7sw2/so_guess_what_happened_with_my_girlfriend_today/h3mhd6e/"}
