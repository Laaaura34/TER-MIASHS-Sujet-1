Wanted to post a story my Mom would want me to tell you. \n\nI was an Eagle Scout in my day, and years later during law school the folks at the career development office advised I take Eagle Scout off my resume. It was an achievement that by then was well over 10 years old.  And for them, they had some misguided hard and fast rule about really old stuff on your resume.   \n\nI sought my mother's advise (she was the one who made sure I kept up with Scouting) and she told me to leave it, because it still means something to some people.  \n\nFast forward a year later and I am interviewing with a federal District Court judge for a prestigious position in his office. He looks my resume up and down, no comment on my grades or law school accolades, and hits the very last line, in the \"Interests\" section, and sees the very last entry, \"Eagle Scout.\" \n\nWe spent 15 minutes talking about scouting, my trip to Philmont, my Eagle Scout project, and his involvement in scouting as both a scout and later with his children. When we're done he looks over at his clerk and says, \"Maddam Clerk, we'll take Mr. VonHinterhalt.\" \n\nThat job was a huge stepping stone for me and a wonderful experience. All the resumes he looked at that day no doubt had good grades, law school accolades, good references, etc. but apparently only mine said Eagle Scout and that was very important to this Judge. \n\nCongrats on your accomplishment man. It says a lot about you. I hope Scouting continues to help you throughout your life, as it did for me.
