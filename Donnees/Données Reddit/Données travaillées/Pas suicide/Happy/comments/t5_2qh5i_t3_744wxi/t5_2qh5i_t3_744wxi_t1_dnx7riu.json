Behind most good scouts are dedicated parents! \n\nAs a parent, you'll appreciate the epilogue to my story. \n\nThis judge sat in a big city, as most federal judges do. I didn't grow up in the city, so when I parked for my interview, I didn't think to look for the \"Loading Zone\" sign that explained why a spot was wide open in front of a busy federal courthouse. \n\nSo I'm on the phone with my parents after my interview telling them the good news, and they get to hear my live realization that my car has been towed! \n\nMy parents and I still laugh about it. You live and you learn! ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/744wxi/finally_got_the_rank_of_eagle_scout_today_its/dnx7riu/"}
