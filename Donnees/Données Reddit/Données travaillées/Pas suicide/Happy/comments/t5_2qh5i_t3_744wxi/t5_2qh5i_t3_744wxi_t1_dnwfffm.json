For people outside the community, it shows that the person most likely has a solid grasp of work ethic and leadership skills, as well as many different fundamental skills like citizenship, communication, personal management, etc. For people in the community, it serves as a bonding point. Every Eagle Scout recognizes the time and commitment it took to get to that point. Whenever I meet another Eagle Scout, the conversation immediately gravitates towards Scouting- what was your project, what summer camps did you attend, etc.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/744wxi/finally_got_the_rank_of_eagle_scout_today_its/dnwfffm/"}
