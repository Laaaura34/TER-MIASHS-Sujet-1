A lot of its lore is based on Native American ceremony. Each year, the scouts in the troop nominate fellow members who they believe truly represent the ideals of scouting- leadership and service to others. OA has work weekends where they will do service project (most of mine were weekends where we would rehab the local summer camps free of cost.) There are levels inside of the OA, with Vigil being the highest. While Eagle Scout is extremely rare, Vigil rank is even more rare. Out of the 100-250 Scouts and adults who would attend our work weekends, only 3-5 of them would be Vigil members.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/744wxi/finally_got_the_rank_of_eagle_scout_today_its/dnwftrx/"}
