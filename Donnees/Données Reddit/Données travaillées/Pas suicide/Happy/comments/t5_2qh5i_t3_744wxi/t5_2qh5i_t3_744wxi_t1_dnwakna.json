And the \"much higher pay\" thing is a little over reaching. The difference between E2 and E3 is about 50 dollars per week.  You can also get E3 if you sign an enlistment contract for 6 years instead of 4. The recruiters tried to get me to do that by saying things like \"you won't have to take out the trashes or clean toilets because you will be higher ranking. You'll get higher pay.\" Etc. None of which is true. And you get the rank of E3 after 6 months of being an E2. \n\nI do think getting an Eagle is a great accomplishment for someone at an early stage in life. Don't get me wrong. I made it to Life scout before I got bored and stopped going. So not taking anything away from that. But you kind of sound like a recruiter saying it gives you that much weight in the military. It doesn't. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/744wxi/finally_got_the_rank_of_eagle_scout_today_its/dnwakna/"}
