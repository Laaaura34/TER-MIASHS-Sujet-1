She kind of reminds me of mine, for some reason. Eevee is very fragile and timid and is very easily startled, but I'd like to think she's calmed down some since she's been here. I think a lot happened in her past life that was uncomfortable for her so she's easily freaked out by small things. But get that pooch on a lap and she's as cool as a cucumber. Nothing calms her down quite like snuggling up on the couch or on my bed. Love her.\n\nHope is very sweet. Looks like you'll have to invest in some lint rollers, though! :) it could just be nerves, though. It always surprises me how much Eevee sheds. Lol.\n\nI'm glad you've made a new friend :) <3 ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2bzkef/for_the_first_time_in_years_i_now_have_hope/cjatn52/"}
