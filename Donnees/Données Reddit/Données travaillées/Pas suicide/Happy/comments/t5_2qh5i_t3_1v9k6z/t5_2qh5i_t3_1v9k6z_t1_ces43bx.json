If you're predisposed to depression like I am, it gets a bit tough during Winter and early Spring because there isn't much sunshine, so do keep your meds handy. If you aren't, then I do suggest taking those sunshine pills every now and again to give your system a little boost. That said, it's not really that tough to get through. For me, a lot of the sadness and blues are counteracted by the fact that I live in one of the best food cities in the US (food's a big thing to me). You may think that way or find another reason to be happy about living here. And trust me, there's a LOT to do here.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1v9k6z/promised_myself_i_wouldnt_do_this_until_next_week/ces43bx/"}
