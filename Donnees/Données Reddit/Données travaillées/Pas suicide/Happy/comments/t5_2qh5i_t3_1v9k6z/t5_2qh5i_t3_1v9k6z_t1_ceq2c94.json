Humans need to walk, even runners. It cleans your pipes and improves your mood while having low impact. The returns for the effort are much better than running, since it's diminishing returns.\n\nOn the other hand, strong physical activity can get your endorphins high (\"runners high\"). You can try adding some sprints and resting by walking. Maybe once or twice a week. Just don't overdo it, listen to your body.\n\nKeep it up!\n\n(an amateur high mpw runner)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1v9k6z/promised_myself_i_wouldnt_do_this_until_next_week/ceq2c94/"}
