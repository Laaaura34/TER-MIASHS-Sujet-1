They then tried to hold my last check hostage unless I took down a review calling them out for the shenanigans which turned into a screaming match after they told me to come get it (the check) and tried to intimidate me physically.\n\nAnd the one before that was an office job I got because my friend got the HR to hire me, then the HR guy went out of his way to get me canned because she wouldn\u2019t sleep with him in return, FUN\n\nThis is a much better deal \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/c3jnon/started_as_an_apprentice_brewer_a_month_ago_today/erri5sy/"}
