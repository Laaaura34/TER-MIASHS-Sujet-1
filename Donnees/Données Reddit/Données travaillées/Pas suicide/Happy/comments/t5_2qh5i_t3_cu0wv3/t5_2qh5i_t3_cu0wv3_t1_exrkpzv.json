Not tons of bees, but enough that I had to get good at helping people to *calm the fuck down* whenever a bee appeared. Bees don't want to sting you. They're just looking for flowers. If they land on you, it's probably because you're wearing a color that made them think you were a flower. If you calmly, gently indicate that you aren't a flower, they'll just buzz \"Oh okay bye\" and go on their merry way.\n\nIf you freak out and start flailing, they'll think you're a threat. And you *are* a threat when you do that. To them, you're an angry giant lashing out with enormous arms at incredible speeds with unimaginable force. Be a gentle giant instead.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cu0wv3/well_hello_there_my_little_honeybee_friend_at_one/exrkpzv/"}
