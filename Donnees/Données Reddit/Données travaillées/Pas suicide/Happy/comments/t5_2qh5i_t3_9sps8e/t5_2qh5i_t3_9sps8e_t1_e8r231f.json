He looked through my profile pics then sent me a message. It was so adorable cause he was like \"uhh I'm trying not to be a creeper here...\" The thing is, on Facebook if you're not friends with a person the message goes to another inbox and you don't get the notification about it (at the time) so I didn't see it for a few weeks. I accidentally clicked on it and saw his message. I felt so bad, but I gave him my number after checking his Facebook to make sure he wasn't a seriously killer.
