My husband passed away early last year after being together for 14 years and I just assumed I would be alone for the rest of my life, while I was in treatment to clean my life up I met the most amazing man. He is the most loving father I've ever met. I've never known man who doesn't want much more than to be a good father to his children\n He is so kindhearted and loving (something I'm not used to). He gives me feelings I've never felt and brings out the best in me. \nI know how you feel lol, its awsome!
