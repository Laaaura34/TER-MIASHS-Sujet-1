I will take your wisdom and utilize it so my children are not taken from me. I'm so terribly sorry that happened to you and your family. You sound like a strong father and I'm very grateful for your advice. I tend to be a bit more open on reddit since it's anonymous and what not, but I've learned very quickly how evil preys on the innocent and the vulnerable. My skin is leather, my heart is diamond, and I will protect my baby with every last ounce of energy I have. There is nothing more important on this planet than this little bean Im growing. Although, I'm not a fan of the nausea hahahaha", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4rjz4l/just_found_out_yesterday_that_im_21f_carrying_the/d53jxhl/"}
