That all they want is to have sex with someone else, not be tied down, etc. It's very easy to believe that men are incapable of truly *loving* their partner. \n\nAnd then we see something beautiful like this. \u2764\nThank you for showing there are good men in this world. It gives our hearts hope. \n\nAnd be sure to love, respect, protect and cherish that girl - she'll be your best friend and fight through life alongside you, if you do. \u2764\n\nCongratulations on finding such treasure! \u2764", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q962o4/happy_to_call_this_beautiful_women_my_wife_when/hgtyf7t/"}
