Thank you for sharing this and hopefully it gives other people courage. I have had anxiety giving presentations for work at my recent job. The weird thing is, I didnt always have that. I used to give tours for datacenters at one of my jobs and had a blast. I realized it was mostly due to moving to a new place! No sweat. Feeling awkward and uncomfortable can happen to anyone anytime in their life. I love my current job and the projects we do so the anxiety is being replaced with excitement. I wish you well on tackling your mountains!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ik0scn/socially_awkward_me_with_severe_anxiety_relieved/g3hyze0/"}
