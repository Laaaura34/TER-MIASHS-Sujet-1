Be prepared, I\u2019m about six months in a similar position and it\u2019s incredibly mentally taxing. You will find the effort you put in before service ultimately dictates how the night goes. You will also come to the realization that service is the most enjoyable part of the job, so go have fun! I have to tell myself sometimes that at the end of the day, it\u2019s still all about the guest experience. Make sure your diners are happy and taken care of, the rest will fall in to place.
