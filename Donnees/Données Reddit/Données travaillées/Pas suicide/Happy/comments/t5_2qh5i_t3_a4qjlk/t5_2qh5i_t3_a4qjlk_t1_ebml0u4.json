If you find it all in a job, damn you re just a lucky one!\n\nYour work looks like a good mix of those factors (you seem to learn stuff, make friends and spend time with them + creative area)\n\nI have done some 70h/week or more (and i am not even paid by the hour.) But it was ok as long as i was working with my friends and they let me be creative by creating softwares. Plus it was the first years so i was learning a lot everyday. I didn t miss anything...\n\nWhen they separated teams and forced us to use a software without us having our word to say + a shitty manager + i was working there for more than 3 years so I already \"knew\" everything, I definitely wasn t feeling alright to spend all my time in this place. I needed to hang out with my friends more often outside work and I joined an orchestra and played the guitar again. So less work hours for a better balance between those factors.\n\nEnjoy what you like but don t forget this balance!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a4qjlk/i_dont_even_care_im_working_80_hour_weeks_because/ebml0u4/"}
