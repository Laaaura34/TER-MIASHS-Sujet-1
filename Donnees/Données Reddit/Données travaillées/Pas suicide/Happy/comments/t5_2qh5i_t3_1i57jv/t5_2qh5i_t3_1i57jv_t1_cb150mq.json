All along most of the oncologists have said that she'll 'probably' have 'normal' fertility, but so far there haven't been any concrete answers.  She went through puberty pretty 'normally', so that's a good sign. \n\nI did like yesterday's oncologist...she told my daughter \"you know how your friends are saying \"I'm going to get a degree, travel the world for a few years, then concentrate on my career, and think about starting a family later in my 30s?  You might want to start investigating your fertility a few years earlier than that, just in case there may be problems.\"  \n\nShe's going to start seeing an endocrinologist next year (through her aftercare program) to monitor hormones etc., and while we're starting her with a gynecologist in our home city, they're going to be in contact with the oncology specialists.  It's actually surprised me quite a bit that there aren't any concrete answers- I'd thought that fertility was a bit better understood than it is, but apparently not.
