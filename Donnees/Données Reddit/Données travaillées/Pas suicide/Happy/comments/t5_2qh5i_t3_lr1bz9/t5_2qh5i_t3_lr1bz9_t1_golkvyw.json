It's never too late to learn how to cook, or for a lot of things we think it's \"too late\" for. Keep learning those cooking skills, and don't think that you're silly because you're just learning how to do something. Instead, embrace the fact that you are able to learn new things and that you are a better, more complete person today than you were yesterday.\n\nWell done. (Or medium well. Or medium. Look, I don't know how you like your burger. No matter your preferred degree of cooking, I salute you.)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lr1bz9/i_know_its_kind_of_lame_but_im_too_old_to_have/golkvyw/"}
