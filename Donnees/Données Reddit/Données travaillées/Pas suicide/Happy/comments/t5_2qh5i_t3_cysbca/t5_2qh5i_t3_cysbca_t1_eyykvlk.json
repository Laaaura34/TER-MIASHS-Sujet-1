I was able to have my \u201cspiritual awakening\u201d without them. This may not be a popular thing to say but I would like to try mushrooms when the time is right, simply to gain some more introspection. A lot of people don\u2019t know this (I\u2019m guessing you probably \u2018do\u2019 know this) but Bill W., the guy that wrote the AA book, did a lot of writing about the benefits of psychedelics in sobriety. I think of psychedelics the same way I think of books: you don\u2019t find them, they find you at the right time in your life. So I\u2019ll probably do mushrooms someday whenever they find me haha", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cysbca/18_months_sober_from_alcohol_and_cocaine_today_i/eyykvlk/"}
