I do. But I\u2019ve learned not to get upset by hypothetical situations or assumptions. It\u2019s a waste of the most valuable asset God has given me... my energy. So to dwell on the possibility that my actions played a role in past events only does one thing: takes away from the good I can spread today. I believe everything I\u2019ve been through has led me to the man I am today, so I have no regrets. Since we don\u2019t have time machines, the only thing we can do is more forward and improve our lives and the lives of people around us. Dwelling on the past is torturing yourself on purpose, and I quit those kind of behaviors 18 months ago.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cysbca/18_months_sober_from_alcohol_and_cocaine_today_i/eyvtbvl/"}
