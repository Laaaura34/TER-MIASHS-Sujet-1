Understand the fact that life is going to be extremely hard no matter which one you choose. If you choose to get sober, life will still be hard, but the bad things in life slowly become more and more tolerable, and after awhile you will build strength and resilience. This strength and resilience will feel good and your life will become easier because of it. Your problems and hardships in life will become the source of your strength. \n\nOn the flip side, if you choose the path of continued drug use, you will slowly become weaker and weaker and you will run from life\u2019s problems instead of walking through them. Your problems in life will make you weaker and weaker. \n\nChoose your path wisely my man. Best of luck to you! I can promise you that sobriety is hard but it\u2019s so god damned worth it in the end. I hope this helps!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cysbca/18_months_sober_from_alcohol_and_cocaine_today_i/eyvzmh8/"}
