You are a patient friend to your beautiful dog. Could you explain a little more about being too conscious of you while being in the same room? Our puppy adores us and sometimes naps with us but *never* on us. Doesn't let us sleep on him or snuggle. He just allowed us to sleep beside him on our bed. Otherwise, it's far away when he sleeps... we got him as a puppy though. So no history of abuse and hes a spoiled rotten puppy lol ... so not sure if he's just naturally hesitant dog or just doesn't like cuddles?
