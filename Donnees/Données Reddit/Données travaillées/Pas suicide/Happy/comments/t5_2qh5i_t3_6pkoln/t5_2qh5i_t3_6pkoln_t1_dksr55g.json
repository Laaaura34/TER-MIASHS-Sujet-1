Every time I moved she would think I wanted her to do something or was about to scold her for doing something wrong.  \n\nThe thing that mostly helped was her seeing what my boy dog was allowed to do and also no hesitancy in my movements. I found that the more cautiously I moved, the more worried she'd be I was moving because of her. \n\nGood luck with pup!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/6pkoln/picked_up_a_very_skittish_dog_from_the_shelter_8/dksr55g/"}
