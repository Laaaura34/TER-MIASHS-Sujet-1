Of course I also got into a fight at school and my parents didn't really care too much either.  I got suspended, but I didn't start the fight so they seemed okay with it.  They would rather I fight than put up with bullying.  ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/vsoor/my_friends_sister_and_her_boyfriend_both_have/c57h3ga/"}
