I would bet that after years of being forced to accept these kids (I mean forced in the sense that they were there all the way through -- one quote mentioned having been in kindergarten together) they may have developed a sort of cooperative sense of protectiveness or something. At least, I would hope so. Either way, if it was all a joke it sort of backfired on them anyway - they actually did win and they look as happy as ever. And, being the day before graduation, it's not like any bullies would have much time to torment them about it, and instead those two seniors are going to go off into the world with that extra confidence boost, and I think that's awesome.
