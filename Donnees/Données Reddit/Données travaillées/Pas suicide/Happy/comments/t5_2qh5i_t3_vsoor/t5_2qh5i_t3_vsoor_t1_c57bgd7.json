We don't have to pretend that those things don't exist or that everyone is equal in every way, but we should focus instead on capability and potential, particularly in academic and work situations (where this is better understood IMO, but still not perfect).\n\nAs a parent, I see labels applied to children every day and it's like teachers decide in advance which children are going to be shoved off to the side.  I'm sure many of them don't intend to do that, but if the focus was on what a child **can** do and then put the emphasis on pushing every child as far as they will go in every way, then everyone will benefit. \n\nTo be fair, we are already on this path in big ways because we no longer segregate those with cognitive issues into \"insane asylums\" and the like, but with the current educational focus on No Child Left Behind, there is special incentive for teachers to get a lower functioning child classified into one of the special education categories so they won't affect the school's testing numbers.
