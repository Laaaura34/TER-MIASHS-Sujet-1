I just hit 18 months sober, since quitting booze I\u2019ve gotten a decent job, followed by a promotion, in a healthy relationship, moved into a house after living in apartments for 13 years, and today.... today I\u2019m going to the dmv to take my road test and get my license renewed after 9 years without one. I was too much of a drunk before to trust myself behind the wheel. I\u2019m so nervous, but hopefully if everything goes well I\u2019ll be making my own happy post here shortly.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/o11cg8/i_spent_a_messy_3_years_drunk_now_stable_dream/h1yx9db/"}
