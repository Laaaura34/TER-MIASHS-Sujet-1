I've been with my husband 10 years, married 7. Every day is an adventure and we get hangry or annoyed sometimes, but we don't fight. The key for us is up front communication. \"I need to tell you about my day, and I don't want suggestions, I just need you to listen.\" \"I've had a rough day, and I could really use some alone time.\" We have regular date nights. We work off the 51% theory... Each of us tried to put in 51% of the work in the relationship, which means we both end up going out of our way to make things more convenient for each other. And he's so funny... We always have fun together!!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/dk3x7d/i_sure_do_love_my_wife_shes_a_blessing_to_my_life/f4c6p09/"}
