I would end up stuck in there for a few hours for sure! \n\n\nHad a couple double stack Rolls Royces last weekend that kinda sucked ass sadly which pissed me off some! Hopefully the next time I get lucky and run across some they will be a lot better. The last 2 times before this were amazing, I was in my blacked out room by myslef with my headphones on, painters mask on with Viks coating the inside, and blowing myself the fuck up by doing the whole bunch kf deep breaths while you move your head up and down then take in the last breath super deep, hold it, then choke yourself out an falling backwards onto tbe bed. The physical, mental feelings combined with the visuals and overall sense of WTF is prolly the best feeling in tbe world to me hands fucking down. I love watching someone do that shit for the first time!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mnlksy/whenever_i_feel_down_dancing_makes_me_happy_and/gu0c988/"}
