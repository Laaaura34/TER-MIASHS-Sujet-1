In development, it seems like pay is inversely proportional to the interest and challenge level of the work, as you might expect. I have several friends who work crunching numbers and working on algorithms for investment folks in the northeast that make this kind of money.\n\nConversely, in the gaming industry (where I work as a simple web dude) I believe the dev pay is quite a bit lower, though often the bonuses can be pretty serious if the title you're working on performs well. But the day to day content of your work is a lot more interesting, and the stuff you build obviously reaches a much wider and more attentive audience.\n\nIf you want some free advice - don't pick a new job on salary alone. Consider that you are deciding where you are going to be spending the majority of your waking life, and that culture and purpose make a big difference to that as well. I chased the larger paycheck for many years, and it made me very unhappy.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1uess9/my_job_pays_much_more_than_i_thought/cehl9w8/"}
