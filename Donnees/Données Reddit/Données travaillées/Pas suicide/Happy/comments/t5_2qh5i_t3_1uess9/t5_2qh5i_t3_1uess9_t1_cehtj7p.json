Started at $95k per year. I'm only getting $50k per year. I was so jealous. Then I found out that not only does he have state income tax (which I don't) and almost double the sales tax I pay, but that he's paying $2200 a month for a 450 square foot efficient apartment, while I'm paying $700 a month for a 900 square foot 2/2. So when all the dust settles I've actually got a little more disposable income than my buddy, despite almost half the gross income. OP's salary is pretty nice regardless of where he lives, but cost of living is a big deal too. \n\nEdit: also, stock options are a huge uncertainty, especially if he's at a smaller company / startup. He could end up with millions, or they could be worthless. If he's at a larger company, then their value is somewhat more certain, but just ask the middle management at Lehman Brothers how  \"certain\" stock options are (there were lots of mid managers had nothing to do with the issues at the company, but lost huge portions of their retirement plans when their stock became worthless) ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1uess9/my_job_pays_much_more_than_i_thought/cehtj7p/"}
