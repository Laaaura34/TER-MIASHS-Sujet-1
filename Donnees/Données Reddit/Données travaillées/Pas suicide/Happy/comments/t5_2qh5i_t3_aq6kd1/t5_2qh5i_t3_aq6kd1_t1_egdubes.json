It took a lot of work, but it was worth it. I cut way back on expenses and put half of my monthly income toward paying off debt. I also wrote (if I had to guess) about fifty letters to creditors asking for help. By doing this, I got some undesirables removed from my report. If you ask them what to do to fix things, they\u2019ll tell you. Not all my creditors were willing to help, but I only needed a few. I also became an authorized user on someone else\u2019s credit card that has a very large line of credit and a 15 year history to give a little boost. That gave me about 20 points. Not much, but I\u2019ll take it. \n\nThere are many articles and tips out there on how to deal with creditors when your credit is suffering. The main thing is to be persistent but polite, never admit to anything, and negotiate your butt off. I dedicated an hour every week to writing letters or making phone calls. It can be done! Good luck! ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/aq6kd1/i_did_it_it_took_me_a_year_and_paying_nearly_30k/egdubes/"}
