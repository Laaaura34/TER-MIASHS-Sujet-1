I accidentally sold one because I was shitposting on FB and a friend of a neighbor alerted her and she got in touch and offered me $50.   \n\n\nThat is way more than I would have asked for. But I did spend 3 hours on the first one detailing, painting (i used my hands and fingers with a bunch of different shades and layers) and making some oatmeal look like splattered skeleton, lol.   \n\n\nI just do this stuff for fun but now I'm kinda curious about whats beyond that.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pcpvzv/i_stopped_drinking_on_work_nights_have_been/hakqlia/"}
