Her family is a lot more \"conservative\" with their parties, inviting close friends and family while my family likes huge parties. Her's is about 30 people max while my cousins's is a rooftop party with about 150 people so I like to think she would like a new experience like that :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/6bbnyg/met_my_boyfriends_parents_for_the_first_time_and/dhldxex/"}
