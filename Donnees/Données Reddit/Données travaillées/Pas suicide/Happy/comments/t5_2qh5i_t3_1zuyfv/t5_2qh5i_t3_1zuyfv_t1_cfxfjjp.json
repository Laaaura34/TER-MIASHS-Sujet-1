An alcoholic for mother who left me with the man, her father who was my abuser and a father who ran out when I was ten after running uo a crippling debt through gambling . . . Not a great start but my frame of mind has been for years has been . . .  I can either let these things define me and these people win (I chose not to act as a victim . . . It hasn't and wont kill me)or I can take control and be outspoken . . . Within the right setting and deal with the issues if and as they come up. Which from time to time they do.\nLike yourself I don't think people can be this happy without having been through something to appreciate it. \nGranted it consume many people for many years and with the right help I believe they too can become the flower they are trying so hard to become. \nI'm now 28 with my husband ten years and 34 weeks pregnant with our first child. \nYes you will likely be a very overprotective mam . . . As will I . . . Rather that than one second of pain. \nI wish you all the best and if you hit one of those days (you know the type I mean) feel free to mail me. You are not alone xx\nBest of luck and go you!!!! \n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1zuyfv/not_only_have_i_recovered_from_my_abuserape_but/cfxfjjp/"}
