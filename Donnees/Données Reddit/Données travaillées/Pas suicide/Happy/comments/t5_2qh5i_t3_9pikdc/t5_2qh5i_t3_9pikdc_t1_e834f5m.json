They do age out of that. But man, 2-7 withered us all. The first two were very easy peasy. We thought either we were naturally gifted as parents or that people were way overselling how rough it could be. We simply didn't know what hit us. We were wholly unprepared for her. \n\nThat kid is a  tenacious little go getter with a mouth filled with sass. She's super smart and has a really good heart. She's got my favorite kind of personality type. So, now when I meet people like that, I give them serious side eye. I'm like \"I know how you got to be you and that was seriously not cool what you did to your moms.\" Which is totally ridiculous. But, there it is anyway. My kid ruined other people for me.\n\nYours is probably fine. But, I'll say a little secular non-denominational prayer for you anyway. Also, congratulations on being a parent.
