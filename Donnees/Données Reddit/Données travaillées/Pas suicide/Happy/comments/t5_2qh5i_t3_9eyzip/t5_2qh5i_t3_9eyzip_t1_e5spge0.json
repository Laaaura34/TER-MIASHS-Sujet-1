Found it.  At first I thought it was an ad of some sort.  Then read the title and realized that it's a real post.  I love reddit but mostly just lurk and have only commented a few times.  Some of the comments in here are hilarious.  I actually didn't giggle when I saw this but I did tear up.  I love my wife so much.  Yes, I married up in life.  18 years and counting.  Here's to more giggles and laughs with my love.  Thanks Reddit for all the kind and hilarious words!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9eyzip/please_help_me_shock_my_husband_by_our_picture/e5spge0/"}
