How could they even begin to apologize for the damage they directly caused to your lineage- let alone the history of this country. I just I am so sorry this country did this to your culture and admire your strength of spirit and character to not hold on to anger\n\nI was down voted here but it needs to be said- generations of white people benefitted from slavery. We STILL benefit now as a country from the slave owners who used them as labor. \n\nThere should be NO pride in having own slaves... I think it's actually quite ballsy to call people family who were slaves as if they owe you any affection, regardless of how \"well\" they were treated", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mdwglk/i_contacted_the_descendants_of_my_ancestors_slave/gsgg32k/"}
