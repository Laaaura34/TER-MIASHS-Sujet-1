Im always happy unless i am angry, sad or tired(!). Think about it. For me staying happy is a choice. There was a very depressing part of my life (which everyone has to go through) and in that moment i learned true happiness. Also for pessimists that say: after each happy event there is a sad one (i was one of those) i say this. If there was never a sad event in your life, would there ever be a happy one? So enjoy each and every happy moment and know that everything that is sad will go away.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/51rgor/my_secret_to_happiness/d7em2gq/"}
