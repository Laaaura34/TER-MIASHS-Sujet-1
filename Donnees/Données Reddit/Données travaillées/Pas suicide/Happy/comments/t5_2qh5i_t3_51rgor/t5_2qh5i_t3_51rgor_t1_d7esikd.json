Happiness and sadness are like two sticks leaning on each other, they are completely co-dependent, and therefore sadness shouldn't be something shunned- but rather respected as the soil from which happiness can arise. The horrors of the world are certainly horrors, but their very existence is what allows the beauty to shine so brightly. \n\n2. The simple argument that although there be horrors, the last thing we should do is dwell and meditate on them. The apostle Paul taught \"whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.\" I think he was onto something there...\n\nPerhaps, in the end, this approach is a form of escapism.
