I'm blown away with the amount of love and support this has recieved. Thanks so much!\n\nIt went well! I made a few mistakes, but that's pretty standard. I was shaking like a leaf before I got up to play, but by the time I had moved onto the second song I was really into it :) I enjoyed it a lot and I'm eager to play again.\n\nFor those worried about the lack of mask / social distancing; All social distancing rules were adhered to and the microphone was covered with little 'COVID hats' for each performer. This photo was taken directly outside my front door.\n\nOnce again a big thanks for all your kindness :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iuopdu/performing_for_the_first_time_ever_at_an_open_mic/g5p64l9/"}
