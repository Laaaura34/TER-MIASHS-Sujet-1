Unless the other candidate is a retired Navy Seal. If that happens, I am taking a pay-cut and hire them both.\n\nBeing a Girl Scout is not nearly the same as being an Eagle Scout. Nor is running a marathon unless you are interviewing at Nike, et. al.; debate team unless you are recently out of Law School; organizing school activities unless you are trying to get the empty chair at the PTA.\n\nPlot twist: Consider asking your Dad why he felt it was important to have Eagle Scout on his resume when he was 45.
