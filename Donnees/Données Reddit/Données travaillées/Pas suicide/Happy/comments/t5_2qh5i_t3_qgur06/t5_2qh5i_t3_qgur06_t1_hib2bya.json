I was a girl scout for 8 years and also don\u2019t put that on my resume. \n\n\nThis is honest hiring advice for any high paying professional workplace. I think this is a wonderful accomplishment to be proud of, you learn many useful living skills. \n\n\nResumes should have job related work experience or specific volunteer experience and dates on them *ONLY* to be taken seriously. It may be okay for you first job, but after having real work experience I don\u2019t suggest it. Especially 25 years after the fact. I\u2019ll take all the downvotes to offer truthful advice.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/qgur06/finally_got_the_rank_of_eagle_scout_today_its/hib2bya/"}
