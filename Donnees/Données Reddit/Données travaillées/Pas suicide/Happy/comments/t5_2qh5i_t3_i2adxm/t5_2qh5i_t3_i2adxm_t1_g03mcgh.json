I could never get it right. I'd burn the outsides and the insides would still be batter. I'd get so angry at myself, disgusted that I couldn't do something so damned simple. I stopped making them for YEARS! Even stopped ordering them at restaurants because I'd get frustrated with myself all over again that they could make them right but I could not.\nThen one day, I said screw it. Tried again and... didn't go well, but wasn't a disaster. Tried again and one side was perfect, the other had browned too much and the insides were inconsistent, but still not awful and titally edible, so to my surprise, I kept trying, stopped berating myself and watched a lot of videos. \nNow, pancakes are my favorite thing to make, I'm happy when I make them and they come out nicely. Plus, my gorgeous and amazing bestest soulmate in the whole wide world got me a wok and one morning I got the notion to try it to make pancakes because the bottom is flat and huuuge. So now, on most weekends, I make giant pancakes.\nI went from loathing myself to absolutely loving it.\nI went from feeling like a failed idiot to being a mom who could finally make pancakes that are now requested.\nOP, I don't know your struggles or what has broken your trust in yourself, but remember, you are your BIGGEST battle and you always will be. As humans, we judge ourselves mercilessly. Keep wiping away those tears, make more of those delicious pancakes and OWN IT! Cuz you did it \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf73!!\nAnd most importantly, keep sharing!!
