Like the Japanese style souffle ones?\n\nIf you are, it takes a good bit of practice. I didn't get it right until my third batch, and I still occasionally mess up. Gotta put the egg whites in the freezer for a little bit (before whipping) and be very careful when folding them in. I also usually put a tsp to tbsp of water on the pan and cover it after I put the batter in (with a ladle/spoon). The steam helps cook the middle of the pancake. \n\nI have found, however, that even if they don't come out looking perfect they still taste amazing. Especially with fresh fruit or homemade whipped cream. \n\nI'm kinda a perfectionist in the kitchen too, it's a great hobby for it. My girlfriend frequently finds me in the kitchen \"eating my mistakes\" \ud83d\ude05", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/i2adxm/i_am_starting_to_trust_myself_again_in_the/g059tc6/"}
