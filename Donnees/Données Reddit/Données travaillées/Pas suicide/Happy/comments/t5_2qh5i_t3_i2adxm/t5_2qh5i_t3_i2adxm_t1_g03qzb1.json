Congratulations and yay for profit!! \nMindsets are really hard to change. And it's a constant struggle; not a daily thing, but by the hour, all day long. It's a continual process that requires a lot of attention, but man is it worth it! You discover a lot about yourself. \nFor me, changing a mindset is like reconciling with the past and then choosing to move forward. \nIt's a challenge, but look, you're taking the initiative! And that is SO awesome! \nIf you ever feel like you're falling behind again or drowning, I welcome DM's. \nSometimes venting to an unbiased ear can help.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/i2adxm/i_am_starting_to_trust_myself_again_in_the/g03qzb1/"}
