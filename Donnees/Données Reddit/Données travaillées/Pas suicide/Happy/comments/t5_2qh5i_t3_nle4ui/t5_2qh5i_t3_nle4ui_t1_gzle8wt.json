But it was very confusing as everything sounded similar and there were a lot of vowels so I left doing it.\nThen while reading another novel I came across French and German (All the Light we cannot see) and German seemed a bit interesting so I thought I'll learn German. And I definitely love it! It's my favourite language on Duolingo. The grammar kinda confuses me but it's cool apart from that! Spanish songs were were popular then so I thought of learning it too. As per for Greek, we have a lot of Greek terms and symbols in school so I thought it's better to learn that. I started re learning French because my friend was doing. Im not very good at Russian and can say common phrases like \"good morning\" or \"what's your name\", etc..\n\nI genuinely wanted to German so I did see. Plus learning multiple languages allows me to practice any language of my choice.\n\nMy first language isn't English, but because it was taught in school since kindergarten so I kinda know it. \n\nYour English is really good! And, what is your first language?\nDon't worry, you can do it. Good luck :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nle4ui/i_was_really_overwhelmed_with_happiness_and/gzle8wt/"}
