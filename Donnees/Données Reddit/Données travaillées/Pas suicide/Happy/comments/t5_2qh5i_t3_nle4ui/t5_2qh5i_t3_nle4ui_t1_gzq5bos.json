I love Physics Geography and Maths! \n\nSee, most teachers these days just point out the flaws rather than helping to  correct it.  If I were to be described by my teachers, the response would be pretty similar for most of the subjects. \n\nYour English is really good!  But if you want to improve it, you can watch English shows or listen to English songs ( it actually improved my accent!)\n\nIm looking forward to learning Czech! I've heard it's similar to Russian! And yes it's kinda hard but you can speak that very well! \nI don't have a particular first language. I mean my parents families are from a different state. So I have spoke my national language and state language at the same time while also speaking the language of the state from where my parents hail from. Kinda confusing.\n\nAnyway you can master both languages English and German. It will take time. Try reading novels in these languages, songs, movies, whatever you like. \nThere is actually a cool German Netflix series which helped me to improve my German accent and I got to know  more words! Try watching these without captions!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nle4ui/i_was_really_overwhelmed_with_happiness_and/gzq5bos/"}
