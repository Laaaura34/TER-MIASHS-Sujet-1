But I catch just wrong year to be born, because we started in 5th grade and kids one year younger started in 1st grade. Little bit unfair. And when it was said that we should learn two languages, I was one year before finnishing elementary school and they said \"nah, you dont need it\". And when I came to high school, everybody knew second languages, because their school taught them...  \nSo since that I was kinda struggling with languages and can't focus on them (also I'm more math person, but also love my mother language and I think I'm good in it).   \n\n\nThanks for the compliment but as my english teacher said \"You can't write, you can't talk, you can't even read... But you know what you want in that language.\" So   \n\n\nAlso, my first languase is czech. Really confussing, hard language, but i love it.
