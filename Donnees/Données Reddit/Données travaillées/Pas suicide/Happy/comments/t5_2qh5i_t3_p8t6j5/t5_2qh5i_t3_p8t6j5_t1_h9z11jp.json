When I moved out I didn't have the most ideal plan, and it was very hard at first. But a few years later I feel very free of how I used to feel living with my family. It took a little while to feel better but when I go home to visit I realize how much things have changed for me, and how much easier it is to do basic self care.\n\nI say this not trying to brag or anything but just trying to encourage you to keep seeking a way out. I see a change in my friends when they move away too.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p8t6j5/how_i_learnt_how_to_love_myself_at_the_age_of_15/h9z11jp/"}
