However, from day one Deckard has been following me around like a furry little shadow and (as evidenced in this post) loves lap time with her humans. We are still working on the skittishness, but the cat the foster was looking after and the little house panther we have, are leagues apart. \n\nDeckard has brought me so much joy and happiness in just this last year alone. I\u2019m looking forward to making lots more memories with her and just had to share with you all too!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q8pusl/the_last_time_i_posted_in_rhappy_i_was_enjoying_a/hgqsd7a/"}
