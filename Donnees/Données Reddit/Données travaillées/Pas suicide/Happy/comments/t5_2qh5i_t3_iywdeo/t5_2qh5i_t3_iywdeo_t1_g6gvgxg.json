By the time they're done they get off around where they got on and another cow can step up. However sometimes, cows don't want to get off because it's super fun, so the farmers have to give them a little push to remind them to get off so another cow can have their turn.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iywdeo/oma_seemed_like_she_was_having_pregnancy/g6gvgxg/"}
