Whether using caustic paste, burning, or those horrifying cup dehorners, calves are supposed be given some kind of pain management both during and after the procedure. In reality, farmers put up a fight when you ask them to pay for analgesia and often don\u2019t offer any postoperative pain management at all.\n\n[Here\u2019s](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22032397/) a decent Pubmed article that surveyed 639 European farmers. Only 10% used local anesthesia before the procedure and only 5% provided postoperative analgesia. Most farmers don\u2019t even call a veterinarian, they just go at it themselves, despite 70% saying they\u2019d never received specific training. I\u2019ve performed both electrocautery and cup dehorning and even with a lidocaine nerve block, it\u2019s very obviously painful.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iywdeo/oma_seemed_like_she_was_having_pregnancy/g6fppuq/"}
