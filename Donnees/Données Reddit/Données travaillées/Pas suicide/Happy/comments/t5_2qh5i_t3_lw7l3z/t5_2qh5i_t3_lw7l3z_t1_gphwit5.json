Of course, I'm still a very kind person. But I don't feel bad all day long if you don't say hi to me on the elevator. If I know I haven't done anything to hurt you then those feels are your responsibility, not mine. It's so freeing! And honestly, it's pretty rude of me to make myself responsible for your feelings. Enjoy your new found freedom!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lw7l3z/it_took_me_26_years_to_feel_comfortable_enough_to/gphwit5/"}
