She is now 7 lbs 6 oz and a whopping 21 inches long! The sleep schedule is definitely something to get used to, and there are a lot of sleepless nights, but other than that, everything is going splendidly. \n\nBoth Mom and Baby are very healthy, and she is our precious little gift.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mgwyvn/after_a_difficult_pregnancy_and_premature_birth/gt070dc/"}
