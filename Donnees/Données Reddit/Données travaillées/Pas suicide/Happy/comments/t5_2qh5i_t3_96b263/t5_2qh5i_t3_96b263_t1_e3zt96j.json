I left five years ago, when I found out I was pregnant with my oldest.  And I won't lie, there have been tough times since leaving.  Losing everyone you ever known can be a bitch, and combined with new motherhood, sometimes I'm shocked I'm still considered sane!  There have been some amazing times too though, and knowing my children will grow up loved unconditionally is worth the price paid.  Leaving has been the single most courageous thing I've done.  And every time I read or hear of a young adult leaving, I'm so, so proud of them.  To be able to grow up in that religion, and to be able to concieve that your life could be different, and to have the courage to reach for that life takes a special kind of person.  I'm proud of you. :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/96b263/i_was_raised_in_a_religion_that_is_pretty_damn/e3zt96j/"}
