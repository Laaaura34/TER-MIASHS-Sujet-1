Imma put a note in my calendar to wish you a happy birthday every year. No one should go uncongratulated on his birthday, and although i am just a stranger on the internet, my every year present from me to you will be a congratulation, so you feel appreciated and loved, even if just a little more. \n\nI hope you are happier now than in your past, keep your head up and if there is something you wanna chat about, hit me up with a PM. Everyone deserves someone to talk to. \n\nMuch love <3", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/96b263/i_was_raised_in_a_religion_that_is_pretty_damn/e403lr5/"}
