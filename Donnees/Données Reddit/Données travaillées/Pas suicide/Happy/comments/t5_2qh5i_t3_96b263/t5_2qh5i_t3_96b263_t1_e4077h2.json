I hope you have a wonderful day. I got my friend who's parents were jehova witnesses a birthday present for her 12th birthday. She'd never received a birthday present before, she cried she was so happy. She'd seen our friendship group exchanging presents on our birthdays for years & wasn't allowed to get involved, but I knew she felt left out. I asked if it was OK to get her a gift & she was just overjoyed. \ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/96b263/i_was_raised_in_a_religion_that_is_pretty_damn/e4077h2/"}
