Congrats for leaving a cult.  They are terrible.    Consider becoming born again Christian and experience the true love of God instead of the crap these cults shove down your throat.   You can follow God without following a religion or cult.  Heck you don't even have to go to church if you don't feel comfortable with that.  I'm sure this experience may make it hard for you to do that, and that's fine.  Just know that God does not approve of these cults and their ways are definitely not his way and he loves you.
