Save as much as you can about this event -- the comment, the facebook posting, even just this Reddit post. If you want to become a professional musician, I can honestly say there will be a moment where you feel your talents aren't good enough, that you can't make it. This is, of course, all nonsense, but it won't *feel* that way.\n\nStore this away. When the feeling drops -- it could be next week, next month, or next year -- break it out again and remind yourself why you do what you do.\n\nHave fun!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1lk3rl/musical_idol_told_me_my_playing_was_beautiful/cc06sxo/"}
