I keep tearing up just reading these lovely messages, and I cannot express to you all enough of how much this means to me.\n\nLately, I have fallen into yet another depressive episode, accompanied by extreme stress and a difficult breakup. 2019 has been absolutely hard on me, and I've found it so hard to genuinely smile. Even in this photo, I'm running on four days without sleep, have barely been out of my bed/room, not eating well, and had a breakdown yesterday. But today, despite all of this, I managed to genuinely laugh and smile.\n\nAnd I'm so happy that it's showing, and that others can tell. I had posted photos from today on my socials, and the amount of love that I received has been overwhelming! A lot of people call me sunshine and say that my smile is beautiful, and I'm finally seeing that for myself again. I know that I have been worrying my family and friends this year, so I know this was like a sense of relief for them lol! For me as well, and that is the most important thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut again, thank you all for the support!! \u2665\ufe0f And if you're struggling, know that you will be okay. You'll have your rough patches, your highs and lows, but you'll find a reason to smile again. And when you do, that smile will be so bright and you'll feel that warmth in your soul. Even better when people notice that positive shift too! So keep your head up and your beautiful heart beating. You are deserving of love, even if your brain tries to convince you otherwise!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/c33zos/ive_been_feeling_really_down_lately_so_my_sister/erox2ug/"}
