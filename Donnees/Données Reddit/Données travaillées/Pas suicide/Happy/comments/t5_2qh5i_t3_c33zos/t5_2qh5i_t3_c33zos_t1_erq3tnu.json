If you like nature go out to the woods, if you like music get into classes, whatever you prefer but do something, life it's short, painfully short, people don't think often about this and act pretending to be immortal or something when the truth it's simple, we don't have time to waste, so if you are struggling, if you feel like you don't deserve it, if you feel down and in the mud, stand up, fight get out and learn to be loved and love life, think that our of the billions and trillions of beings that have come and will come, only you will live your life and that makes you special to your self, so make your path of life it worth it because you are wonderful and you can be amazing so you will always be worth it ;)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/c33zos/ive_been_feeling_really_down_lately_so_my_sister/erq3tnu/"}
