On the positive side, I\u2019m still getting married and you feel like you\u2019re doing the right thing, so I\u2019ll agree with you, don\u2019t shop at Kay jewelers, buy online because it\u2019s definitely cheaper, and don\u2019t be afraid to get the wrong size as long as it\u2019s big, most places will resize fairly cheap if they don\u2019t have it in your partners size. Always shop we\u2019re you want to. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/91xq3s/10_minutes_from_now_ill_pop_the_question_wish_me/e33er2c/"}
