In the time coming up to it I\u2019ll enjoy what moments I have, and then I\u2019ll use the pain to continue to fuel things that I love to do. Nothing will ever change me, or my attitude towards things, accepting responsibility means accepting consequence, I will give my 110 percent and if that fails I\u2019ll apply my knowledge somewhere else. There is no one person for life, you\u2019ll love many times and many people and many things. I prefer to take the chance, I agree with better to have loved and lost then to have loved at all. My dogs gonna die some day, and I\u2019ll love her now and long after she\u2019s gone and I\u2019ll love her when I get a new dog. That\u2019s life.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/91xq3s/10_minutes_from_now_ill_pop_the_question_wish_me/e372utw/"}
