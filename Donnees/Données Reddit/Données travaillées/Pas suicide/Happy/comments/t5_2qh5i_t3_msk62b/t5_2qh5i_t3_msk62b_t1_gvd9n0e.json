I stopped being ashamed of myself and realized, \"ah well, this is the only vessel I get, I'm sure as hell going to make the best out of it\". Realizing that before I die, I want to have lived a long happy life, not worried about how \"ugly I am\" because in reality, even though attractiveness might get you a head start in life, it's the beauty within that keeps people in your life. I realized that I have goals and aspirations and qualities that I wouldn't trade for the bluest eyes in the world. I love me, and gaining that confidence contributed to my overall happiness and productivity. Sometimes you really do have to \"fake it till you make it\". In the sense that, wake up every morning and look at the mirror. Tell yourself your beautiful, you're worthy, your happy, you love everything about yourself. And one day you will believe what you're saying because it is the truth. I have felt this inner love for a few months now. After I realized that I am more than worthy of love, I became confident in my abilities. It takes time, but if your determined nothing can stop you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/msk62b/finally_learned_to_love_myself_after_many_years/gvd9n0e/"}
