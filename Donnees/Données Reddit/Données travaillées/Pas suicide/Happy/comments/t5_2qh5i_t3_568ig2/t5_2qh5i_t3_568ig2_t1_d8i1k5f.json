I've always been shy, but he has such amazing relationships with everyone in our city and neighborhood. When the Dunkin near us came under new ownership by a middle eastern family, he went in and saw the guy's trainee badge said \"Bob\". He was like \"Is Bob really your name? I know sometimes they do that because it's easier to pronounce, but I'd like to know your real name if it's not Bob.\" Turns out Bob is Bhupinder. And then there's his wife Priyanna and his brother Garesh. And his sons Shashank and Ravi. And we know them and they know us and it's not like we're hanging out together or anything but every month or so when we go in, we always know who is at the counter and have enough knowledge to ask about their lives, partners, etc. And Bhupinder always has our regular drink order on as soon as we walk in the door and throws in a free blueberry cake donut \"for the cats\" because months ago I showed him a picture of my girl cat trying to steal a chunk off of mine (dunno what it is, she loves blueberry cake donuts).\n\nETA: [Donut Cat](http://imgur.com/a/MBrMv)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/568ig2/an_anecdote_about_why_being_a_goodtipping_regular/d8i1k5f/"}
