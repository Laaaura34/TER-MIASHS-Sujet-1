I recommend this to anyone, especially if it lets you leave lawyers out of the picture.\n\nI had planned to give her an atomic tongue lashing once it was all settled, but most of the anger had dissipated by then.  \n\nAnger is usually counterproductive to your ends.  But it needs to be expressed somehow.   \n\nI have tried arguing with her by email.  Our email exchanges flip back and forth from hostile to friendly.  But we are friendly most of the time, and stay in touch.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2xoakp/im_happy_today_because_my_ex_isnt_an_asshole_and/cp28xf4/"}
