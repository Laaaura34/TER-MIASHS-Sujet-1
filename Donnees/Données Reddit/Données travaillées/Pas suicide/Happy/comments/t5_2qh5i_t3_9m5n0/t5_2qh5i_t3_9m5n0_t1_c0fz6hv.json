I always thought it was one of those things that couldn't possibly happen, and then i was (thankfully) proven wrong.  The funny thing is that it was so many little coincidences which brought us together (like that book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell).  The real kicker is how i just knew at the very beginning.  It wasn't like head over heels or love at first sight (although it could have been, she is quite beautiful).  It was really more like i didn't have to sweat her or deal with all the typical bullshit and vulnerability of a fast friendship and the requisite burgeoning emotions.  I just knew that if i gave it time and nurtured the relationship we would share a unique bond that would last a lifetime.  So congratulations and best of luck to you and yours.  Here's hoping everyone else finds their outlier.  ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9m5n0/i_just_realized_my_girlfriend_is_my_best_friend/c0fz6hv/"}
