Keep it going dude! After 7 years together, I still basically spend 23 hours a day with my girlfriend 7 days a week. We're musicians, and we tour together, so you would think that constant togetherness and stress would become difficult, but in my experience its so amazing. \n\nIt sounds *really weird* (especially in this age of 24 hour marriages), but at this point we've basically become like one two-headed, two-bodied collective person who is best friends with itself. When we're  out with other friends we'll tag team conversations and set up jokes or stories for each-other... SO FUN\n\nWe still sit around and talk about random stuff for hours on end and it never gets boring. Yeah were freaks, I know.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9m5n0/i_just_realized_my_girlfriend_is_my_best_friend/c0dht9f/"}
