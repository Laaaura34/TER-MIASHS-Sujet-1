This man pretty much saved my life. Excerpt from my blog:\n>I can say with complete confidence that they have been the happiest years of my life. Before I met him, happiness had seemed like a luxury that I was not allowed to even want. With him in my life, however, I have been wrapped in sheer and untainted happiness. I\u2019m amazed at his capacity to love one person in such voluminous quantities. I am amazed that I am the recipient of such a wonderful brand of love. I am also amazed at how mushy I have become that I\u2019m actually saying these drippy sappy sticky-sweet words. MY GOD WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MEEEEEEE\n\n>Thank you, my mooky merr :) \n\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9m5n0/i_just_realized_my_girlfriend_is_my_best_friend/c0dcnjq/"}
