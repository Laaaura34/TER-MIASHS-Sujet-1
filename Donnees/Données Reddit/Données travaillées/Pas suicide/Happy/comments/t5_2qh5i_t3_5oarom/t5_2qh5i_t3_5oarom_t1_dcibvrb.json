You get to suggest what you would like your job to be, but if the army, air force, or marines don't need you to be [non-combat job A] then after basic training they send you wherever and give you whatever job they need. \n\nI left navy out for a reason. They, unlike the other services, must get you to sign a new contract to just change your job. The sneaky part here is they just hand you stacks of paperwork, and say \"here, sign\". If you don't know how it works, it is probable that you won't be aware that, a) that isn't technically a direct order, and b) you can be a pain in their ass, and refuse to sign.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5oarom/i_am_in_a_bar_alone_in_japan_and_i_havent_been/dcibvrb/"}
