He wrote the story, found and worked with an illustrator whose style clicked with the world he\u2019d imagined, and hired an editor (he\u2019d never written a book before and wanted to make sure the story made sense). There was also the more administrative stuff: getting an ISBN, looking into shipping costs, etc. Luckily he was able to get *most* of that funded through a Kickstarter, but in his case the goal of this particular project wasn\u2019t necessarily to make money.\n\nEdit: For this project he also brought on a group of people from the disability community to make sure he was telling the story in a responsible and respectful way. Probably not necessary for your book ideas, but I like that he did it for this :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mgedjh/my_brother_just_selfpublished_a_childrens_book_so/gst3py9/"}
