I'm so stoked for you that things are looking up.  Keep your chin up, and it'll get even better!  Living with abusive family is hard, and I didn't have it anywhere close to what you were going through, but you gotta fight through that fire and hell to get to where you want to be. It looks like you've really got a handle on what's in the past and what you can do for your present and future, and that's really inspiring.   I'm rooting for you, keep it up!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/3e0ium/im_happy_to_be_alive_life_gets_so_much_better/ctafuck/"}
