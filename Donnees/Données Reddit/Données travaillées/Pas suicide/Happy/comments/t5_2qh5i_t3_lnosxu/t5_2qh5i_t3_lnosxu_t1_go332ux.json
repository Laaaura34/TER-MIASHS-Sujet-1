I voted for rand paul in 2012 and Gary johnson in 2016. Only voted for trump in 20 because there was no solid 3rd in my opinion. The libertarians kept trying to bring in the woke progressives for some reason, and biden is a lame duck and Harris is a corrupt cop. Almost didn't vote at all.\n\nSo instead you voted for the guy that's told more lies than all prior Presidents combined, and whose incompetence and mismanagement has caused a pandemic to utterly decimate the economy, and kill over 400,000 people.
