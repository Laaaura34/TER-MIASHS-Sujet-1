Your buddy us my hero! People obsesse over never being wrong, and never being less astray. But fuck that! \n\nHe realized his mistake, qnd instead of defending it, or pretending he never felt this way, he showed he was man enough to be wrong, and be a better person than he was. He's a goddamn hero.\n\nEdit: Well, fuck. I hoped for humanity. Still do, but this is a predator trying to hide amongst the prey. Fuck him, and that idea. But praise and laurels for those who see their flaws, and repent of them. This man may not be our hero, but he shows us the shape of such. If you are deeply integrated into this hate filled narrative, but you see the weaknesses, and want to move beyond it? Not everyone will, but I, and those who think like me, will embrace and welcome thee. Because fuck being perfect always, but your journey, and if it ends in revelation, at least some if us will lionize your revolation!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lnosxu/my_buddy_covered_up_his_proud_boy_tattoo/go2kcpq/"}
