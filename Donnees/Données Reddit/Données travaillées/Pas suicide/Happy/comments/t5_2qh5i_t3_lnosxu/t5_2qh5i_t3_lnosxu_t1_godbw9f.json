The Proud Boys were among those leading the charge into the capitol on Jan. 6 because they didn't like the outcome of the election and the governmental process that led to it. That seems to be anti-government on the surface, but it's probably not something they would have done if Trump won the election. \n\n\"Anti-government unless the strong man I like is in charge\" is not the same as \"anti-government no matter who is in charge.\" Fascists movements during the 20th century tended to be rooted in opposition to the existing government, positing that major upheaval and installation of new leaders would fix the excesses of the current structure.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lnosxu/my_buddy_covered_up_his_proud_boy_tattoo/godbw9f/"}
