Buuut... we actually have no idea he's even remotely distanced himself from the Proud Boys or any of their ideologies he likely also held during his obvious support phase, where he associated so much with them he was willing to get a prominent tattoo. For all we know, he was a part of the god damn Capitol insurrection mob, and simply wants to remove an identifying mark to lessen his chances of going to prison. I'm not gonna pat him on the back for displaying zero growth behind simply changing a tattoo, which by his own admission he only did because he said it was causing him and his family grief. Note that he didn't say he's disgusted by the grief right-wing mobs have caused *other people's* families, just the impact it has had on him and his. You're right in that my comment didn't help bring him to the table, and I'm glad you're still trying, and it something I try myself *most* of the time, but here it just felt ludicrous.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lnosxu/my_buddy_covered_up_his_proud_boy_tattoo/goaftyr/"}
