So even if the drives go down, we'd be fine. So dealing with RAID-5 or similar in our environment didn't seem worth it to us, especially because it's gonna be hard to find proper replacements of the same drive since the server is older.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/c3q5k/i_just_set_up_webdav_on_my_companys_network_and/c0q19zz/"}
