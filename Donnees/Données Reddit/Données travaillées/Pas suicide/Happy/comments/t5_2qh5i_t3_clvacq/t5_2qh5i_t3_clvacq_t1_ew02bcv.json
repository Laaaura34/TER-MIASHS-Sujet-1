I am so lucky to see the gift of life given to people daily and am beyond excited for your mom. And i love how you thanked the donor. During this exciting time for your family, it is lovely that you recognized the less fortunate person who has allowed your mom and others to continue on. Best of luck to you all and I also am excited for your mom to pee :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/clvacq/my_mom_and_i_are_currently_in_slc_because_she/ew02bcv/"}
