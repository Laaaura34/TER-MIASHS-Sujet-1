For me it's mostly cultural. For reference, my partner and I  live in Utah County. My immediate and distant relatives are all Mormon and I'm not anymore. The politics and laws are dominated by Mormons (prop 2 for example). I'm nervous about being assaulted for being bisexual if I had flags on my apartment for pride. I'm a female scientist and I've rarely been paid the same as my male coworkers, despite bringing it up in different jobs. I'm tired of fighting for my right to be female in male-dominated spaces and being ignored or ostricised. I'm tired of being called by my partner's last name when we aren't married by co-workers. I'm tired of being shamed for not having children, wearing tanktops and drinking coffee. I went to UVU, an open enrollment college here, and was told in multiple classes from classmates that I \"stole\"a spot from a man who needed to provide for his family. I was told by people in my family that a woman getting an education doesn't make any sense. I'm sad that our beautiful state is being abused for grazing and exploiting natural resources, but culturally it's okay- God will fix it.\n\nI'm told by my family that if I don't like it I should leave, even though it's my home. I love the place I live, but it's frustrating living here. I'm not going to leave any time soon because it's my home and I want to make it a place where I'm happy, so I vote and I'm vocally exmormon because I don't want to be erased anymore.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/clvacq/my_mom_and_i_are_currently_in_slc_because_she/evzjc85/"}
