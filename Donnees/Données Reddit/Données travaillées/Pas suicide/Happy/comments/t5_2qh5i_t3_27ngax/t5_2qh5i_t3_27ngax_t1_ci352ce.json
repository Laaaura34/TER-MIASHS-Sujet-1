Take the actor example.  I think most SAG actors don't make a living wage.  Presumably they have developed serious skills after several years.  But it's not enough to support them.  So they need to know that, even if they stick with it, their chances for success are low.  So long as they accept that, or they are willing to accept development of their skills as an artist in lieu of money and conventional definitions of success, I think they're good.\n\nWhat I think happens more often, though, is that people overestimate their chances for success.  I think that's actually been statistically proven, that people *think* they underestimate their chances for success when they *actually* overestimate their chances for success.  \n\nYou might say what's the harm of having unrealistic goals.  I think the harm is that they suffer horrible disappointment and depression when they don't achieve their unrealistic goals.
