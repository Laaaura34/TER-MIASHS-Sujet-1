I've been also re-re-re-re-told how free I am to not follow their advice and then I'm (a moment later) somewhat chastened regarding any problems I have .... as if they were \"my fault\".\n\nSo making oneself the teacher is not a \"free\" thing at all.  It has consequences.  It gains respect or it shows genuine disrespect to the student if the teacher does not have helpful truth at all.\n\nI do not consider the world of \"guruing\" people to be a fun sport.  It is clearly unwise and selfish to do something so assertive without listening to the students ... and the ability of people to ignore where their happily-and-confidently told teachings fail, or (*more importantly*) where their teachings are hypocritically not followed by the teacher herself ... makes me unwilling to be satisfied with \"I can choose my own truth\".\n\nThe evangelists of New Age have told me about my freedom-to-not-accept-their-beliefs forever, but they have still looked down on me (clearly and verbally) with countless claims that they are Right and I am Wrong with my approach.\n\nPreaching to others, for good or bad, makes you a preacher.  If you mean it, you cannot retreat a moment later and claim it means nothing.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/27ngax/how_to_stop_negative_thoughts_and_steadily/ci3bfd0/"}
