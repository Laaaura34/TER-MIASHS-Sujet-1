Truth be told life on 1.5 legs w/o crushed limb sensation (most awful pain I ever experienced) is better than trying to brave it with 2 legs. Having a stump instead of your original \"born with\" leg is challenging, being dependent on some device that is basically stump to shoe adapter, with no option of just waking up and going about my business like i used to be able to for 29 years. But once you look past all these minor inconveniences and just accept it as the new normal, and you got good fit to your prosthetic - there's really nothing stopping you from being the best possible version of yourself. That's where I'm at these days. I got my life granted back to me, now my challenge is to live it to it's fullest potential. I wish you get your amputation ASAP and you get your life back, back to physical activity, back to walking and roaming. And most of all I wish you experience 0 phantom pains. Amputation is not the end of your happy life. It's a new chapter, and whether it's happy or sad is all up to you and how you choose to process it. I hope you take it well and see the good side of things in no time.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/dzzt4w/i_walked_on_a_treadmill_for_the_first_time_in/f8cupda/"}
