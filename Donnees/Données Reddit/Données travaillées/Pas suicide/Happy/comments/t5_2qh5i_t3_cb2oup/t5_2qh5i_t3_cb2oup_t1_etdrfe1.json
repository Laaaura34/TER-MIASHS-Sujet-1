By the time I figured that out my situation was starting to improve (I was only truly food insecure for about 4-5 months but damn was it hard). We discussed a lot of ideas with the administration such as providing the leftover food from the dining halls for struggling students to have or allowing students to donate leftover dining punches to a free lunch program. The biggest part of the discussion was finding ways to help the students in need without inviting freeloaders but also allowing students to keep their dignity. Honestly the hardest part about struggling financially is feeling embarrassed and ashamed about it and being afraid of asking for help, or alternatively feeling like you don't deserve help that is offered. Because I go to a school that has A LOT of wealthy students and my family is helping me pay for rent (to what extent they can, we aren't well off), I just felt like it was unfair for me to take resources from the poorer parts of the local community.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cb2oup/after_a_horrible_semester_where_i_experienced/etdrfe1/"}
