I take her to gardens and museums, and only when it's free because we don't have much money. Hence, why I thought this post was nice. When you come from a low income household, like myself, I do like to dream that someday I can buy my mom something nice because I can't give her something expensive now. Don't assume everyone buys expensive things all the time to show people they care about them. Perhaps if someone does want to buy their parents something nice all the time, that's okay too. Don't be biased and think that your way of doing things is the correct way. People do what they think is best for them & don't hate because you're stuck in your ways.
