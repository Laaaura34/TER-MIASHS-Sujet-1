Honda, while not a mediocre car, isn\u2019t a a luxury car. The topic we were discussing was if luxury cars were worth it on the basis of performance since you don\u2019t think bags are but you do think it is in cars. My point is luxury cars offer no more functionality than designer handbags so you can\u2019t be someone who wants a nice car but then shits on designer clothes and accessories. Yeah, some luxury cars do have better performance in the way designer bags are higher quality, but unless you are only driving it on tracks or the autobahn, you cannot see the potential of the car so it really isn\u2019t more functional than cheap car", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9lqoqj/my_mom_is_one_of_the_hardest_working_individuals/e7cxkzf/"}
