It's a bit dirty and scuffed but instead of people thinking it's ragged, everyone thinks it's vintage, like it came that way. \n\nMeanwhile her friend has a few that they baby and never use. Maybe once a year at a special social event. I'm like, ok you paid all that money and used it 4 times in the past 10 years while my wife has used it like a hundred times. \n\nI figure for the next 20 years, the cost per use of her bag is like 5 bucks. The other ones? Hundreds of dollars per use. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9lqoqj/my_mom_is_one_of_the_hardest_working_individuals/e796p7k/"}
