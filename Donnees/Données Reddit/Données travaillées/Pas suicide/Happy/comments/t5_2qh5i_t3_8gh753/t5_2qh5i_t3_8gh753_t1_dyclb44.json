The padding is a little rough (as expected) but they sound just as great, if not better, than when I got them, and they are more comfortable than when I got them as well because they stretch out over time to the shape of your head. The next pair of headphones I buy will be another pair of these when mine break in a freak accident (which I'm convinced is the only way that they'll ever break), because these sound amazing and are durable as hell. You won't be disappointed with the M50s.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8gh753/well_folks_today_i_have_been_sober_for_one_year/dyclb44/"}
