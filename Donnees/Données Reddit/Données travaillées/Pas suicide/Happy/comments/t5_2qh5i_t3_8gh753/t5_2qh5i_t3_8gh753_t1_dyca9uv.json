Is there a word for people who do that? My dude up here been sober a year and deserves kudos and accolade, not more baggage. Were all happy to support you and be there for you through your journey as well, but cant you take 2 seconds from yourself and congratulate this fuckin guy? You more than most seem to know first hand how hard what hes done is, couldn't you just say good job and take your own stuff to your own thread?\n\nCongrats OP, shit is wicked hard. Cant imagine the pride you feel, you deserve it. Now I'm going to go fire up a bowl. Cheers.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8gh753/well_folks_today_i_have_been_sober_for_one_year/dyca9uv/"}
