Then I decided to have a few beers one night. Then the next night I was back with my friends pounding whisky shots. I gained 40lbs back and put myself further into debt and wasted the last 5 months. I\u2019ve been sober since Friday and have a good feeling about it this time. Definitely want to go a year and have that satisfaction of being sober. I\u2019m trying to quit smoking weed for now as well so I can pass a drug test for a good job. Good luck things will get better.
