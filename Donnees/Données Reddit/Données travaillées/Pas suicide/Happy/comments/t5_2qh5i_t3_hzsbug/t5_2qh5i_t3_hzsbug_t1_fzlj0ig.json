Fierstly, congratulations on your Masters. I know firsthand how much work you did for that. I hope you celebrated and are proud of yourself. \n\nI\u2019ve also been taking time to appreciate the more simple things and the people around me. Isn\u2019t it amazing what being grateful can do for your mood? They say that feeling gratitude puts you in the highest frequency! In fact, I started writing out things I\u2019m grateful for, at least two to three times a week, and it\u2019s done wonders for me! \n\nLastly, stay positive about a position. You will find one at the perfect time! I believe that!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/hzsbug/ive_had_a_pretty_rough_summer_but_im_so_happy/fzlj0ig/"}
