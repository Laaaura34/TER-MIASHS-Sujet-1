I got my degrees back in 2010 in German and Philosophy and couldn't find work, so I took an ESL teacher training course as a stopgap, and I hate it more than I thought I would.  My dream is to do research in behavioural neurobiology, but I can't afford to go back to school yet (or, perhaps, ever).  I need a dose of optimism and enthusiasm.  Can you fix me up?", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/xv2nz/after_25_years_of_part_time_work_i_finally_got_a/c5pw0ee/"}
