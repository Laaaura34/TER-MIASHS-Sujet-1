I felt like the Queen of fucking Sheba this afternoon when I deposited a check that brought my account up to just under $1500 (soon to be down a significant chunk when I pay my rent).  I'm not looking at graduate programs, there's no way I could wiggle my way into one.  I aim to start over completely afresh with a second Bachelor's degree, which will be costlier in finances and in effort in the long run, but also more likely to get me where I want to be.  My background in Philosophy is exactly what led me to go down this route, interestingly enough.  I started off being into all the Existential stuff, then took a turn for Phil of Mind toward the end of my undergraduate degree.  And I've always had kind of an analytical, scientific approach to things, so it seemed to develop kind of organically.  As for the teaching, it's the whole field I have no interest in.  I'm aware that teaching in some capacity will probably be inevitable as part of my academic life, but that's more of a means to an end, a necessary evil, as it were, and not a self-contained thing.  (Though I have to say I'd rather teach anything than ESL!)  To answer your last question, it is human neurobiology I'm interested.  But bats are a good start!
