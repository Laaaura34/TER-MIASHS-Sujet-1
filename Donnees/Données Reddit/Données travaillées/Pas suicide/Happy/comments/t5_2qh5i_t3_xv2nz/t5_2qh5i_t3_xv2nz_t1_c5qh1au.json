However, it's a strange thing. White-Nose has not been detected in our cave since then, and the bat population (generally around 70-80 pipistrelles during the winter) is fine.\n\nWe don't know why this is the case, and that is part of what my fellow grad is trying to figure out. \n\nLemurs! I think they're neat mammals. If I ever did, I would probably take the opportunity to research them... them or those giant fruit eating bats! ;)  As for you having poor vision? That would be amusing since I have very poor hearing, but ... bat calls are beyond our hearing range, anyway.  I received a rather amusing question during the presentation of my thesis research by a very well-meaning and curious undergrad: \"Is it frustrating to research something you cannot hear?\"", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/xv2nz/after_25_years_of_part_time_work_i_finally_got_a/c5qh1au/"}
