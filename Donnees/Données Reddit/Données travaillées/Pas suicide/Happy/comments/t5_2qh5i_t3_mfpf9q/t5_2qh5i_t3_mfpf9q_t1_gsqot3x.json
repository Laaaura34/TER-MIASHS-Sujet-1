Don't get me wrong. You look great.  But I agree with you that you were never meant to fit a stereotype of beauty.  You've got your own type of beauty and it's a good idea to embrace that.  Remember that you are blazing your own path so there's going to be successes and failures.  Don't let the failures kill your momentum.  Just try something else until you're happy with your look.  You've got a lot of potential physically.  I hope you're able to weaponize it mentally.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mfpf9q/ive_been_hating_myself_for_my_whole_life_i_was/gsqot3x/"}
