Her nicname was Queenie. She got really depressed near the end of the year about going home. Like, REALLY depressed. I finally got her to talk to me about it and she told me that she had gained 15 pounds in America and was a size 6 now, she was fat. I was a little shocked- she was sooo thin. Beautiful. But when Queenie's mom saw her pictures from the school year, she called to tell Queenie that she had gotten america fat and should stop eatting before coming home looking like that. That all her friends and family would make fun of her like all the exchange students who get fat. \n\nA size 6. It blew my mind. My german/irish bloodline basically guaranteed thick thighs and a sturdy frame- averaged a 12 over my life. When i was a size 6 briefly after a long illness, you could see my ribs through my shirts, it was not healthy. Queenie was tiny all over, almost waif-like. Even as a size 6 her belly was flat, her figure small and willowy. And she knew for a fact that when she got home she would be humiliated over and over for going from a size 4 to a size 6 in a year while living with a midwestern family who liked meat and potatoes and pizza. That fact would mean more to most others than anything she learned or her other experiences. She told me the only people she thought would be nice to her were other fat people. \n\nYeah. The social pressure on Asian women is overwhelmingly obnoxious.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mfpf9q/ive_been_hating_myself_for_my_whole_life_i_was/gsr8tdh/"}
