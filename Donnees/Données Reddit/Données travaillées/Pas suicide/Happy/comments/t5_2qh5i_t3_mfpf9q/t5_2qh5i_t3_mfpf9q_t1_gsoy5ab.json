Women are \"beautiful,\" and that is not just external --  not just physical.\n\nI've dated or married many women and I don't think any were \"pretty\" but they all were beautiful in one way or another.  Most were very intelligent -- a prime source of beauty.  Most had personalities that were appealing to me -- another source of beauty.  Most had particular interests they spent time on -- yet a third source of beauty.  I'm pretty sure I could perceive the beauty of some of them better than they could themselves.\n\nSo live for yourself and attend to your particular interests and stop worrying about how you are perceived by the world.  This is not to say you should cut yourself off from the world and never to help others -- quite the contrary.  Just don't let the world dictate your self-perception.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mfpf9q/ive_been_hating_myself_for_my_whole_life_i_was/gsoy5ab/"}
