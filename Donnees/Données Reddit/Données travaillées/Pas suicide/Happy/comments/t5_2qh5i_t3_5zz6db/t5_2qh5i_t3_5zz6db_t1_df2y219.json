Come! I'd be happy to give you like a little mini tour kinda thing, show you around a bit. Warsaw doesn't have a huge amount of touristy stuff but it's definitely worth checking it out. I usually recommend a 3-4 day stay, that's enough to get a feel for the place and see the main sights. Like a long weekend kinda thing. Pretty cheap too, if you're on a US/Western European income level!\n\n*edit: I'm a wee bit envious that you get to go to Prague... I'm horribly ashamed to say that I've never been, which is ridiculous considering my love of beer and pretty cities. Really got to get off my ass and check it out.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5zz6db/i_got_promoted_today_after_5_years_of_hard_work/df2y219/"}
