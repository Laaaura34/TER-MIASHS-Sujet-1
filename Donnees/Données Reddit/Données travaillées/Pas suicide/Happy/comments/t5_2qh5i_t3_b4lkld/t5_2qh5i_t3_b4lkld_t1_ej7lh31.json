She\u2019s really self-aware with an ability to laugh at herself, She\u2019s just so funny, chill and smart. I love hanging out with her. \n\nI love that my SO is just a genuinely nice guy, and I admire the intense focus & dedication he has. He is a single dad to 3 kids, works f/t at a demanding job, and he\u2019s managed to get 2 Master\u2019s Degrees & start his Ph.D program in the last few years, while attending remotely at night. Just the idea of all he does on a regular basis exhausts me. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/b4lkld/tell_me_something_you_love_about_your_boyfriend/ej7lh31/"}
