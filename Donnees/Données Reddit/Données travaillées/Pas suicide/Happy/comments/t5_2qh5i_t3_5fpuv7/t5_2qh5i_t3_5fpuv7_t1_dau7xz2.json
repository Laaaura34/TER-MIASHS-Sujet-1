As a childhood cancer survivor my eggs were severely damaged by the chemotherapy. We've gone through every fertility treatment there is. Finally my doctor told us we have to get an egg donor. I was devastated. But after more waiting we now have 7 amazing quality frozen embryos! After one miscarriage following our first transfer, we are now 5 weeks pregnant after our second!

Even for a healthy normal couple six months is pretty fast.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5fpuv7/i_cant_keep_calm_im_going_to_be_a_dad_after/dau7xz2/"}
