I know I have. Unfortunately people will keep thinking they're being smart to say such things. But I'm glad you're both able to tune it out. Don't let them put doubt in your minds about what you both want to achieve.\n\nCongratulations to your girlfriend! Whatever direction she takes in art, I'm sure she'll succeed at it. Thank you for sharing this happy photograph, it brings back memories of finishing my degree. I remember feeling after graduation that I've only just started, and things would only grow from there. For what it's worth, it's been almost a decade and I don't regret getting a fine arts degree.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8hbto8/my_girlfriend_just_finished_her_degree_in/dyj4emd/"}
