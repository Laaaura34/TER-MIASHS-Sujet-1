Lol. No. I call it like it is.\n\nI'd be salty if I was in debt and couldn't land a job with a art degree immediately. \n\nAlso last I checked, not many are hiring and most would require a big resume of past experiences of previous art/ jobs/gigs. I can also tell you that people hire based on that criteria and dont really care about degrees in the art field. That's actually a fact.\n\nYou see this lady never really needed said art degree based on her work. Everything new she learned at school can be looked up at Google and could of saved her A LOT of money in the long run.\n\nBut nice attempt of what I think is a troll post. Whatever.
