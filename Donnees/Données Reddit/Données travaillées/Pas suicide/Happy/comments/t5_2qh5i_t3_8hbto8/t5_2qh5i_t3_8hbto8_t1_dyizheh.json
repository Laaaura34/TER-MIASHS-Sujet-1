I wasn't planning on going to art school anyways so I didn't care. His skill level was very...unrefined in HS. He got into the fairly prestigious art school with help from me and a few of our other friends. I was SHOCKED by how much he improved from his time at that school. He definitely surpassed my talent. By the time he was done, he was making nearly photo-realistic self-portraits. Anyways, yes a degree can be very helpful.
