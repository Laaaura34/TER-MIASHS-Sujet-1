It's a huge gamble and winning the bet means you get to scrape by as an artist. Terrible life decision. Infinitely better to just not go to college.\n\nIt's funny how everyone on here cries about student loans and then defends art degrees.\n\nArt is something that you spend your free time doing until you can support yourself with it. You don't go balls deep on something totally unrealistic at 18 years old and then expect to make money off it. Congratulations, you wasted your schooling years and acquired debt that is going to sap your already sabotaged income for the next decade. But on the plus side, you know a lot about painting.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8hbto8/my_girlfriend_just_finished_her_degree_in/dyiwv51/"}
