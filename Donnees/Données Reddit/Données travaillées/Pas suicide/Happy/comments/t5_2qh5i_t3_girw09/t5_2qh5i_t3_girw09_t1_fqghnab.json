I am a music teacher and a percussionist by \u201cfirst instrument\u201d.  Things that made me happy, in no particular order:\n1. The older gentleman on the inner marimba part. Just chillin\u2019 and holding down the group. Like an awesome grandpa \n2.  The dude with the clock over his head (often bottom left) whose grip i would normally try to teach out of kids but obviously this dude has MADE IT and knows his shit (let\u2019s be real. He knows way more than me)\n3.  That xylophone soloist. Slow clap with hats off, my friend. You are gifted. \n4.  A double traditional grip for the washboard?  I want to meet this man and ask him why.  I don\u2019t question him bc he is magical.  But why? \n5.
