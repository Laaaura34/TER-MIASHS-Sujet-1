I'm about to head out as well but read over most of it quickly. It seems like sex is the main foundation in the bonobo's society, more so than humans. But I feel like sex for them encompasses all types of the love they experience, especially a sort of philia love (refers to \"brotherly\" love). \n\nIt did say their was a type of gain that was thought they get by their sexual behaviour, though same goes for humans. It seems to me that rather than the bonobos being overly-erotic, they strip sex from the erotica and make it out to be no more than a friendly handshake (as most animals do). Makes me think of Brave New World in a way. The question is why do they love handshakes so much.\n\nEdit: Though the fact they mate facing each other and such if very interesting. That was one of the main points as to why Zeus rearranged our genitals, according to Aristophanes (in the Symposium). I'll have to look more into the bonobos ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5cr29y/i_got_a_100_on_my_philosophy_essay/d9yug9d/"}
