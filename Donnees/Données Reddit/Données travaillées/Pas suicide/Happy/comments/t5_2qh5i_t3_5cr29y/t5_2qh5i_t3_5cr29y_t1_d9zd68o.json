I would have been down to go into much more detail in the essay, but with a particular word count limit I don't think I would have had enough room to fill any gaps they would have created. If I wanted to argue that only unintelligent animals don't experience eros I would have to explain why I think some do, or I would have to just briefly state the fact without substance. The main purpose of the essay was to show that you have satisfactory analytic and reasoning skills, less about the context.\n\nI don't mean to project my position as though it's a scientific fact. I know that I pretty much know nothing about non human animals.\n\nThough eros is not simply compassion, I wasn't arguing that animals don't feel any kind of love at all.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5cr29y/i_got_a_100_on_my_philosophy_essay/d9zd68o/"}
