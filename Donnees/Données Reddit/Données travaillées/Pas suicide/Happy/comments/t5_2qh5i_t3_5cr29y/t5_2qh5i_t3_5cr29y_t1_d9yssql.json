And I'm sure humans can have sex without eros, though generally there's at least a slight amount of erotic romantic inclination. And I would agree in that animals do feel love, and the ones with higher order thinking probably do feel a form of romantic love. But not to the extent of humans, and not in the same way as humans. \n\nOne philosopher, Solomon, made a strong point in saying that romantic love only can emerge with relative liberation and equality for women. And that there is a  unique shared sense of equality between romantic lovers. In animals, equality is essentially meaningless and they do not have the ability to keep their species alive without the roles each of them take on, and so on. Therefore, romantic love, in the sense Solomon was describing, does not exist between animals. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5cr29y/i_got_a_100_on_my_philosophy_essay/d9yssql/"}
