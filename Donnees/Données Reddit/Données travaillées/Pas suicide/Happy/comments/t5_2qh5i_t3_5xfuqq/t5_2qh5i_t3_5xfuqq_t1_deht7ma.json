But of course the ones I'll rec are my faves not hers, so she might not like them as much as I do. \nDinosaur Jr (Anything off the \"Where you been\" album)\nIf she likes the Pixies she might also like Sugar, particularly the \"Copper Blue\" album.\nThe Breeders \"Last Splash\" album.\nPrimal Scream \"Screamadelica\" album. \nI'd probably also include songs by Pulp (a little soul and babies are my faves) Belly, Blur, Radiohead, Hole, Nick Cave, I could go on all day to be honest, anyway hope you have fun making the mix tapes! \n\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5xfuqq/my_mom_is_my_best_friend_and_i_love_her_so_much/deht7ma/"}
