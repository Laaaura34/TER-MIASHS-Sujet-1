My husband picked it out on his own and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it, but in the event you and your beautiful-bride-to-be aren\u2019t aware, aquamarines do not generally stand up to daily wearing or depending on the lifestyle of the wearer. They are 7.5-8 on the Mohs scale. Diamond are 10. Sapphires, rubies, emeralds are 9. \n\nI wore my ring unaware and it became scratched easily within a few weeks. I do have a job and lifestyle whereby I use my hands a lot (gardening, animal welfare, general life). We ultimately decided to pay to shave the stone down to rid the scratches and I now only wear it on special occasions. \n\nI love my ring, but wished we would have known this from the start. I now wear a bespoke and practical, but cool looking, band of titanium with bands of reclaimed hardwood. \n\nSorry to be the asshole. :(", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/oqpu2h/i_took_a_cute_girl_to_the_ny_botanical_garden_and/h6fjq3h/"}
