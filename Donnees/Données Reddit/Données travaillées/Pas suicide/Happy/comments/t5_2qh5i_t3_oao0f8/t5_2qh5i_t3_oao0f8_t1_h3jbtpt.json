I\u2019m almost at the one-year mark for my first year of nursing. The amount I\u2019ve learned and grown in the past year is crazy. Just keep in mind that you\u2019ll likely feel as though you know nothing for about 6 months, and that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s how it is for everyone. It does start to get better. And if you hate your unit (assuming you\u2019re starting with bedside nursing), find a different unit. Don\u2019t suffer. I switched to ICU after 7 months on a telemetry unit and I\u2019m so glad I did. This isn\u2019t the last stop for me, but it\u2019s a huge improvement. \n\nAnyway, congrats again! You\u2019re doing great!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/oao0f8/updating_on_a_post_i_made_3_years_ago_i_graduated/h3jbtpt/"}
