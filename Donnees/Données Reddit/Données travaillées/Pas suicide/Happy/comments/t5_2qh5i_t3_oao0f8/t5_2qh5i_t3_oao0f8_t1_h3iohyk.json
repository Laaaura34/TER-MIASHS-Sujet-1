I graduated first in my class in May and I start working in July. I have really been struggling with my mental health so making this posts seems a little ironic. I was in a tough life situation when I got into nursing school and although I am so proud of myself -  it was bittersweet in a lot of ways because my accomplishments were fear based. My life is so different now it is crazy to think I will actually have a live-able income in a month. My outlook on life changed so much, and although I have hard days all in all life is beautiful \n\nthank you for all the support and positivity sent my way", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/oao0f8/updating_on_a_post_i_made_3_years_ago_i_graduated/h3iohyk/"}
