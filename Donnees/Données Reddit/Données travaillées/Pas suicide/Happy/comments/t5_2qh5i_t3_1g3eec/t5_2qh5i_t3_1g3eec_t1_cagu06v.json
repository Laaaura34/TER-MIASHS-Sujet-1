You will bask in the sunlight one moment, be shadowed on the rocks the next. What makes you a man is what you do when that storm comes. You must look into that storm, and shout as you did in Rome, 'do your worst for I will do mine!' Then the fates will know you as we know you, as marvelousthings88's son, the man.\"\n\nI don't know the challenges he will go through in life but I was born with a great many challenges and I am beating them one, by one, by one. My advice to you is to give him your everlasting love, faith, and support. Let him do what he wants, let him run, let him play, let him make friends, let him fall in love, let him grow up to be all the things he wants to be. Miracles are not given, they are made.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1g3eec/we_finally_get_to_take_this_little_guy_home_on/cagu06v/"}
