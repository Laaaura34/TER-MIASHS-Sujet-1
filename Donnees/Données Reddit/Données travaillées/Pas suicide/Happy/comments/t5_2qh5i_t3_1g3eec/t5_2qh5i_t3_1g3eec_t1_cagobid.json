Let me explain two things to you:\n1.  Very few infants are actually \"pretty\".  They are red and wrinkly.  Their hair sometimes grows in weird patches and some of them have ridiculous cone heads.  Oh, and they shit themselves all.the.time.\n2.  They are all beautiful anyway.  Why?  Because they are the most innocent form of human life.  They are these amazing little creatures.  You look at them and think, \"holy shit, this whole person grew from a cluster of cells\".  They are so full of hope and potential and promise.  They love you unconditionally.  They are the essence of everything that is beautiful about life.\n\nI'm pretty sure if you polled 200 people the majority would agree.  You can go ahead and be a dick if you want, but at the end of the day, what are you proving?  How are you making a positive difference in your life or anyone else's life?
