Secondly, severe depression to me is categorized in a way that is determined differently for each person's experience. For me the severity came into play when I didn't hold a job. Im not someone who likes to sit around, but however these past 7 months... thats all I wanted to do. I was constantly triggered by anything and everything that made me felt attacked... I was always irritated, even after a good nights rest.. I'd just start crying for no reason.. I couldn't let go of shit.. I didn't enjoy playing my favorite video game (stardew valley) as much. I just started playing that again within like the last month and a half or so... My eating habits changed. I  would literally wear the same clothes for almost a week (I didn't have to leave much I had a very supportive partner).. I'd pull socks off and you could see the dust fly off. It's embarrassing to look back, but now I'm showering regularly. I take care of my teeth and im getting back to a healthy weight. (I gained weight). It really depends on you and your behavior.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ooujnw/ive_had_severe_depression_for_the_past_7_months/h65f4zm/"}
