Because human wants are unlimited. They more you get, the more you want. \nWhat you can do, is try appreciating what you already have, try finding happiness in little things. \nThere must be many people around you, who are living on bare minimums, still are happy. Watching such people can make you value things. Try engaging with your friends or family, laugh pretty often, that way you'll find happiness in human relationships. And you can grow this too with little efforts. Try donating if you can or have something to give, it feels good and helps you to value little things.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q5pvas/how_do_you_stay_happy_and_satisfied_with_what_you/hg7dkxs/"}
