Best on the island man. And don't miss out on the chocolate filled Malasadas. So good. Also we have an event called Eat the Street on the 27th if you are still here. Basically most of the food trucks on the island gather Ina giant parking lot on the island and there is usually a theme (chocolate, cheese, garlic) and it's amazing. Shoot me a message if you have any questions. :) I've lived here about three years and am still finding new things on the island ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2wlnyg/i_was_able_to_financially_comfortably_take_a/cosew6i/"}
