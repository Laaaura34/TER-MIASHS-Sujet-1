I'm a gay trans man, and while it makes me really happy to see people who support the LGBT+ community, it makes me even happier to witness people changing and becoming more open-minded. You remind me a lot of one of my best friends. He was raised in a similar environment, and before me, the only encounter he'd had with an LGBT+ person had been pretty negative. We met on a video game and hit it off about a year ago, and our differences haven't impacted our ability to be friends at all. He's one of the most thoughtful, compassionate people I've ever met, and had he not opened up to me about the way he used to look at things, and told me about what he'd been taught growing up, I'd never have been able to tell.\n\nThere are people who've been hurt by bigotry that may still be a little bit adverse to you, and I understand why they're wary, but I personally think it's really nice when people change and if someone who once hated me for who I am decides they no longer feel that way and would like to support me and people like me, I welcome that. I think it's important for people to grow and shift their perspectives, and they need to be given room to do that. You've given me a bit of hope today! Unlearning hatred that you didn't just choose, but were *taught* takes a lot of maturity.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/o1pjo2/i_was_raised_a_bigot_and_tonight_i_got_to_pay_for/h23wnpc/"}
