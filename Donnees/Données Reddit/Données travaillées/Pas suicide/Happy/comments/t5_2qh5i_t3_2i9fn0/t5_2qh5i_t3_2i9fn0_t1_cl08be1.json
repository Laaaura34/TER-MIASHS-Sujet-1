She was almost in a wheelchair last year, but now she's walking to the grocery store. We seem to be getting closer to an understanding of the disease, which is hopefully also moving us closer to a cure. In any case, best wishes, and keep that sunny attitude of yours! <3", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2i9fn0/in_the_past_year_i_have_was_robbed_at_gunpoint_my/cl08be1/"}
