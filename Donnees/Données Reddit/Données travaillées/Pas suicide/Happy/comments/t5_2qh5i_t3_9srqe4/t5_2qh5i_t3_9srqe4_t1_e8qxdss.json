School has been really hard to deal with, especially considering it is my last year so everyone is super stressed. However, today I got my predicted grades back (which is what I use when I apply to uni) and they were not only better than what I thought they would be, but they are also enough to apply to my first choice uni. I am over the moon! On top of which, I scored the highest in my year group on a chemistry test today, beating even the brightest of students. It really was one of the best days in recent weeks.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9srqe4/school_has_been_really_hard_but_getting_my/e8qxdss/"}
