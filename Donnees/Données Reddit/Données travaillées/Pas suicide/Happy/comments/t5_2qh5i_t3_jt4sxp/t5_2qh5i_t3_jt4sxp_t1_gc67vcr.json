I don\u2019t know why, but while I\u2019m super in favor of those around me taking meds to help with brain chemistry, I\u2019m always reluctant to accept that reality for myself. But after taking antidepressants for the last few months, I\u2019m so glad I did accept it.  It has made this year full of strife survivable and even helps me to find joy where I can.  Good luck at your appointment.  That\u2019s the first step ( which so often is the hardest). But know that you have a bunch of internet strangers in your corner, cheering you on (from at least 6 feet away with masks on, of course.)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jt4sxp/started_taking_antidepressants_in_the_midst_of/gc67vcr/"}
