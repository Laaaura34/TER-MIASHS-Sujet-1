It was something and that\u2019s all that mattered at that moment but it quickly turned into a very toxic environment with a lot of exploitation of the employees, I wasn\u2019t interested in pursuing full time with how they treated people. \n\nI had some money set aside and had some more money added to that from a death in my family and I was able to get a used vehicle. I spent a lot of my spare time putting in job applications, tons that I didn\u2019t want, some I did, just to get out of the environment that was making me so mentally and emotionally anguished. \n\nWith this particular job opportunity after putting in my application, I went to the store and bought something and introduced myself to the manager, he invited me to come back the next day and do an interview, the interview went really well and he called me the next week. I feel that showing my initiative and going into the store to introduce myself really made an impression during a time of all electronic applicants. \n\nMy advice is during the times where it feels like you\u2019re treading water and not getting anywhere to just keep swimming. (Cheesy I know) but there were a lot of times in the past couple months I was in some dark places and staying persistent is what got me to a new place. Job hopping can be so tiring but I\u2019m hoping now that I have something stable, full time, in an environment that\u2019s not so draining I may be able to think about a future career and online school. I wish the best of luck to anyone out there pursuing making something with themselves or just bettering their lives in whatever ways they need to.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mdfixp/i_got_the_job_i_really_wanted_and_start_monday_i/gsb4rnt/"}
