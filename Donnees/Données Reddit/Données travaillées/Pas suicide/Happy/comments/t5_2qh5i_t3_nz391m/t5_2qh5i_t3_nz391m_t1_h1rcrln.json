I'm 57m. Started taking it a year ago. It was a mental leap just to decide to take it but really glad I did. I had some life events that weren't catastrophic but certainly stressful. Only side effect: over time if you stop taking it you will experience a light-headedness. My wife and I are both taking it and experienced this. My doctor said it was one of the most common anti-depressants prescribed. Good luck.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nz391m/battling_depression_daily_today_im_winning/h1rcrln/"}
