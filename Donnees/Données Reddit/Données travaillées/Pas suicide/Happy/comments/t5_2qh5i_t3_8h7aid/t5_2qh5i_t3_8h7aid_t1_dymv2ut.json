It's been a struggle because clothes sizes run so much smaller in the Philippines. I'm a size 10-12 with a C-cup and GIRL it's so hard to find clothes (and gowns) that fit well. Being my size (in the Philippines) means having to ask for XL or 2XL (sometimes even 3XL) when we shop at local brands. Meanwhile, I have some clothes from overseas that are like women's medium or small. It's crazy!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8h7aid/two_weeks_into_shopping_for_gowns_for_my/dymv2ut/"}
