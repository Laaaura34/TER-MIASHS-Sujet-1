My dad was pretty much besides himself. We\u2019re both lucky that our parents we\u2019re always open about sex and sexuality so it wasn\u2019t an embarrassing subject for him to talk about in a family setting. His friends were also really supportive also. My dad ended up fighting with insurance to cover the implant for years. They tried to argue it wasn\u2019t medically necessary but he successfully argued it was medically necessary for his future mental health.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gj1xlf/yesterday_reddit_saved_my_brothers_balls/fqkv0gk/"}
