This happened a few years ago, my son was 7 and very shy, he told me (mom, dad is not in picture) he hurt down there. I had just read a story on Reddit about testicular torsion so I took him to urgent care immediately. They were amazed that I had caught it within less than an hour and they manually untwisted it and sent us for an ultrasound to make sure there was blood flow. Had I not read that story I\u2019m sure he would have lost one. I had no idea this was a thing.\n\nGreat job in helping your brother!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gj1xlf/yesterday_reddit_saved_my_brothers_balls/fqkytex/"}
