People are 50/50 really funny and nice or assholes with hate. I wouldn't say I tried suicide when I was younger but I definitely put myself in situations for self harm. One time it was really bad and then I snapped out of it and was so thankful I did. Life is so precious and I realize it the older I get. \n\nWell for me it was easy. I puked up my stomach lining (green/blue) from taking 5-6 hydrocodone a day on top of 18-24 Triple Cs. Which by the way FUCK up your organs so bad that once you stop doing them you can never do them again or you'll have organ failure. Luckily I only did them a short time. \n\nBut yes easy because i OD'd twice and thought I was having a heart attack the very last time. When you see death in the face, it makes you want to stop. And to clarify : stopped pills when I puked up stomachs lining and OD. Quit smoking weed when I thought I was dying.
