You\u2019ve both shown strength, courage, and commitment in weathering all the adversity. Your living situation carries so much weight in life...home needs to be that haven from the world and all its stresses, so having crappy housemates definitely takes a toll! Now that that situation is over, and you guys are moving in together, I think you\u2019ll begin to heal (ptsd can\u2019t be cured, but it can go into remission), and you\u2019ll begin to be able to enjoy many more happinesses in life. You deserve it! Congratulations!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/daw3ji/things_are_finally_getting_better_for_me_my/f1z7v29/"}
