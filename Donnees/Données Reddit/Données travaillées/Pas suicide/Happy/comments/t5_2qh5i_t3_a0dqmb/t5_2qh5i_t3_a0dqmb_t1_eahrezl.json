They were not phrased in a manner that implied the poster felt warm and fuzzy. \n\n\nIn the interests of common courtesy, if you do feel warm and fuzzy about a subject that many people find distressing or in fact any unrelated subject, it would be polite to make your own /r/happy post rather than bringing it into a thread where it will distress the majority. If you feel warm and fuzzy about death without underlying psych issues, go nuts and enjoy that feeling. Just appreciate that directing it towards others on a post they made, in an aggressive manner, will upset people who are enjoying *their* warm and fuzzy feeling. In the space they specifically set up or visited for it. And that's a fucking shitty thing to do. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a0dqmb/yesterday_i_sat_next_to_my_so_and_told_him_i_had/eahrezl/"}
