But the Buddhist in me wants to remind you that your happiness came from a sequence of your past virtuous actions, and this reality is by nature impermanent.  \n\n\nAll this happiness that you now have will shift, and nothing will stay the same. People that come together must part with tears, and all must be left behind at the time of death.  \n\n\nTo seek protection from the suffering of reality through impermanent phenomenon will only end in suffering.  \n\n\nLook within, and find the bliss that arises from non-attachment and non-rejection. Train your minds, with meditation to find the happiness that cannot be affected by impermanence. Then when you part ways and your circumstances change, you will not suffer.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a0dqmb/yesterday_i_sat_next_to_my_so_and_told_him_i_had/eahmq40/"}
