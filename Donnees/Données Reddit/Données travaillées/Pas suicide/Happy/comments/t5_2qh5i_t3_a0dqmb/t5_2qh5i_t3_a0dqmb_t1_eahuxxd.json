We are not perfect. We have bad days. I wasn\u2019t always this happy. My previous 4 year relationship was not nice. I suffered badly with loneliness and thought I would never be able to make friends. I hated school and I messed up my final exams, I was ill throughout my teenage years. We recently had some family health scares. Will has had his ups and downs too but those aren\u2019t my stories to tell. When people get older, they tend to say that they wish they lived in the moment more, and realised how happy they were. That\u2019s what I am doing with this post. Our parents and our dog won\u2019t live forever, perhaps we won\u2019t always have great jobs, but right now everything is gravy baby.
