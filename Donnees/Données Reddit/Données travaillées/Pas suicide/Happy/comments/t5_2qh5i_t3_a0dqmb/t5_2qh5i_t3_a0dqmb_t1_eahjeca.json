You seem to have reached the pinnacle of self actualization. Just know that your relationship will have its valleys and it\u2019s peaks, and ultimately life is what you make of it. \n\nTo everyone else: It\u2019s easy to look at others and think \u201cwhy am I not at this point?\u201d But we also must realize that there may be countless hours of anguish and heartbreak that both of these beautiful people may have endured before they reached this point, that we will never see. The negative of social media is that most of the time we don\u2019t broadcast our most difficult trials. And is that always so bad? What a miserable world we\u2019d live in if we all just moped around in our own self pity. \n\nTo some extent it is good that we see others at their best. It is good to compare ourselves to others to have something to aspire to. \u201cWhat do I need to do to have this kind of happiness?\u201d That is good. To those of us who seem to be going through the worst of life\u2019s trials, it is rewarding to see others enjoying the best that life has to offer. Because no one has a perfect life. Life is hard. It spares no one. But it gives us something to look forward to, a reason to continue on. A measuring stick, if you will. \n\nBe depressed, don\u2019t be content, but never feel like it can\u2019t get better or you can\u2019t achieve the life you dream for yourself.  Don\u2019t get bitter, get better. \n\nJust my two cents. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a0dqmb/yesterday_i_sat_next_to_my_so_and_told_him_i_had/eahjeca/"}
