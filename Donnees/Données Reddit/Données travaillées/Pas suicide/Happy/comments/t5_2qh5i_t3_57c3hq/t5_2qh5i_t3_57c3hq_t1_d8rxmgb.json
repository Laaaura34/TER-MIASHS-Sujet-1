In fact, he had a carburetor in pieces on the dining room in the early days of our marriage. He eventually got it back together, and the car it belonged to lived a long and productive life.\n\nThese days, his energy gets sapped from medical conditions and treatments; medication requires him to take a nap or two every afternoon, and he has lost the manual dexterity that he used to have. This year has been one long stream of hiring people to do various jobs around the house. We've had people keep the lawn trimmed for a long time, but hiring people to do routine jobs in the house has been a bit depressing. If you lived next door to us, we could keep you really busy! Good for you!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/57c3hq/i_made_an_elderly_neighbor_happy_this_morning/d8rxmgb/"}
