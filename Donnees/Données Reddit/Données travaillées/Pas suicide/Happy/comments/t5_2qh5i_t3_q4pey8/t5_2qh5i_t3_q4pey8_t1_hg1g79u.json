That\u2019s why I left, it\u2019s too crazy and easy to get lost over there. I appreciate your comment and don\u2019t take it wrongly. I\u2019ve been seeing a therapist and have been fully honest, also seeing a psychiatrist to help with my anxiety that followed me being sober. Had a lot of sleepless nights with strange thoughts but it helped being honest as they put me on a plan that has genuinely been helping.\n\nSo far so good. Can\u2019t say things don\u2019t cross my mind at times but seeing how much better my relationship with my family and with MYSELF most importantly has gotten is what keeps me going.\n\nBlessings to you and your journey as well.\n\nThank you.\n\nOh p.s: I got a puppy and he takes up a lot of my down time now haha", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q4pey8/3_months_clean_from_heroinpercocet_i_feel_amazing/hg1g79u/"}
