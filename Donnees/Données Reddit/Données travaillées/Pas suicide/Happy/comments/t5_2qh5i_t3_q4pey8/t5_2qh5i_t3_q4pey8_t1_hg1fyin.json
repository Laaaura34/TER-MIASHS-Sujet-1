South Florida is a rough place to attain sobriety; opiates are a plague down there.\n\nThat said, beware the \u201clocation based cure\u201d. Whatever it is in you that led you to use addictively to begin with isn\u2019t gone. While you have the benefit of sober clarity, take some time to examine your mental health and give yourself every possible tool to continue the battle against addiction. It lasts a lifetime.\n\nPlease don\u2019t think I\u2019m trying to rain on your parade. Three months is amazing and I don\u2019t want to take any of that away from you. I only offer the warning because I\u2019ve been there, and I\u2019ve known others who have been there, and the \u201clocation based cure\u201d is a very common tactic that has predictable pitfalls. Just want you to be aware of them so you can continue the beautiful journey that is sobriety.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q4pey8/3_months_clean_from_heroinpercocet_i_feel_amazing/hg1fyin/"}
