That's why it's taken me a while.  Your thoughts all seem valid but hard to put into practice in a natural way.  We do have meta-conversations where I address our behaviors with each other and our words.  But can you imagine what you would have said if your dad had asked you what you want to pursue in life when you were 12 or 13.  Perhaps you would have felt put on the spot.  Like you weren't prepared to answer and it was stressful to be asked.  And if I can't just ask him what he likes because I already know (spoiler alert: it's snowboarding).  \n\nI think the trick is to spot the naturally occurring opportunities to break past the mundane patterns of family life and find a way to say something that really reaches him and touches him.  I can't just do it when, or because, I want to.\n\nHe's withdrawn sometimes.  He spends hours in his room sometimes.  But I don't need or expect him to be perfect all the time.  I expect him to be good enough all the time and excellent every once in a while.  \n\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/6l94g1/my_wife_and_son/dk56q41/"}
