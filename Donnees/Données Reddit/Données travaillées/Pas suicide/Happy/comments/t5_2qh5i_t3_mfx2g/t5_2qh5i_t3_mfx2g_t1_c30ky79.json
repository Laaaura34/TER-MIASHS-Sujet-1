Everyone wants to blame ICF but ICF is only doing what they were directed to do by OCD-DRU.  As for Shaw they are another story.  What do you expect from a large monopoly that does not treat it employees fairly.  There is a different pay grade for white males who work with the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, a different one for black males (lower) and a different pay grade for female altogether.  It's an old boy network and unless you know someone at Shaw you can kiss getting hired good bye.  You are never based on your education, skills and ability but rather WHO you know.  It is very tragic that we as Louisianians have not been forthcoming.  When I go home (another state) we are known as Lousyana.  I was born here, taken away at a very early age.  I came back because I liked it here and was educated here, married here and have children who live here. I hope that we can be the great State I know we can be.
