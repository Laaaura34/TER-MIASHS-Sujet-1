When the pandemic started I was still able to keep working (which I am thankful for) but as circumstances changed, I needed to leave work and work full time as a PCA for a family member. I'll be honest, there were and sometimes are days when I am at my wit's end. To help mitigate stress I decided to start a podcast (after being on a friend's one) focusing on sharing people's writing and poetry. The main reason was that the hardest part of writing for me was the idea of my work being rejected. So I thought people could use a platform where their writing could be shared even anonymously without critique. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n4 months in and I could never have imagined the support and willingness of everyone! While yes it's not the biggest podcast, people continually listen, send in their writing, give me feedback and just make the podcast feel like a worthwhile endevour. The podcast is even currently pinned on r/OCPoetry! One of my favorite aspects of it is that some have shared writing based on more damaging parts of their lives, with the hope that it will comfort those who are listening. If this small project can do good beyond giving writers confidence, like providing comfort and reassurance to the audience that they are not alone, then this is a pure success in my eyes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, this has been one of the bright spots for this year and I plan to keep working at it. So thank you for everyone who has supported me during all of this!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mqa31d/despite_it_being_a_very_difficult_year_i_started/gueophs/"}
