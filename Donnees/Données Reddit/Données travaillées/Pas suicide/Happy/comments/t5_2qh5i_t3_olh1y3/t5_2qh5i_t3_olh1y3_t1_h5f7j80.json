You look amazing. Not to be too personal- but the doc that performed your top surgery was amazing. I am starting to do that research. My youngest is still a bit young for the surgery, but I figured I should know what we are in for. The scaring is what had me worried, and yours looks perfect! Yay! It is truly amazing the healing that my little one could do once they were open about their gender issues and we could work on them instead of keeping silent. I got my sarcastic, sassy, funny kid back. Seeing this brings me joy. I know the work will be worth it. \n\n(And to all the trans haters that show up to downvote us- a trans person\u2019s gender has literally nothing to do with yours. A trans person is no threat to you whatsoever. Just walk away. Leave them alone. Their life has no bearing on yours. There are real things to be upset about. The ocean is on fire and Canada is literally spontaneously combusting. These are real problems. Trans people aren\u2019t a problem at all.)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/olh1y3/im_an_evolution_in_motion_pictures_about_10_years/h5f7j80/"}
