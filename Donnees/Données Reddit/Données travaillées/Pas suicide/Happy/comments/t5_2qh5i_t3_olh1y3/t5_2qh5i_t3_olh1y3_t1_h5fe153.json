Once we started talking about what was really going on and got a therapist; I got my kid back. Supporting and loving them was a no brainer. I realized that everything I love about my kid has nothing to do with their gender. They are still the same (but much happier) person. I love that they are artistic, an amazing friend, funny, share my crude sense of humor- none of those things changed or are gender based. It is really strange to me that a parent would only love a child for their gender.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/olh1y3/im_an_evolution_in_motion_pictures_about_10_years/h5fe153/"}
