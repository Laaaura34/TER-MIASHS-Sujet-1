It is amazing how something as simple as exercise not only improves your physical health, but also your mental. I think its a great way to take more agency over your physical and mental health by challenging yourself and stepping out of your comfort zone. How I liken it for myself is if I can challenge myself by running a few miles in a day, then I can conquer any goal in my day because I already was willing to push the envelope. Keep up the great work!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/j9vyn0/i_went_on_a_175_mile_walk_and_then_a_6_mile_bike/g8mf1kw/"}
