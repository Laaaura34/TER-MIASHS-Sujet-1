[Whomst is not a real word](https://tsl.news/life-style7134/), and this crap about who for informal and whom for formal is... I don't know... whatever.\n\nThere's an easy trick for choosing who/whom: just turn your sentence into a question and answer it with he/him. He goes with who and him goes with whom (they both end in M).\n\nExample: Who/whom got a job interview? (S)he got a job interview. So the correct form to use is who = Who got a job interview? Lexi did and she nailed it so congratulations!\n\nP.S. if this is some of your practice work, you're well on your way to mastering this skill!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iwokf1/happy_that_i_have_a_job_where_i_get_to_spend_time/g63dasc/"}
