I have two pieces of advice for you!\n\nOn decorating: be conscientious about the wellbeing of your wrists and hands! A lot of cake decorators end up with carpal tunnel or hand/wrist pain, and it can happen a lot faster than you'd think. Take breaks, stretch out your fingers and wrists often, and if you start experiencing pain, seek out solutions sooner rather than later. Your long-term health is important!\n\nOn handwriting: your neatest words are the ones that are consistent in height all the way across. It might help if you draw lines on your practice boards before you start writing, like they do on kids' handwriting paper - [this kind of thing](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fe/93/1a/fe931a86bfb268a5f19465782c0a8397.png). That'll help you build the muscle memory for consistent text.\n\nGood luck in your decorating job, I hope you have a really great time with it!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iwokf1/happy_that_i_have_a_job_where_i_get_to_spend_time/g62htn4/"}
