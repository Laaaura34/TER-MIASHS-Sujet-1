It has nothing to do with being fancy. They are using a fake word from a meme. The actual correct word choice would be \"who\" in this sentence, not \"whom.\"\n\nFrom grammarly:\n\n>Whom\u00a0should be used to refer to the object of a verb or preposition. When in doubt, try this simple trick: If you can replace the word with \u201che\" or \"she,\u201d use\u00a0who. If you can replace it with \u201chim\u201d or \u201cher,\u201d use\u00a0whom.\n\nIf you apply the above, your sentence would be \"girl named Lexi, she applied....\" You wouldn't say, \"her applied....\" Therefore, it should be \"who.\"", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iwokf1/happy_that_i_have_a_job_where_i_get_to_spend_time/g63d3ir/"}
