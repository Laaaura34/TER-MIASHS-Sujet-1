Pay attention to filter cost too when you buy, some look super cheap but then the filter replacements cost almost as much as the system.\n\nAlso vacuum often, even the not-carpet, even the furniture.  Clean your vacuum filter often.\n\nFresh sheets on the guest bed and then keep the cat out of there before they come, or if you can, just keep the guest bedroom cat-free.\n\nI have had cats my whole life but I am also mildly allergic, these things keep me from sneezing.  Enjoy your feisty little guy!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ihe697/was_never_allowed_to_have_a_cat_because_everyone/g32e55t/"}
