Later this week I\u2019ll turn 42. Depression won\u2019t go away but it can be coped with and there will be times when it\u2019s not active. Fortunately I have people who love me for what I am and who won\u2019t let me down. I got a family and children through my partner whom I\u2019ve managed to bond with. Much more than I could have anticipated more than 20 years ago.\n\nMy only coping mechanism has been to keep my mind focused on something. The problem is that it gets me hooked to my phone and when being off the phone the bad thoughts come back. When being in the worst pit of depression the only thing that has helped is my friends dragging me to see some pigs and give them belly rubs. When thry oink happily I get at least some happiness.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/l1qkuk/i_turned_25_today_i_grapple_with_depression/gk2jafp/"}
