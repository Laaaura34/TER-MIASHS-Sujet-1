You should be proud, you made! You look amazing, love that green color!  You don't have to suffer alone, there is treatment for your suicidal thoughts and depression.  I know a lot of ppl don't have access to mental health care but if you have benefits at all or are unemployed due to COVID you may be able to access low/no cost online support.  \n\nIf you don't have any means for professional help, I found for negative thoughts/overwhelming sadness the book called Mind Over Mood which teaches you Cognititive Behavior Therapy. It really helped my husband and myself and it very affordable you should be able to find it online. \n\nYou are beautiful inside and out and very much worth sticking around for another 25 year, you've got this!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/l1qkuk/i_turned_25_today_i_grapple_with_depression/gk2dld3/"}
