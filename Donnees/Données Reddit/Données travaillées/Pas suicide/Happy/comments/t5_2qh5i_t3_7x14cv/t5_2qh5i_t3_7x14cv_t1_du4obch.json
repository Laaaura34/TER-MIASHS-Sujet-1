In the summer it easily gets over 100 degrees Fahrenheit and since I work outdoors it can become really frustrating.  I mean getting so hot that you are getting nauseous on a regular basis sucks. That being said, the luxury is we do not have to worry about snow days or getting stuck in bad weather. This past winter has been mostly sunshine and being in the mid 70s. For those with seasonal depression I can definitely see living somewhere like California could help though.
