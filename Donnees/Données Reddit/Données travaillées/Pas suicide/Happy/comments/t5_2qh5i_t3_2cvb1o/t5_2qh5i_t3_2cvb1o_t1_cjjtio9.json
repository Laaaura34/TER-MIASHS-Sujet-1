It is quite effective for children. They even sell special bikes for it. \n\nBut any bike can become a balance bike. Just remove the pedals, and lower the seat. You want the rider to comfortably rest their feet on the ground while sitting in the seat. \n\nThis is quite safe, and feels quite safe to the rider. Safety helmet is still a good idea. Now on a level paved surface the rider can push themselves around on the balance bike. \n\nThey will build up skill and confidence. They will begin to glide along with their feet held off the ground. All the skills accept pedaling will be developed without fear. \n\nAt some point the learner will ask to have the pedals added. Not too long after that, they will want the seat raised to a proper height.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2cvb1o/at_25_years_old_i_rode_a_bicycle_for_the_first/cjjtio9/"}
