I tried to learn as an uncoordinated, overweight, unathletic child, but I fell too many times and basically gave up.\n\nThankfully, I have a totally awesome and patient older brother who offered to help me get my bearings. After a nerve-wracking 10-15 minutes in an empty parking lot by his house, I was able to hold my own. We went out for a 7-mile ride on a trail near his place, which ended in me [falling over after a bee flew in my face](http://i.imgur.com/vfY13OO.jpg).\n\nThat was more than three years ago. Last summer, I completed [my first Century ride](http://i.imgur.com/2wBWZuL.jpg) (100 miles) around Lake Tahoe, and did it again this June. \n\nI never thought in a million years that I would ever learn how to ride, period, let alone turn into a distance cyclist :)\nAmazing what you can accomplish when you just believe you can do it :D", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2cvb1o/at_25_years_old_i_rode_a_bicycle_for_the_first/cjjo0me/"}
