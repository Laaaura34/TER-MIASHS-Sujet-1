Every journey is 100% different because everyone has a different reason for their infertility. I definitely recommend having a strong support system, try not to get discouraged and never give up even on the hardest days when you want to. Try to be open about your journey because you may find other people who you know who will open up to you about going through a similar situation. A good reproductive endocrinologist is key and fighting for answers even if it means getting a 2nd or 3rd or 4th opinion. If you smoke or drink, try to stop now. Start taking good care of your health and take your vitamins. Track your cycles, have blood work done, a hysterosonogram,etc. :) Big hugs and so much luck & love to you!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/98ok2m/10_yrs_of_infertilitytreatmentslossesim_now/e500p7s/"}
