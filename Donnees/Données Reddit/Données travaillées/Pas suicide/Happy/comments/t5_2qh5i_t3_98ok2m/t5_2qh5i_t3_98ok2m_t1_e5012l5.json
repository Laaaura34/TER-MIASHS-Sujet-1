I ended up having gastric bypass surgery and lost 175lbs which I hoped would help my fertility. When it didn't, we went to IUI treatments and then eventually exploratory surgery/tons of testing and IVF. Turns out I have lupus & antiphospholipid syndrome which was causing all of my losses & preventing me from carrying naturally. I found a great physician who listened to my concerns & put me on a great protocol of medication to keep me pregnant. This miracle baby girl is thanks to our 4th frozen embryo transfer in February! Never give up. Keep fighting for what you want and demand answers. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/98ok2m/10_yrs_of_infertilitytreatmentslossesim_now/e5012l5/"}
