Go talk to your urologist or OB/GYN. They will guide you in the right direction. I would say IVF is the last step in trying to have children. There are many other things you can do to to boost sperm count and make sure the uterus is a perfect home for that embryo.\n\nIf you want to talk or have any questions feel free to PM me. I would love to help you. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/88u9gy/after_trying_for_years_we_finally_got_to_meet_our/dwo4rpx/"}
