Knowing they feel safe and loved and you did that?! You let them know your love isn\u2019t conditional. I remember my then 15 year old daughter calling me and telling me she was pansexual (not going to lie, I had to google that lol). Hearing that sigh of relief, the tears, and laughter when I expressed that I really didn\u2019t care who she dated, her happiness was my only concern. O 8lb sweet baby Jesus, my heart. For the first time I felt like maybe I wasn\u2019t condemning her to a lifetime of therapy lol. She felt scared saying her truth, but she still trusted me with it. I love her no matter what. She will always be the best version of myself. The way cooler mini me. Today she is a fighter of bullies. She is so brave and fearless. I hope she always knows how much I admire and am in awe of her strength. When she got her first gf it just wasn\u2019t that big of a deal to me. It never will be. She\u2019s happy and healthy. Now THAT is a big deal.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/f7vvhv/my_16_year_old_daughter_went_on_her_first_date/fiii4qz/"}
