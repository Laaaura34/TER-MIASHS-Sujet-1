And you just took the most important step right there! Admitting you have to stop is HUGE. I still struggle, but just the awareness of knowing that drugs and I dont mix is a great deterrent most of the time. If you are willing, I reccomend NA or AA meetings. They seem stupid, but they have helped me a lot. \n\nJournaling, meditation, exercise, drawing, all of that stuff has helped me in my journey. And your friends are a big one too. If your friends all do that stuff, its safe to say you are or will be doing it as well. \n\nHit me up anytime man. Seriously. I know how hard it is to be addicted and feel alone in it. Ive been there thousands of times and each time i come out stronger. Dont you ever give up and dont you ever think that you cant do it. You are loved and appreciated by the people in your life even when it doesnt seem like it. Someone is always checking in whether you know it or not. \n\nMuch love to you fool, and again, hit me up if you need it! Im always here, even for a stranger who was once an asshole \u2764\u2764\u2764", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nurxwx/finally_starting_to_love_myself_this_is_a_genuine/h0zf1on/"}
