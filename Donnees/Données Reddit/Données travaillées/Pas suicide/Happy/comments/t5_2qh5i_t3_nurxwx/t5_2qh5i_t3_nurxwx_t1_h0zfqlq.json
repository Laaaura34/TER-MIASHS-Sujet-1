I wasted so much time on other teachings and his are the only ones I think anyone will need for anything in life. \n\nIts kind of far out there at first but its some legitimate stuff and thats coming from a pretty skeptical guy like myself. \n\nHis whole thing is \"consciousness is the only reality\", so, whatever is brought to awareness in consciousness must be expressed in your life. \n\nHave you ever just been thinking how shitty something is and it just gets shittier? Maybe its not just getting shittier, maybe your thoughts are having a direct impact on the events that take place in your life. \n\nWhethwr its real or not, it has helped me millions of times over. I have learned to keep that inner peace even when the outside is going to shit. This is because I know that my negative thinking has brought this stuff into my life, and positive thinking can make it go away. \n\nYour chouce whether or not its worth your time, but I promise you if you give it a shot and really try to stay open minded, youre life will do a complete 180 beforw your very eyes. \n\nMuch much love \u2764\u2764", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nurxwx/finally_starting_to_love_myself_this_is_a_genuine/h0zfqlq/"}
