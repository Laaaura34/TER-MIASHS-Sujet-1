Thanks for taking the time to write this up. One thing I have noted with psychedelics is that no matter how experienced you are with them, they can be quite unpredictable at times. I\u2019m glad that they indeed have helped you overall, and that it\u2019s definitely cool that it\u2019s the type of drug where it became evident to you that you were overdoing it and almost chasing an epiphany. When noted, you knew to stop for a bit and seem to be doing well and look so happy in this photo. You write some great accounts of your experiences. Reminds me of the bizarre and peculiar experiences I have had with psychedelics over the years. Have been on a hiatus because of work and an opioid addiction but plan to get my feet a little wet again to help me guide and influence myself a little more to make better decisions in life. Although, I know to not fully rely on the drug to fix me but rather find something inside me that allows me the clarity to promptly and willingly do so. Thanks for sharing and I wish you the best!\n\nEdit: I will PM you at some point to talk more. Thanks for inviting me to do so! :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nurxwx/finally_starting_to_love_myself_this_is_a_genuine/h13zrkw/"}
