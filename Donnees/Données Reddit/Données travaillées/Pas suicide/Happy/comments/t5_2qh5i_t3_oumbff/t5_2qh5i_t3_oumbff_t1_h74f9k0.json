Personal bests may not always be known, but pool records are usually displayed, so when someone breaks that, it's a big deal. \n\nThe philosophy is generally you're racing your past self, you're racing the clock; the other swimmers are there to do the same, but has the side effect of providing a secondary meter to try and beat. If you're ahead of the other swimmers, you're likely doing well compared to your personal best.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/oumbff/tatjana_schoenmakers_reaction_to_realizing_she/h74f9k0/"}
