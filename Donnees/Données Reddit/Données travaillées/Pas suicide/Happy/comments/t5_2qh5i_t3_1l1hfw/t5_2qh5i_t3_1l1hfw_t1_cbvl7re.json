We actually met on chat roulette when we were both bored at a friend's house during Christmas break. We talked for several hours and then added each other on Facebook and exchanged numbers. We hit it off really well and quickly became really close. We talked pretty much all day every day. Since we both live in Florida and he lived at the beach we met up there twice but only as friends. We never talked about being in a relationship when he didn't live here because he was two hours away and it just wasn't an option.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1l1hfw/decided_to_take_the_next_step_with_best_friend_of/cbvl7re/"}
