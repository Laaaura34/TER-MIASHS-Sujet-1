But, I do know that certain truths are evident across all time and societies.  \n\nWe could talk Emerson and his views on success, Lao Tzu and his views on depression/anxiety, Teddy Roosevelt or Adler and they all have similar messages.  Life is to be lived in the moment, do what you can with what you can, don't worry about the future or the past and following your own path. Do not worry about what others think etc. \n\nI am sure that I'm not the first person to have this revelation and that many people have in the past, I'm # what billion person that has existed in this world?  So in that aspect I do share some views with Taoism, I am nothing more than a drop of water in the vast ocean of the world.  \n\nWhatever brings you peace and happiness is something you decide for yourself, and I will not object to your view. Everything in this world is subjective after all.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lrgugk/i_finally_have_my_own_definition_of_happiness/goltth2/"}
