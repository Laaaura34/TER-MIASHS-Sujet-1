Thanks for calling me an idiot btw, that tells people more about you than me. The point of the post was to demonstrate a difficult life. Maybe in your situation your family will be fine but there are redditors who have experienced these things. There are times where I've had to ask my parents for money. The post was sarcastic to portray a parent who is remembering all the bad things that happened. People have a tendency to remember the worst in life and only dwell upon the good times when they have lost something. In this post it was their child leaving them after they had successfully raised them. \n\nYou are right by the way, I don't have children. I wrote this using my grandparent's reflections on life. They were put into a retirement home and my family would only really visit them on the holidays. Thankfully I got to talk to them a lot so I learned this from them. Despite the entirely pessimistic outlook they portrayed, they'd still end that story every single time with \"And I'd do it all again.\" \n\nParenting sucks, but it's the most rewarding experience, I think you as a parent should be able to see that. There are even plenty of parents on the comments of my post resonating with what I wrote. You would be the first to call me an idiot which I honestly find insulting rather than critical. So I'm gonna drop down to your level like we all do on Reddit and call you an idiot right back for not understanding something.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8qvilm/after_multiple_miscarriages_and_almost_giving_up/e0og8qx/"}
