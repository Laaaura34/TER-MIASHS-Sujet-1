I was thinking with the mindset of \"people always remember the negatives best.\" When you're divorcing your spouse, you remember all the bad times like when she dropped your phone in the pool, or when he spilled wine on your father's favorite shirt. It's only after they're gone that you start to think \"Gee but there were some fun times though.\"\n\nSo throughout most of the post I tried to make it seem super negative up until the end where the reader was supposed to get the idea \"Gee but that's a life well lived.\" \n\nLooking back on it now, I do kind of see how it was a bit too negative though. I'll keep your post in mind if I ever try to write something like this again.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8qvilm/after_multiple_miscarriages_and_almost_giving_up/e0mvlwk/"}
