My wife and I just found about a week ago that she had a miscarriage with our baby girl. She was 13 weeks pregnant and it was her first one. It has been one of the hardest things both of us have ever gone through and we are broken. \n\nYour post gives me hope and a bit of happiness. Cherish your baby every single day. Love your baby like you have never loved anything in your life. Hold your baby in your arms and tell your baby how much they mean to you each and every day. And make sure you take care of your wife as well. You're in for an amazing time and it will be hard, but remember that you have a tiny life that is fully dependent on you and needs you so much. \n\nCongratulations my dude. I wish you and your family the best. I hope that you never forget these days moving forward. \n\n-- a sad dad that's so happy for you!
