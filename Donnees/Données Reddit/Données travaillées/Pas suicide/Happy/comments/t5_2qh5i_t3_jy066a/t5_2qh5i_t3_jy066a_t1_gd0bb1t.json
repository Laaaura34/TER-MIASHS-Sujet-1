I\u2019d just... fade out. No filters, no fucks given... looking back I recognize it was all because I was just in so much pain... I just wanted everything to stop, and somehow I found a temporary \u201ccalm\u201d while drinking myself into a blur... when I woke up from it all and realized I needed to sober up for a day or two, it was back to my situational hell/reality, before falling back into it and fading back out again. I don\u2019t think I wanted to die, but I didn\u2019t really want to live the life I was living anymore. I didn\u2019t want to feel that way anymore. It took nearly falling over the edge for me to realize the only way for me to truly feel better was to get sober. I didn\u2019t know how long it would last... didn\u2019t think I\u2019d even get past a month... but I started to like the way it felt. Here I am, one year later. All I can really say is that it\u2019s worth it. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having a rough time and I really hope things get better for you. You\u2019re not alone :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jy066a/in_just_a_few_days_i_will_be_1_year_sober_no_its/gd0bb1t/"}
