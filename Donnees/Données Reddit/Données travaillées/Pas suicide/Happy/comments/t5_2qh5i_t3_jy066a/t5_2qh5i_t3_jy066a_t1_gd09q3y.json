I hope you feel proud of yourself as you should be.  I understand what you have been through as I have had my own struggles back in the day.  It's been many years since I became sober and my life just clicked into place.  I still have pressures and crappy days now and then but I can deal with it without getting drunk or high.  I'm positive you can continue your journey in sobriety and  if you are struggling reach out to the people that love you so they can give you the support you need before you do something silly and back slide.  \nBest of luck.. take care!  \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude03", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jy066a/in_just_a_few_days_i_will_be_1_year_sober_no_its/gd09q3y/"}
