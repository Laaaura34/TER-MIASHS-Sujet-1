They get medical degrees, they are doctors.\n\nI went to countless regular doctors for this. \nI\u2019ve been prescribed so many pills it was ridiculous. \nWhen my malnutrition was so bad I couldn\u2019t focus, they said \u201cmust be ADHD\u201d. here\u2019s Concerta, Effexor, Ritalin, not working, maybe the antidepressants will help, welbutrin, Paxil, Celexa. \nWhen they ran out of pills then came the excuses. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got IBS, it\u2019s in curable\u201d It also has every symptom between heartburn and stomach cancer, so ANYTHING can be called IBS.  \n\n\u201cCrones disease, incurable, stop eating what makes you feel sick.\u201d\n(There\u2019s a test for crones, they didn\u2019t bother to check)\n\nTime to give up and \u201cmanage the symptoms\u201d with anti-nausea pills, or heartburn pills, or when it hurts at night, here are sleeping pills. \n\nI accepted the vague terms of my fate for over a decade. Stopped going to doctors, because they all said it was hopeless. I dealt with pain you can\u2019t imagine from my intestines literally being dissolved by my body, then the stomach acid leaking out. \n\nThen I went to one single naturopathic doctor (with a masters degree just like every doctor) and she said\n\u201dsounds like you\u2019ve been allergic to a lot of things, for a long time. Let\u2019s get some blood tests for food allergies. First time in my life a doctor tried that. seriously, first time.  \nHey, what do ya know!!?!\nYou\u2019re allergic to EVERYTHING!!!\nYour stomach is a mess!!\nLet\u2019s FIX it. \n\nHere\u2019s a diet plan that cuts out the bad foods, and still gets you some nutrition. \n\nHere are the probiotics that you aren\u2019t producing anymore. \n\nHere\u2019s stomach acid in a pill because you don\u2019t have your own anymore. \n\nEventually everything healed, the blood tests improved, I gained weight, got some strength, people stopped trying to talk to me about my \u201canorexia\u201d \nDoctors stopped checking for heroin tracks. \n\nAll so some insufferable ass-hat online could reduce my life\u2019s experiences down to the assumption that I\u2019m such a hippie I don\u2019t believe in medicine. \n\nThanks for your input.
