I got out of college with <6k in student loans which I paid off as fast as possible (took less than a year), whereas my in-laws are in their mid 60s still have 100k+ left on theirs combined. There are a lot of things wrong with the system. I don't want to argue on whether college should be free or not, but I definitely think at the very least, we should be aware that giving 18 year olds an option to take a non-escapable loan for more money than they have seen in their life is not a great idea.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/d9bwj7/i_paid_off_my_student_loan_today_it_wasnt_always/f1jqqbs/"}
