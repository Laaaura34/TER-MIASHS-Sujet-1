That means you might have to relocate out of US for a few years after your job till it becomes a decent economy again.\n\nThis warning is needed because if your plans get upset you can get really depressed when you have a Masters but no job and have spent a good deal of money to get your degree.\n\nIf you're a bright student, though, you have no worries.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mgoeb/i_just_got_my_us_visa_approved/c31vnb4/"}
