I've recently been brainstorming what makes me happy about parenting and what just stresses me out... My kids are 5, 2, and 1, and the five year old, being a high energy and very athletic kid (and a September birthday, so only in pre-K a couple hours a day) has a few activities that she's really passionate about. I realized that always being on 100 trying to get all three kids ready to run all over town for this stuff was burning me out... But it's all pretty essential for meeting her in the middle (she loves this stuff and has so much potential). So I decided to do more unstructured play time with the kids, even if it meant being *even more active*... It's been life changing. There is just nothing more satisfying than toddling around a swampy park with your kids, everyone in rain coats, picking up leaves and stuff.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/qge131/spent_all_day_with_my_daughter_and_that_makes_me/hi7nan1/"}
