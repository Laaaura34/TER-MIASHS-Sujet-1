I have Telehealth appts with doctors and homeschool my children(one has cerebral pasly and I'm also immunocompromised so we don't send them in person) and we only leave the house when we need physical appts for their yearly shots or I need my MRIs or injections for my pain, for example. Not sure if this is OP's case but it's possible to not leave your home for quite some time due to everything being delivered and tele health appts now.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/qc3ljh/i_went_outside_for_the_first_time_in_2_years_i/hhgd75e/"}
