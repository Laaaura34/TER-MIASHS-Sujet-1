My best friend of 13 years recently got out of a bad marriage, but one that rewarded them with two beautiful children.

She\u2019s made me more courageous, spontaneous, and whole than I ever thought I could be.  Just wanted to share the kinds of things we do for each other.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cqb07z/so_blessed_to_find_this_kind_of_love_at_37_years/ewv0bcn/"}
