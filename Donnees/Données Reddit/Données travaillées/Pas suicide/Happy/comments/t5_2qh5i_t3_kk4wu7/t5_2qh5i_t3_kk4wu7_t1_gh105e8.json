From someone that makes a living with the same type of tools (although I'm a Makita guy now), Dewalt is a great brand of drill drivers, impact drivers, and circular saws, but trust me, you'll want to buy an extra battery (or 10!) and extra charger because you'll blow through having live batteries quick! \n\nBtw, the flashlight in that kit you bought, is AWESOME. I guarantee that it will become what he uses more than anything. Seeing this post really made my day better though!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/kk4wu7/this_is_my_favorite_gift_that_i_was_able_to_give/gh105e8/"}
