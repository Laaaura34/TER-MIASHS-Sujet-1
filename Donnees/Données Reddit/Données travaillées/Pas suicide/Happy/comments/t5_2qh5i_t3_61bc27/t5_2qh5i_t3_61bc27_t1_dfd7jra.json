He's a big dude and carried a bit of a gut so I (in part) played the cynic and thought he was full of shit (we hated each other when we first met). He invited me to the beach a few times and I finally relinquished.\n\nWent from the first ring to the second and was hooked. Enjoyed it so much that I tore my rotator cuff (over enthusiasm and poor form) and had to take some time to heal. Here's an [old video of him doing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfVeJhaMRsg). [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXeAj7rMrv0) (someone I met through my friend in the process) is teaching me flying rings. I largely \"think my way through\" and this has (more than anything) been a process of learning to let go and find my flow state (something that's immensely difficult for me).\n\nOn harder days, I would tell myself all I needed to do was swing my feet out of bed and put them on the floor... I just need to brush my teeth... I just need to eat breakfast... I just need to get out of the house. I would break down my day into achievable milestones and just inch my way forward. That ultimately attracted a few friends who suffer from mood disorders and we're fairly open with each other, sometimes just saying \"I'm feeling on the cusp of a depressive swing right now and am trying to find a way out\" is the thing that's needed to find the way out.\n\ntl;dr \u2014 take one step, you might not know where you're going but it'll at least be an interesting journey", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/61bc27/anxious_and_depressed_i_stumbled_into_aerial/dfd7jra/"}
