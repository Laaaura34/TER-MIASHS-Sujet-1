Where do you live? I think its insanely cool that you go diving! Id loooove to see all the stuff under the water. Ive never seen anything. Its tragic! There are a lot of types of wrasses... we have a couple in the aquariums. The problem is that they are aggressive and eat coral. I had a lion fish for a while.. it was super cool to feed. You take this long, clear stick and put a small dead fosh on it... then you make it swim around and the lionfish will attack it! So cool! But its dangerous to have because theyre venomous. Mine never attacked or stung me. It usually happens when ppl clean their aquariums or are being idiots with them. In the ocean, you can hunt them and go try to kill their population, but here in the US (midwest) we keep them as pets lol\n\n\nAnd yes, the thing that scares me is that i didnt see two human-sized dolphins 10ft from me! That is seriously r/thalassophobia \n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/95zt69/today_i_saw_the_ocean_for_the_first_time_30f/e4wgy5l/"}
