My family is from Mexico so I grew up going to the beaches there. But I was in northern california with a friend and she had never seen the ocean so we pulled over and ran out there barefoot on the sand. She was so transfixed and I convinced her to run into the ice cold water and to taste the saltiness. She cried and we took a lot of pictures for Snapchat and we searched for seashells. Honestly one of the coolest experiences in my life.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/95zt69/today_i_saw_the_ocean_for_the_first_time_30f/e3xpmzx/"}
