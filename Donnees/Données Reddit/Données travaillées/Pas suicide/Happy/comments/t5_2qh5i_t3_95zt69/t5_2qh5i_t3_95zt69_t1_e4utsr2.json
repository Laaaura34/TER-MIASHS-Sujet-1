Thank goodness they werent sharks i suppose. Although a shark bite would be a great story lol.\n\n\nAlso, i have like, 5 saltwater aquariums in my house. I have 3 roomies and we all are into saltwater... and corals. Buuut, the clown fish we have are bred in captivity. Most of the fish in the US are genetically modified anyways to make them prettier or more unique. Theres so many types of clown fish. My favorite is the snowflake clown, but i doubt that happens in nature!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/95zt69/today_i_saw_the_ocean_for_the_first_time_30f/e4utsr2/"}
