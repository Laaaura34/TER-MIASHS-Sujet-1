All kinds? Is lion fish also a type of wrasse? Sorry, I don\u2019t know much about fishes! I\u2019m going to learn more though. It\u2019s fun to know what you are looking at. The wrasse I mentioned is about the only fish I recognize in in the ocean here. I do recognize a couple of sharks as well, but you rarely ever see them here. Lion fish aren\u2019t dangerous though. It\u2019s only painful if you get attacked (perhaps it can be dangerous, but it rarely is).\n\nYeah, sometimes you can\u2019t see much. All of a sudden you\u2019ll turn around and see a large white shark right in front of your face!  Never seen one myself, but I\u2019ve seen a video where that happened (pretty sure it was a white shark).", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/95zt69/today_i_saw_the_ocean_for_the_first_time_30f/e4wob1f/"}
