I would never claim to know the exact feeling of devastation they feel when they have gone through IVF and been pregnant with the embryo they couldn't conceive naturally only to have it not suceed, but I have felt devastation. No human can implant themselves to the mind of another and experiences their experiences, but they don't need to.
