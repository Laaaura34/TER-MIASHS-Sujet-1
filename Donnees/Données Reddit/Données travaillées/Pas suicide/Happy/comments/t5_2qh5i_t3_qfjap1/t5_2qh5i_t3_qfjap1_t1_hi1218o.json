And every now and then someone would comment something along the lines up \u201cYou need to be a writer.\u201d \u201cYou should write a book.\u201d Etc. And every time someone did I would screenshot it, make a collage of the comments, print it, and put it right next or on my computer. And every time I doubted myself or thought no one would buy a book I wrote, I would look at that picture. Friends, family, and complete strangers supporting you is a hell of a motivator.
