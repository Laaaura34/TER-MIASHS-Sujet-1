So many of you I don\u2019t know have bought my book since I posted this and this love and support from total strangers is absolutely incredible. I don\u2019t think I could be any happier than as I am right now. I\u2019d show you a picture but I have tears in my eyes. \n\nIf you did buy the book, I would love a picture of you holding it or you holding your phone or kindle. You definitely don\u2019t have to, but I would love it! \n\nThank you to each and every one of you for your purchases, your kind words and uplifting motivation.
