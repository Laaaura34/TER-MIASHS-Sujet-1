Thank you for your kind words. I think it's only right that I return the favor.\n\nNow given everything that you've said, I first want to say that I sympathize with you completely and I understand how you feel. I've been there, but I'll tell you what, the difference in how these things play out is how well you respect yourself. Every girl wants a man who will respect her and honor her, but in order for a woman to find that she looks for a man who respects and honors himself. I'm not saying you do or you don't do these things, but what I am saying is not matter how shit turns out or how it may seem to be going you continue to work on yourself in all different aspects such appearance, knowledge, trades, skills.. just add to your self-worth by making yourself who you want to be and in the end all that matters really is how happy you are single or not. So don't fret because of something as trivial love.. although love may be a powerful feeling, so is happiness and with love comes happiness BUT also brings sadness and  turmoil. You cannot love without being willing and able to withstand heartbreak... so ask yourself questions that you can honestly answer. Am I ready for love? Do I truly love myself? If I do can I then love someone else? Will I be able to handle them maybe not loving me as much as I love them? The answers and solutions to these questions lie with you, my friend. Good luck with your journey and here's hoping that we'll all end up happy in the end. Cheers.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/33hhy6/id_just_like_to_share_how_much_i_love_her/cqmpd7e/"}
