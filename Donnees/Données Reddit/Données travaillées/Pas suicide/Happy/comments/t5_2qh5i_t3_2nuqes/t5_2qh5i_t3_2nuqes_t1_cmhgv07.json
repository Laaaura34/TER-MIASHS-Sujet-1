Less than 7 years later and that's over $30k. By the time I'm 30, I fully expect to have closer to $60k in my retirement account(s), all because I started contributing young.\n\nSeriously. Do it. You really won't notice - especially considering it'll coincide with a big raise - and you will thank the Internet for it for years to come!!!\n\nEDIT:\n\nI just did the math. You start now and contribute $65 pre-tax per paycheck to a 401k. You contribute for 45 years. You end up with $197k at age 65.\n\nConversely, you start 10 years from now. At age 65, you'll have contributed (personally) $15k less to your account over that decade, but you'll have 87k less in the account. (less than $120k)\n\nThis assumes 4% growth (which is honestly SUPER conservative). Make that a more realistic 7% and you find yourself at $477k after 45 years, or $230k after 35 years.\n\nYes, you read that right. By waiting 10 years, you lose $240,000 dollars.\n\nSuddenly, $65 pre-tax (~$50 hit to your take home) seems REALLy cheap, does it not?\n\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2nuqes/so_i_got_some_news/cmhgv07/"}
