Before I transitioned, I did not see a future. I couldn't picture or imagine myself reaching 30. I used to just walk thru life with blinders on. I felt nothing, wanted nothing, was nothing. Now, my life feels vibrant. I feel like I have something to fight for. Even on my worst of days, I want to get out of bed and tackle the world. \n\nWhen I was still in the closet and unaware of my true identity, I took the path of least resistence. I drowned myself in methods of escape: video games, drugs, sleep. Now, I have two degress. I work at a law firm. I have positive, successful interpersonal relationships. I'm not impuslive, I have control over my actions and reactions, I can feel emotions. It's night and day, what this transition has provided me. \n\nAs far as changes I didn't expect, I'd say cycling like a biological female was a big surprise. For some trans women, the introduction of bio-identical hormones can result in monthly cycles, similar to what you see in cisgender women. I never expected that, and I'm surprised my doctors never shared this with me.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/llyp7y/im_hesitant_to_post_this_outside_of_lgbt_specific/gnsyku5/"}
