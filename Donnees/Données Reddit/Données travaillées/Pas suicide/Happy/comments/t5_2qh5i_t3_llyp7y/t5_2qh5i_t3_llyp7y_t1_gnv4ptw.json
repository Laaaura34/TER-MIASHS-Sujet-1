Its a mini birth, life, death, rebirth that mimics the seasons. I wanted to relay this info to help you navigate the cycle because if you take advantage of moving with your internal seasons you'll be so productive and balanced. For example the start of the cycle is like spring it's a great time to get creative and lay foundations for projects, winter in the cycle is usually when a woman bleeds but you don't need to bleed to take advantage of this time in this season its about slowing down and giving yourself space silence and rest. Emotional and mental balance is what comes when you follow your internal seasons, I hope this is helpful in some way. Congratulations to you!!!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/llyp7y/im_hesitant_to_post_this_outside_of_lgbt_specific/gnv4ptw/"}
