Picking a new name is so difficult, because it very much has to capture your new identity. I spent a couple months trying new names on by having my friends call me those names and by writing them down a lot. I started with really feminine names \u2014 Olivia, Jessica, Marie \u2014 but nothing ever really fit. That is, until my friend recommended my name. It\u2019s ambiguous, but still feminine, and it comes up in pop culture only rarely.  I was on top of a mountain when he suggested it and it just... stuck. I love my name! I think like many other trans people, my new name just fell into my lap.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/llyp7y/im_hesitant_to_post_this_outside_of_lgbt_specific/gnt87g2/"}
