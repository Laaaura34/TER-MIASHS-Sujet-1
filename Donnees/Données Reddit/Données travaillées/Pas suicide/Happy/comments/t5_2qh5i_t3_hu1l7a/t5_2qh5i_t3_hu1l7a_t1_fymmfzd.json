It's an emotional sci-fi about time travel, and the dub is excellent. It's one of my favorites. \n\nI also watched an anime movie recently called whiskers about a girl who turns into a cat to get closer to her crush. Very cute. \n\nThe lost song is a series about magical songs and gets pretty existentially dark but I enjoyed it a lot. The soundtrack is lovely and it's very beautiful yet sad.\n\nHopefully you've yet to see at least one of these and you enjoy it!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/hu1l7a/im_finagled_my_way_into_working_four_consecutive/fymmfzd/"}
