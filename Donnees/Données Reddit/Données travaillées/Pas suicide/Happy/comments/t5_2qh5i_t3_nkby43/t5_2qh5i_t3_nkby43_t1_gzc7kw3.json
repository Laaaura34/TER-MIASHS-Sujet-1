I can\u2019t imagine the grief she\u2019s experienced and also the comfort in having someone new be there for her when all was lost. You\u2019ve given her so much but I also can see how much she\u2019s given you. You really did need her as much as she needed you. I wish you both so much love and happiness.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nkby43/on_this_day_a_year_ago_i_officially_became_a_dad/gzc7kw3/"}
