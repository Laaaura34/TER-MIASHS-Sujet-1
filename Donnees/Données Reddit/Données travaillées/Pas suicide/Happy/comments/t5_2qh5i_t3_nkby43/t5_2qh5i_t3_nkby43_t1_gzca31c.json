I was adopted myself by my kindergarten teacher. We never forget how you stepped up and chose us. You are a hero in my book. My parents are my best friends, I will be 30 this year and I don\u2019t think I will ever forget the day I was chosen. Again thank you.\n\nEdit: OP are you going to respond to these allegations or what? This would be pretty easy to prove if you are who you say you are.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nkby43/on_this_day_a_year_ago_i_officially_became_a_dad/gzca31c/"}
