[https://youtu.be/PIzvl7QsQHw](https://youtu.be/PIzvl7QsQHw)\n\nI go diving in search of an amazing deaf couple's GoPro, that ended up dropping in the lake a few weeks back. Then, while I was searching for the lost GoPro, Vanessa, who had her phone out so she could better communicate with us, accidentally dropped it off the side of her paddle board. We ended up using 2 tanks of air and were searching for over 3 hours in total for both their iPhone and their GoPro, but it the end, it was all worthwhile just to see their faces light up when I finally found them!! I also ended up finding an anchor and a super sweet old pair of Oakley's AND Ray Ban's! Such an incredible day and one of my favorite dives yet!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/hrur2w/i_went_diving_to_recover_a_deaf_couples_lost/fy6fu9g/"}
