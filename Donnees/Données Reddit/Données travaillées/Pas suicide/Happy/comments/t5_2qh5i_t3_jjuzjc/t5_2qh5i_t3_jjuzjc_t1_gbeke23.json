Thats the way I see it anyway. I mean, its the one thing you're assured of as a citizen of the US is the right to vote. Exercise it, take advantage of that right.

Look at Obams's time in office. Gotta vote in every election. Thank your wife for voting!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jjuzjc/i_am_34_years_old_and_just_voted_for_the_very/gbeke23/"}
