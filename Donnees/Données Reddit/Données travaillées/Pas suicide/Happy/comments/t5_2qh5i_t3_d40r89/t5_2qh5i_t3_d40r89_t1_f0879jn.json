This can be a problem behind bushes. \n\nDon\u2019t plant bushes too close to the house as the roots can destroy the foundation. Less is more. It\u2019s also less to care for. \n\nLearn to do handiwork early. There is a YouTube video for everything and none of it is particularly difficult. \n\nEZ House Wash is an AMAZING product. So is Clorox Cleanup (cleans even filthy gutters). Allowing your house to get dirty can ruin the surfaces. \n\nCrab grass is an annual. Plant seed in the fall when the ground is 60-65 degrees and pre-emergent in the spring and you\u2019ll have a beautiful lawn that needs far less work and less chemicals. \n\nGet quality products. They last longer and save money in the long run. That includes carpet, paint, shingles, and appliances. \n\nBe sure you have hurricane ties installed. They are easy to add. \n\nBe careful power washing. It can ruin concrete, siding, and wood really easily.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/d40r89/i_grew_up_in_a_trailer_park_and_my_mom_and_dad/f0879jn/"}
