By a man and woman who sexually assaulted me severely. Months in the hospital turned into years of solidarity and hate. But it took meeting my love that all of these traumas I\u2019ve once held, well, they are actually my gifts now. And I am so thankful. I have forgiven that man and woman but never will I forget the 30 some other girls they hurt too. But without that trauma, I wouldn\u2019t be the woman I am right now. And let me tell you something, I love her so so so much.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/fi8i06/my_boyfriend_once_told_me_it_takes_seven_years/fkfqb9i/"}
