I highly recommend the book \"the life-changing magic of tidying up\" not because tidying or being tidy is a moral imperative, but rather because that book has the least shaming and most empowering approach to tidying that I've ever encountered.  Tidy or not: the world likes you just the way you are. If it's something that bothers you then don't be ashamed that you're not good at it because it's a skill that is not taught very well. I am a horrible slob and it's taking me 30 years to figure out systems that work for me... Things get better and worse. I need to pick up all my wrapping paper clutter and my sewing projects.... But instead I'm just hanging out here on Reddit.\n\nSo glad to see that you're happy, friend.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/kj09y3/after_a_huge_and_slow_mental_recovery_i_finally/ggveo7c/"}
