It\u2019s so awesome when people figure out ways to provide their pets with enrichment. When I moved two years ago, my kitties and I ended up in a much smaller space so they were super bored. There wasn\u2019t a way for them to look outside which was one of their favorite things to do; so I bought some wood boards (about 6in wide), nailed pieces of plush carpet to them, and mounted them on the wall beneath the big windows. I also got two huge bird feeders. Their mood improved so much when they were able to perch by the windows and watch the birds.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pgwehg/didnt_realize_for_the_longest_time_that_my/hbee9xl/"}
