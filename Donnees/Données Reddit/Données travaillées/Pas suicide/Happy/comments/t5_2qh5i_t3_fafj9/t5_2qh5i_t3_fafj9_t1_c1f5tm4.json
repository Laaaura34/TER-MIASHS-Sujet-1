The doctors upped the medication a bit yesterday, as her blood pressure had risen slightly again. The CTGs are all looking very good, luckily. As are the echoscopies where they focus on the blood flow in the baby's brains and in the placenta and umbilical cord. It's just that the blood pressure will keep rising little by little and there's only so much that can be done about that. When it's time, it's time. And here's to hoping that time is still some weeks away. But it might also just be mere days. Man, it's just such an uncertain time.\n\nLuckily, though, my girlfriend doesn't have eclampsia yet, it's still pre-eclampsia. She's still kept on medium care, though. And she won't leave there until the baby has been delivered. It must have been a tough time for you and your partner, back then. Did you also have the HELLP syndrome then?", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/fafj9/i_could_use_some_happiness_right_now/c1f5tm4/"}
