Take some old tickets home from each shift and read them each night and practice cooking them in your head for five or ten minutes.  This will quickly get you up to speed mentally with the best cooks in the restaurant.  Also watch the ace cooks and find their best tricks and techniques and combine them all into your mental practice.  Also make sure that every single movement you make during the cooking process is quick and efficient. Try to get to where you're taking fewer and fewer steps each day until you're technique is as efficient as possible.  Always try to move quickly but precisely in all things.  This will make you an ace in no time!\n\nCongratulations!  I have a feeling you're going to knock this one out of the park.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/xal0c/after_putting_in_a_tremendous_effort_at_dish/c5ksabi/"}
