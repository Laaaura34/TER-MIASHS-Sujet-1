Sometimes I feel like it would take months to get the restaurant where it needs to be, but those aren't decisions for me. So instead I just try to clean as much as I possibly can before my manager's get mad for not finishing on time. I have at least 40% more responsibilities for cleaning then when I was taught, luckily I get faster over time. But the cleaning situation in that restaurant bothers me and needs to be addressed.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/xal0c/after_putting_in_a_tremendous_effort_at_dish/c5l1cjo/"}
