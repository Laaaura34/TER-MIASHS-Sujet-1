That's the best feeling, isn't it?  But do yourself a favor - and trust me on this - print out what you wrote on your post.  Put it in a drawer somewhere and later - when you fight, when he does something stupid, when you do something stupid, when your feelings get hurt, when you wonder what the hell is up - pull out that piece of paper. It will remind you of the things that make it worth it.  Always remember the friendship, the laughter, the reasons that THIS is the person you want to be with. I've been living with my guy for almost 20 years and as much as he still makes me laugh, there are times I reallly want to hit him with a frying pan. And then I remember the day we became a \"we\" and get over it.  Good luck :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2q2rob/my_boyfriend_moved_in_this_weekend/cn2wpzn/"}
