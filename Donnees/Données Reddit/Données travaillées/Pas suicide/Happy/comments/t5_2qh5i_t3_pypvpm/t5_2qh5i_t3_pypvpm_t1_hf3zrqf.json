I would look up a calorie calculator to get a rough estimate of how much you burn in a day. You can then base you meals off of that. I burn about 2500 per day on average so I eat about 2000. I started very low because I wanted the weight off fast but it was not the healthy way to do it (1000 calories a day for like 4 months). I do work out regularly but I started out just playing beat saber to get moving.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pypvpm/lost_150lbs_got_a_new_pup_got_married_and_hiked/hf3zrqf/"}
