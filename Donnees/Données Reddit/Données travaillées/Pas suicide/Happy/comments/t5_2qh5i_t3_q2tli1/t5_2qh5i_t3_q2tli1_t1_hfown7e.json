She willingly gave them up and we had a great year with them before there grandma pressured mom to get them back.....tbey went because they thought mom was going to get better and live with them too. She never did, but since we did not get legal custody when we had the chance, there is nothing we can do (we tried family court and even cps).\n We are slowly watching the kids turn into different people as a result of the trauma.\n It kills.\n I am so happy for you and you son, you two are both glowing!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q2tli1/i_got_full_custody_of_my_son_seven_years_ago_and/hfown7e/"}
