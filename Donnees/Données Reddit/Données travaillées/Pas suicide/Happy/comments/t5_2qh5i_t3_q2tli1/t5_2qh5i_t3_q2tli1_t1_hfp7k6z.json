I wouldve been better off had he not been there. I spent most of my teens/20s never wanting kids because I figured hey my old man sucked and so did his so why pass that along. But then the girl I had been with for a decade got pregnant and we had a baby girl whos 5 now going to kindergarten. Its the best thing that ever happened to me and it happens again every single day. Weve got a small place and are saving up to hopefully buy a house or ya know die in the climate wars. All Dads have different abilities, some can fix things, build things, play sports and do plenty of other useful things.
