I tell him I love something about him every time I see him. Last night I said he was the  sweetest because I always appreciate when he makes sure I\u2019m tucked into the blankets and if I\u2019m not he\u2019ll tuck me right in ~ he\u2019s got an adorable nose and I tell him all the time. My mind is all over the place lately but he\u2019s helping me pick up the pieces and I only hope I\u2019m doing the same for him.
