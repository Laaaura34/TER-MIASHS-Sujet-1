Talk to each other with the utmost respect ( meaning don't raise your voice at each other nor belittle or mock each other.) Talk when something is bothering you and work it out\n\nIt's you and him vs the problem \n\nIt's not you vs him as the problem watches on\n\nKind loving gestures works wonders. Compliment him \nAcknowledge the things he does for you and tell him you appreciate the things he does \nTell him you love his laugh. His eyes etc\nWhen he says self depreciating things about himself tell him otherwise\n\nHelp each other in improving themselves \nThat means reading self help books to overcome your insecurities \nBeing positive \nSharing things from r/wholesomemes with each other \nSharing self help videos on YouTube with each other \n\nImproving on yourself is the best things you can do to improve your relationship.\n\nI wish the best OP \n\nI wish you get your success in every endeavor \n\nI wish you power through every problem and every bad day \n\nGood luck \n\nStay happy, healthy and wise\n\nCheers :)\n\n\n\n \n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/aawqdo/finally_have_my_first_boyfriend_at_18_and_hes/ecvr5q3/"}
