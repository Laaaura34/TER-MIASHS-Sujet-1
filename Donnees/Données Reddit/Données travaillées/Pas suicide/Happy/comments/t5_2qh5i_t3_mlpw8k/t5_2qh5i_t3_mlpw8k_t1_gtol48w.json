It\u2019s an all day thing, but it\u2019s an absolutely gorgeous & easy hike (360 degree views of SF, the bay, the bridges) and part of the charm is the ferry ride to/from. You can buy some lunch (and beer, if you drink) at the market, and there\u2019s picnic tables at the peak.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mlpw8k/my_wife_and_i_finally_got_to_go_on_our_honeymoon/gtol48w/"}
