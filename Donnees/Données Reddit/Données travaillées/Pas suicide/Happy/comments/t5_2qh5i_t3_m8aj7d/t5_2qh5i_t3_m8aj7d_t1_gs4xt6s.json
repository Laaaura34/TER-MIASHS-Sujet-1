I.E. - maybe more runs are accessible by more lifts? So you\u2019re not just stuck going down a certain 2-3 runs when you can crossover to other parts of the area. \n\nAlmost like a \u201cdive bar\u201d vs the popular bar in town - both are fun, you won\u2019t have a bad time at either, but when you tell people you went to the dive (A-Basin) you get more respect from others who have gone because they know it\u2019s a gem. The East Wall at A-Basin was worth the entire time/money spent there. My father passed away last year and I spread some of his remains there because I was blown away with the view. \n\nBut that\u2019s the opinion of someone who\u2019s been to both places once so take that with a grain of salt. Hope you get to enjoy both kind stranger!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/m8aj7d/first_time_getting_to_snowboard_with_my_brother/gs4xt6s/"}
