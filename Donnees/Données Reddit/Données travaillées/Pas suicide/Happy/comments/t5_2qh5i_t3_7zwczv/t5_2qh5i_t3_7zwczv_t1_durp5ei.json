I used to work for a relatively small surveying&engineering company (about 30 of us) and so a big part of what my managers would look for is someone who is interesting and fun to work with.

It's good to have a balance on your CV :)\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7zwczv/20_years_ago_i_dreamed_of_traveling_the_world_but/durp5ei/"}
