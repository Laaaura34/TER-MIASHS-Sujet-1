Was a awesome little device. His had an IR blaster in it. When we\u2019d be working away in the country he\u2019d use it to change channels on the TV in the front bar of the pub. Top fella. Cool watches. Enjoy it dude!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/huzzjo/after_years_and_years_of_change_and_lifes/fyr1sd6/"}
