I\u2019m Aussie mate. Bloke is much more prevalent here, I didn\u2019t hear people use dude nearly at all when I was a young fella. It\u2019s definitely something more common now, especially cos it\u2019s kinda one of those more gender neutral greetings. I\u2019ve never heard my dad or any of his mates use dude for example. Most of them are tradies though and they seem to have a whole little sub-lexicon no matter where you\u2019re from.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/huzzjo/after_years_and_years_of_change_and_lifes/fyr4huw/"}
