What great opportunities ahead of you! \n\nMy son is high functioning autistic. His special education teachers were sooo amazing! His high school special ed teacher helped him go from barely even talking to his teachers to having a lot of friends and even making a speech at graduation ceremony! But his grade school teacher was also awesome and he loved her. \n\nYou're going to do such great things by helping young people do great things. You should be very proud of yourself!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cp6nlv/a_year_ago_i_was_told_by_this_math_teacher_to_not/ewprd6y/"}
