My dad and grandpa have made it every year as long as I can remember, but it probably isn't original. Pretty straight forward, but delicious!\n\n * [Pretzels](http://www.cdkitchen.com/recipes/recs/352/Aunt_Annies_Soft_Pretzels13849.shtml) - Just got it online, but they turned out good!

I had to get just the right balance of stickiness to roll the dough. This was accomplished by having a bowl of water and a bag of flour nearby. If it was sticking too much, I spread some flour on the counter. If it wasn't sticking enough, I dipped my hands in *a bit* of water.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/es3bt/i_had_one_of_my_best_christmases_this_year/c1ah6s8/"}
