Thank you so much. Well I did go through a lot of beauty box items and ended liking any kind of gentle cleanser like it cosmetics or fresh soy face cleanser. They came in boxes and they are really big so it\u2019s going to take me a while to go through them. I use a silicone face scrubber from Amazon for light exfoliation. That might be one of the biggest secrets honestly, exfoliation. Then, lots and lots of moisturizer. I have finally settled on kiehls ultra facial cream. And then I\u2019m also a big fan of micellar water in the afternoon/evening after getting all sweaty during the day and to remove make up if I wear it that day. Recently I went on Mercari and purchased something that came over the summer, 111 skins vitamin C skin brightening booster. I swear that stuff makes you glow. But I just re-purchased it and I\u2019m going to keep bathing my face in it until I look reborn again. I hope you found all that helpful LOL basically I have way too many samples and subscriptions so I canceled all them and I\u2019m going through it all now. It\u2019s probably a combination of all of the things I\u2019ve tried that has worked out for me nicely haha.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/eka2lr/2019_was_incredibly_rough_but_im_feeling_really/fdaneil/"}
