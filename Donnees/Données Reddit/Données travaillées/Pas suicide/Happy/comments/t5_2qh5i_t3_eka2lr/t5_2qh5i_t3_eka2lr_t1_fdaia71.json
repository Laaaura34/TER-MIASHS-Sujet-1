So many injuries that were preventable with true management from above, instead of leaving teachers floundering in their classrooms. I think I was like the 10th person to resign this year and I know they are going to be more. It\u2019s absolutely horrible that the kids will still be there but I had to go through the whole process of letting go of the guilt of leaving.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/eka2lr/2019_was_incredibly_rough_but_im_feeling_really/fdaia71/"}
