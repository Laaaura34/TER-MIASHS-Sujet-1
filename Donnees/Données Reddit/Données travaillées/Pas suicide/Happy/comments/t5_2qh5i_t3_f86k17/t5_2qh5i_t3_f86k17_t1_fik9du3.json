You are adorable and that smile says it all! In another post you mentioned you hated being a girl because you felt targeted by cat callers and pedophiles. As you start living and presenting as a guy, pay attention to if you feel like you are being truer to yourself, or if it\u2019s more like you just feel safer. \nEither way, your teen years are the exact right time to start finding out who you are. So good luck with the transition and I wish you all the best!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/f86k17/recently_realized_that_im_transa_guy_so_this_week/fik9du3/"}
