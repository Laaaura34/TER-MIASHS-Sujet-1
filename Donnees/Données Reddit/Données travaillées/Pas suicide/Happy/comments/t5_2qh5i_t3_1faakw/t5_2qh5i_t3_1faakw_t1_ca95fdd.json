So far as I'm aware, the 4.2 KA Event was caused not by human activity, but rather by cyclical changes in the orbital positioning of the Earth around the Sun, which are called [Milankovitch Cycles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles).   Several archaeologists have proposed that a mega-drought at that time was responsible for the mass abandonment of cities across Upper Mesopotamia (what's now northern Syria and southeastern Turkey.)  So what I'm trying to do is establish whether there is in fact any real evidence of a change in rainfall levels at a city in what is now Turkey during the period of the proposed mega-drought, to see if the collapse of that particular polity might have been related to climate change or not.\n\nThanks for your interest, by the way, and for your questions -- it's always nice to see that what I'm studying piques the curiosity of someone other than just me!  :)  \n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1faakw/i_just_found_out_ive_been_awarded_a_4000_grant_to/ca95fdd/"}
