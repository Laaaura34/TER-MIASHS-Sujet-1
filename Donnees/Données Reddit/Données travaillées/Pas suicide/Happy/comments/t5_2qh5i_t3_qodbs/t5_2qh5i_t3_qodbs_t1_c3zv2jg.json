Do yourself a favor and commit the following to memory.  Learn what an ETF is (I use SPY), set up a ROTH IRA, and open an account with ETrade. ETrade is more than willing to teach you how to trade since that is where they make their money. Its not that hard and financial advisors take a big cut.  If you have a 401k, put at least some money in bonds, more so as you age. Last, but not least, do not rent forever, but don't buy when you aren't ready to settle down in one place for at least five years, and do NOT get an adjustable rate loan ever. Last, but not least, if you have self-control use credit cards for everything, but don't buy things you can't afford, and pay them off every month. The rewards add up, and people who only pay with cash are essentially paying for my rewards. I use a card with travel rewards (AAdvantage), but there are cards that will give as much as 5% for gas, 3% for food, etc. those end up being big numbers when you consider the compounding of that money over the years. \n\nGood luck!
