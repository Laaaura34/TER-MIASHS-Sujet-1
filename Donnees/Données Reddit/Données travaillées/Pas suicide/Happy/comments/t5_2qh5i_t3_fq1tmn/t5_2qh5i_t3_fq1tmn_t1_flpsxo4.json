I\u2019ve been getting into it more lately since one of my friends is a legit makeup artist with almost 12k followers and sponsorships and that and she\u2019s always encouraging me to try out new things. It\u2019s super fun to do, and hilarious on the rare occasion I do go somewhere wearing it (mainly doing my laundry in my dorm mid makeup, occasionally the dining hall)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/fq1tmn/back_when_i_first_started_wearing_makeup_it_was/flpsxo4/"}
