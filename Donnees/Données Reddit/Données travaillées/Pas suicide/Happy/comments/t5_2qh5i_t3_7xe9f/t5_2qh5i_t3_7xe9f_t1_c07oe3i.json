However, she is one of the few GOPpers who supports gay rights. Now, do you suppose this is because she is so open-minded or could it be that in addition to Miami-Dade county her district also includes Key West and she knows damn well that without a good percentage of the gay vote she couldn't win an election for dog catcher? My point is that it doesn't matter whether they are Republican or conservative, some people will pander to anyone to get elected.\n\nI hope I haven't angered you with my oversimplification, but that's just the way I see it.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7xe9f/hold_on_a_second_republican_governor_of_utah_utah/c07oe3i/"}
