Younger children should definitely not have breakable vases of flowers on their tables (and not with exposed power cables running through the room if those flowers are real and there\u2019s water in the vases). Older children will definitely need better lumbar support. It\u2019s a bit confusing to me, unless it\u2019s just a temporary space for the first lesson or something, to help kids relax.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cxca4y/after_spending_all_summer_redesigning_my/eyl1tkp/"}
