From what I've read, depression and ADHD are often seen together, so you may have both, or just one, but with symptoms of the other.\n\nIf you aren't able to get to a doctor, there are some online quizzes you could take to see if you have ADHD symptoms. But of course, just remember, do NOT diagnose yourself based on an online quiz. You can use it to learn more about yourself, but at the end of the day it needs to be a doctor who diagnoses you.\n\nAlso, if you are female (which I am), it might be useful to know that it is typically harder to diagnose in women/girls, which is why many girls don't get diagnosed until adulthood. So if you are female and you feel like you would've been diagnosed sooner if you *do* have ADHD, just remember that that isn't necessarily true. I hope you find some answers soon!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwyf9s7/"}
