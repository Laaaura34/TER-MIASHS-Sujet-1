Also props to you for being a pre-K teacher, that job is so important!! Good for you for finding a coping strategy that works for you.\n\nThank you so much for the encouragement! Even though it would've been nice to have these meds while I was still in school, I am still very early in my career, so I plan to make use of my newfound motivation to try and advance as much as I can in my field.\n\nYou are so so kind <3 thank you very much for chatting with me. You can feel free to pm me at any time as well!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwym0dm/"}
