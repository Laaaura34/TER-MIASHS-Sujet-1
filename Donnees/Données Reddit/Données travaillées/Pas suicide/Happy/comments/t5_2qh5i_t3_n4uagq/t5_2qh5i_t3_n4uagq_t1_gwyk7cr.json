That must be really hard.\n\nThis whole experience has really made me realize how the world/society is set up so in most areas, only one personality type can be considered \"successful.\" School, for example, is set up so everyone is taught the same way. If you don't learn well with the given set-up, well, \"sucks to suck\" they say. \"You must not be very smart. Be careful, if you aren't smart you aren't successful.\" Frankly, I think that's a load of BS. Just because society says \"successful\" looks like a certain template, it doesn't mean you aren't smart or successful.\n\nNow of course, that doesn't mean life isn't hard with ADHD. I cant even imagine the self-doubt you had before being diagnosed. I also can't imagine how hard things were for you. I'm so sorry. I just wanted to remind you that you have *never* been stupid. And I bet you are very strong. I hope things are getting better for you now.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwyk7cr/"}
