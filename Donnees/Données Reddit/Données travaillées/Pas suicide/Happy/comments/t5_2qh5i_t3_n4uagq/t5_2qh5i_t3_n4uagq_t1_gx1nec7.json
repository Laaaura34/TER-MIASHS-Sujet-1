Thank you.\n\nHaving lived most of my life with undiagnosed, clinically significant ADHD I've developed some other mental health issues as well - primarily anxiety. It makes sense to me now. I was always anxious because my efforts too often collapsed (eventually) due to my inattention. It made for a very anxious life.\n\nThe thing is: I didn't know I was overly anxious. You only have your own brain and experiences, so how do you ever know that you aren't normal. Everyone is anxious, but how do you know if you are *too* anxious?\n\nI really envy you. You have your life ahead of you in full. I'm still lucky in that I was ever diagnosed. I'm sure there are 80 year olds out there without a diagnosis.\n\nThe one thing I will caution you on (hopefully it isn't applicable). When I first started my medication it was immediately awesome. I tell people it was like someone lowered the difficulty level on the video-game of life I play. Instead of playing Dark Souls I was playing Mario Kart.\n\nDon't expect that easy-mode life as the new normal. It has rarely been as good as when I first started on the meds. That said, it has been much better across the board. I'm very grateful for what I have. It comes and goes.\n\nAnyways. All the best to you. I hope you live-the-shit out of your new life.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gx1nec7/"}
