I felt there was something off, and I felt strongly about making sure they were OK if they inherited it. I had no clue it was ADHD.\n\nI'm grateful to live in Canada, so most of the costs of therapy are covered. This allowed me to sit with a psyhologist for over a year, at least once a month, and for her to really dig in and analyze my thinking.\n\nMy psychologists \"ah-ha\" moment came after I did a clinically administered IQ test. It was 2 hours long with just me and a psychologist in a room. I answered questions, arranged blocks, remembered long strings of numbers, etc.\n\nThe IQ test measured 5 \"aspects\" of intelligence. The 2 I remember are verbal comprehension, and working memory. My psychologist saw that my working memory was \"2 tiers\" lower than my verbal comprehension (I may have the technical terms wrong, but you get the idea). From there more testing, etc, but that was the break through.\n\nI hope you figure it out. Staying motivated to find out why you aren't motivated is a shit-show. If you haven't already, try to find a doctor/clinic that specializes in ADHD. They are more likely to have the full-range of tools to get you the help you need. Even if it means spending some cash, it is an investment in yourself that will change your life. I highly recommend.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gx1phvl/"}
