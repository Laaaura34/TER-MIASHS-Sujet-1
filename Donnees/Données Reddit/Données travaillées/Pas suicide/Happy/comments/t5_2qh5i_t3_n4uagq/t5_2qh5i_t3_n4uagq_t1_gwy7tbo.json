I thought I would never be successful.  I knew I was smart, but since I couldn't remember shit when I needed to recall it, I was the \"space cadet,\" the \"airhead,\" etc.  It always came to me 20 minutes later.  \n\nWhen you said, \"Maybe I'm not stupid, after all,\" I cried.  \n\nYou are not stupid.  You think different. \n\nAnd that's OKAY.\n\nI take meds too and 20 mins after I took my first dose, my day lined up in my head like a schedule on notebook paper.  All I could think was, \"If this is the way the rest of the world thinks, it's no wonder I've been a shit show.\"\n\nYou are smart.\n\nThank you for posting.  Someone you don't know and probably never will meet is incredibly happy for you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwy7tbo/"}
