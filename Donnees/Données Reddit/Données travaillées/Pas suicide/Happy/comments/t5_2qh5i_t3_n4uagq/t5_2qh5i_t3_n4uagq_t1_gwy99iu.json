I've always suffered from anxiety and lack of focus/motivation, but it took me way too long to realize. I spoke with my doctor and we tried anti anxiety drugs at first, and while that helped a bit, it didn't help enough to warrant continue taking. It was then that I started looking into depression and ADHD and was surprised to find that ADHD has similar symptoms.\n\nI went to a party this weekend (we're all vaccinated) and for the first time I can remember I was maintaining eye contact and actually listening to people rather than looking around being distracted by everything. My anxiety was also lessened and I was way more outgoing due to that. Tasks are easier to get done in one sitting. So far so good.\n\nI'd suggest speaking with your doctor about all options. They'll give you tests for anxiety, depression and ADHD and go from there. But visiting and being honest with your health care provider is the most important part.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwy99iu/"}
