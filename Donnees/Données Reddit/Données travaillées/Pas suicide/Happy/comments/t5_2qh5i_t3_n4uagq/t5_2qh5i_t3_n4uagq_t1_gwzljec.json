It took me 26 years to finally get checked out, but I've now been happily medicated for 15+. To say it changed everything would be a massive understatement.\n\nJust don't get carried away :)\n\nMake sure you sleep, make sure you eat and make sure you're not grinding your teeth and/or biting your tongue/cheeks at night. If any of that goes to the contrary, actively work with your doc to dial-in the dosage.\n\nIt can be wonderful, life-changing stuff, but the trick now is to get it to mundane, daily-routine status.\n\nWelcome to the other side, my friend...I'm truly happy for you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwzljec/"}
