I got lucky since the first medication I tried works wonders, but just remember not to be too discouraged if you don't get the diagnosis/medication you were hoping for. \n\nI have physical health problems as well, and it took me around 8-9 years and 8 different specialists to *finally* be diagnosed with something, and even still, the medications for my illness don't work for me :( \n\nBut I am not saying that to discourage you. I am saying that as a reminder to *always* keep fighting for yourself. Even if it means finding a new doctor, and then another one...and another one. You deserve to feel better!! I really really hope your appointment goes well and you start to feel better. You deserve it.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwyj3gy/"}
