I was diagnosed with ADHD and depression last month, and I'm 23. I'm currently trying to find a doctor covered by my insurance to prescribe medication. I've been unemployed since the start of the pandemic, which has really taken a toll on me. There hasn't been a single day where I didn't feel broken, lazy, or straight up unintelligent. I've felt so trapped in my own body that I began doubting that pursuing medication would be helpful, but this post is exactly what I needed to be reminded of. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I've become so accustomed to struggling that my brain can't even cope with the notion of it getting easier. It's almost overwhelming to think about.
