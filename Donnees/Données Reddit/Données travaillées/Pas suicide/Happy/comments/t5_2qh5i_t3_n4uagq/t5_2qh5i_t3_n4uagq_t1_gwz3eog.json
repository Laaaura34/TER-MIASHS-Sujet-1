Just because we dont have the same symptoms doesn't mean you dont have ADHD! Also, just remember you dont need a diagnosis to try non-medication coping strategies! (which you can find online)\n\nI'm sorry to hear you're having a hard time :( Try talking to your regular doctor, or to a psychiatrist. Best of luck! I hope things get better!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwz3eog/"}
