It can be hard adapting to the culture in the western world. I still struggle with understanding why people do things a certain way or understanding how people in the west eat, talk, act, etc. I\u2019m not unaware but it\u2019s hard to keep up. I\u2019d recommend you read up on western culture a bit through YouTube videos or online articles. I can try to help too if you need any help adapting to it all, although I can\u2019t make any promises. The west is very different from where we\u2019re from but both regions have their own pros and cons.\n\nHave a safe trip to Canada! I hope you settle in nicely and enjoy a comfortable life being who you are and not having to hide all the time. I\u2019d like to someday move to Canada but it\u2019s doubtful from where I live. I saw you said you have a masters and work experience qualifications. I\u2019m really proud of you and cheering you on! Best of luck!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pkdxb2/i_got_cerf_level_c2_highest_in_my_english_test_im/hc5jg3c/"}
