I hope this is the beginning of a wonderful new life for you. I am also in the process of immigrating to Canada. It is possible to complete the paperwork on your own - I have so far and many friends have as well. It's just double checking all the paperwork is properly filled in and you are patient with the current delays. There's lots of info help groups here and on FB. Wishing you all the best!!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pkdxb2/i_got_cerf_level_c2_highest_in_my_english_test_im/hc5kinc/"}
