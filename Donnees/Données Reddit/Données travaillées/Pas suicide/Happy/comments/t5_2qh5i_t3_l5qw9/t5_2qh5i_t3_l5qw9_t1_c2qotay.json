I think of \"the good things\" as being anything that makes me smile, laugh, love, feel warm, or feel safe. This list is not extensive but I'm sure you get the idea.\n\nHappiness is forgiving myself for making my share of mistakes, learning from them and then letting myself move on (don't dwell!). This gives me the time and energy to hold on to things that make my happy instead--like when someone says they love me, or when I have a chance to do something to help a friend.\n\nOf course, things still get to me and I'm not always happy, but that's ok too. It's all about embracing your feelings enough to hold on to good ones and let go of the bad.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/l5qw9/what_does_happiness_mean_to_you/c2qotay/"}
