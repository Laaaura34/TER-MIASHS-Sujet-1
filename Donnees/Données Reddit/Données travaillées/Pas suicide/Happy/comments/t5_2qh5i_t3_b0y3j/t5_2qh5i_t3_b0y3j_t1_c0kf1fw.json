He was picked up by the pound and was going to be put down but a rescue organization got him and I got him from them.  Then I had him for about 4 months and he got out through an open fence door and got hit by a car and still ran/walked about 6 miles away until some good samaritan picked him up and looked on the tags and called me up. \n\n$$$ later, he was fixed up almost as good as new.  He still tries to run away every chance he gets, but he also is a great watch dog, loves to cuddle and is uber happy everytime I come home.  If only people showed as much affection as dogs, this world would be a better place.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/b0y3j/my_fucking_grandma_died_today/c0kf1fw/"}
