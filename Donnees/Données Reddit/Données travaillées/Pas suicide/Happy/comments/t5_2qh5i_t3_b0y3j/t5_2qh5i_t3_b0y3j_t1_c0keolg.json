One drank and smoked herself to death by 60, I'd met her once when I was 2.  The other was a mean russian/german immigrant who while raising my dad wouldn't let the neighbor kid over to play, cause his name sounded \"Jewy\"... So, yeah, cookies and apple pie and awesome grandma's weren't in my life plan.  \r\n\r\nSorry you lost yours, but I'm soo glad you had a great one.
