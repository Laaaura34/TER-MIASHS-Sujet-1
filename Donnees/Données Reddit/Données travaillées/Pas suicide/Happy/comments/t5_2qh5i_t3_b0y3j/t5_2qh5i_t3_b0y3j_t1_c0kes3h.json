I was sad to see her go, but she was so fragile and probably so miserable at the end (though it was hard to tell because she handled it pretty gracefully), that it was easy to accept.  The same was true of my grandfather.\n\nI think the best part of having had great grandparents now is that I can look back on my memories of them and continue to learn from what they were trying to tell me then, but I was too young to understand.  In some ways, they've never left me.  I hope you feel the same going forward as it is a gift.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/b0y3j/my_fucking_grandma_died_today/c0kes3h/"}
