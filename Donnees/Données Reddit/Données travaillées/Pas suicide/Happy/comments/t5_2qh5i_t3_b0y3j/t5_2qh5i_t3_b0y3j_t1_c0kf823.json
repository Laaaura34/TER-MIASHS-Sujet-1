Now my Grandfather on my mother's side, he was just a great man.  Not in the sense of finance or adventure, just as being a man.  Always happy, pleasant and smiling, you couldn't go anywhere without someone recognizing him and coming over to say hello.  I'm just glad that my son got to know him before he passed away.  It's my goal as a parent to raise my son to be like him.  \n\nI guess the point I'm making is that it's people like your grandmother and my grandfather that put hope into the world.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/b0y3j/my_fucking_grandma_died_today/c0kf823/"}
