She was a great person too.  \n\nThe hardest thing at her funeral was watching my grandpa.  He'd been with her for 65 years.  65 years.  Think about that.  \n\nI've previously gone through a divorce and it took me a long time to get over that.  I was with her for 8 years.  65 years.  8 years.  My loss pales in comparison to his.  \n\nAt any rate, I'm sorry you lost your grandma.  If she was in pain, she is no more.
