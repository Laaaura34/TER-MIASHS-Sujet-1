She was the most supportive, loving woman i have ever known. You said that there are angels that walk among us and that your grandmother was one of them...i could say the same about mine. I lost my grandmother(mothers mom) and my grandfather (dads father) within the same week in february 2008. The most painful thing to go through in my life thus far. However, they both taught me so much that i can't help but smile when i think about them. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/b0y3j/my_fucking_grandma_died_today/c0keynz/"}
