DBT has changed my life though. The key points for me are mindfulness, radical acceptance and Dear Man, Give, Fast. Message me if you'd like more details. \nAs for the self harm I still get urges but I've learnt how to deal with those urges in more healthy way - ice diving, distraction, self sooth, 54321, Stop skill, pros and cons, radical acceptance, willingness (again message me for more detail). \nSelf harm has been the hardest thing for me to give up but everytime I do it I label it as a lapse instead of a relapse and I've told myself and others I can't and won't promise that I will never do it again. After every lapse I take one day at a time. I always take myself to hospital even though I hate this because it teaches me the consequences of my actions. When I fight the urge to self harm I put a pound in a ceramic money box. When either the money box is full or I reach a milestone with quitting I smash open the money box and treat myself to something pretty as a reward for doing so well. It's also great to count the coins to see how many times I've resisted doing it and have coped in another way instead. When the urges come I tell myself 'even though this is hard I've gotten through it before so I can do it again. I will try my hardest not to so if I end up doing it I know it was my very last resort so I can forgive myself.'", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/88phzb/after_5_years_of_dialectical_behaviour_therapy/dwnxfr2/"}
