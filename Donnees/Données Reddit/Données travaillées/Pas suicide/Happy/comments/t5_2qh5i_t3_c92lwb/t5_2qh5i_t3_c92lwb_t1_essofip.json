I'm 29 years old, and my father is on dialysis due to his drinking. We don't know how much time he has left with us. He turned down a kidney transplant that went his way because he was too scared to go through with the operation. Please remember this if you are ever tempted to drink again. What we are going through is something other families should never have to go through. My dad didn't drink every day -he would drink once a week on the weekends. But whatever he did to himself that one day a week was enough. Monitor your alcohol intake, people. It's all fun and games until it's not.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/c92lwb/my_39th_bday_yesterday_my_son_is_45_i_quit/essofip/"}
