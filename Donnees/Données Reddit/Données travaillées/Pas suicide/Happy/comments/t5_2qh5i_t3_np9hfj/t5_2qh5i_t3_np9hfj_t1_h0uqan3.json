I've been in a very bad mental state for almost a year now, but every now and then I see something beautiful in the nature, hear some heart touching notes in a song or look at someone I care about make progress in their lives, it all just lifts my spirit back and helps me to keep going through every new day. \n\nLife can be so beautiful when we choose to see it that way, it can also be completely pathetic if we allow others to ruin it for us. I'm trying to learn to love myself and move past the events that traumatised me, and man the day I succeed at that will be the day I'll take full advantage of my good mental-health to make this world a more loveable place for everyone who deserves it.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/np9hfj/exactly_two_years_ago_today_i_tried_to_take_my/h0uqan3/"}
