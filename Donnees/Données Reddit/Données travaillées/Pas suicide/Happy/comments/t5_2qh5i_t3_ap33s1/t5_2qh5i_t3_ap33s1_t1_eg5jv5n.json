I had a really rough few months of illness and I had enough time between throwing up and fainting in the restaurant to open that amazing gift (the restaurant was great, they moved us to some lounges outside where it was cooler and looked after us great).\n\nThat ticket turned things around for me. I'd had to shave my head because I didn't have the energy to care for it, I bearly got out of bed and I didn't look forward to much, but then I had this amazing thing to look forward to. I started looking after myself better and worked towards the goal of actually being able to attend my favourite band.\n\nFrom the top of the stadium, my sister and I sat and sung and yelled along to every song and it's one of my all time favourite memories. I keep that ticket in my purse at all times just to remember that there will always be something to work towards.
