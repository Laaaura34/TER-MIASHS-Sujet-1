I hadn't noticed her.\n\nI wanted to add that flash mobs have their roots in the [happenings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happening) of the 50s and 60s, which took on a variety of forms, but were usually things like small performances done spontaneously among crowds, random, on-the-street poetry readings, painting sessions, etc. Someone would just start \"doing art\" of some kind, and crowds would gather. It wasn't really like buskers or street performers, in that it wasn't about collecting money, but more about bringing art to the people, and often promoting some political agenda.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iak8f/i_believe_this_is_the_original_flash_dance_i/c229hlq/"}
