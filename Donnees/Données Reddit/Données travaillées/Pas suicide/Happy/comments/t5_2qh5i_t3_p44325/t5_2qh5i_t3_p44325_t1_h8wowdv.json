And it was hard. She ended up a single mom by your age with no education. We both faced so much judgement and exclusion just because of her age. We would get labelled with stories they've heard about teenage mother's while ignoring the reality they were seeing of a young, happy, thriving family. I remember moving a lot, but I was kid, everything is just normal. I got used to change. And I was always loved.  I've been able to have so much time with my grandmother. My mother has now been a friend for as long as I was a child. In a high school where the parents bullied me more than the students, I earned validictorian. She did everything for me and I was the first in my family to go to college and beyond. She's not even close to retirement age and I can start planning on taking care of her. I've also had the luxury of waiting to have kids of my own with less fear that my mom won't be around to see it (or help, mainly the helping part). Take care of your girl, take care of yourself, and screw the rest. Another thing I got to learn at an early age was even if 1000 people are telling you something and seem so sure, they can all be wrong.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p44325/im_17_with_a_baby_and_i_have_to_say_i_am_so/h8wowdv/"}
