You have such an profound impact on people's lives. Even if you don't think you do, there will always be that one student out there that credits you with their success. Even something small like a positive comment on a grade can make all the difference in a student's experience. As for me, I will keep pushing and trying as hard as I can to keep doing well. This little comment on a short essay meant more than y'all could know.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/f8y2z9/ive_always_had_a_hard_time_with_school_even/fio8lpa/"}
