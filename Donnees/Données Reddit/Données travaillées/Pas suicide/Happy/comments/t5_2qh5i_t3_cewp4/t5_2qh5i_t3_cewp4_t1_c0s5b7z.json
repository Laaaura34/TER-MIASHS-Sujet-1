We had three hula hoops (two smaller sized) hanging from tree branches on either side of a field as the goals, with \"Keepers\" guarding them.  Most people were the \"Chasers.\"  They were trying to get a playground ball (Quaffle) into the hoops.  The \"Beaters\" had these soft balls they could throw at people and if they hit them they had to drop the ball they were holding and freeze for like 3 seconds.  The Snitch was a gold-painted rock that was hidden somewhere on the field and one \"Seeker\" on each team was in charge of finding it during the game.  Everyone had baseball bats as their brooms and they had to be \"riding\" them at all times or what they were doing didn't count (a goal would be disqualified or whatever).  It worked really well.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cewp4/ever_imagined_400_kids_pretending_to_be_at/c0s5b7z/"}
