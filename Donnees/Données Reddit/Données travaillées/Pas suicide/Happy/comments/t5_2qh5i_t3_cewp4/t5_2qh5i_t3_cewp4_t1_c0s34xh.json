It was definitely the best theme day ever.\n\nSuggestions from my summer camp:\n\n- care of magical creatures: everybody makes a monster sock puppet.\n\n- potions class: scavenger hunt for \"ingredients\" (fake eyeballs, rubber rats, etc)\n\n- quidditch practice: run around on sticks playing quidditch on the ground\n\n- feast in the great hall: set up the mess hall with the long benches/ tables oriented like in the films, have fancy centerpieces and serve things like fried chicken and cranberry sauce and other \"feast-y\" foods.\n\n- wand making: let every camper find their own stick in the woods, and then use glitter glue, streamers, sequins and paint to make magic wands.\n\n\nGood luck! Glad you guys are doing the same thing. It's an awesome treat for the campers :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cewp4/ever_imagined_400_kids_pretending_to_be_at/c0s34xh/"}
