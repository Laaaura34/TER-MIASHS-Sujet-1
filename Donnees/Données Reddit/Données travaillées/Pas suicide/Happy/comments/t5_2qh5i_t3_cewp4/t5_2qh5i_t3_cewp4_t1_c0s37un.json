The effect, when imagination and proper incantation is used, is the casting of a \"spell\". Those who get hit are out.\n\nPaintball paint is easy to wash off, cheap, and color coordinated. The only thing left is the \"wands\", which can be hand-crafted by the players for extra fun. Craft stores sell the cardboard batons quite cheaply. \n\nThe alternative is to roll up construction paper, which can offer the same effect.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cewp4/ever_imagined_400_kids_pretending_to_be_at/c0s37un/"}
