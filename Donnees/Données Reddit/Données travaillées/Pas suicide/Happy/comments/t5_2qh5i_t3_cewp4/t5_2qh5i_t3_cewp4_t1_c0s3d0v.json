I'm very pleased to here that another summer camp is doing this :) It's such a fun idea!\n\nOh, I did just think of another one.\nMy camp was a sleepaway camp, though this might work for a day camp as well (I'm not sure what kind of camp yours is):\nNone of us knew it was going to be Harry Potter day; it was a complete surprise. It was thus awesome to wake up and go to the messhall for breakfast and walk through the doors to see huge banners proclaiming which table area was for which house. We were placed in a huge line and as we walked through the entrance, a counselor placed a witch hat on our heads and whispered a house name in our ear, sorting hat style. Definitely added to the experience :)\n\nNot sure how well that would work with 400+ kids though (my camp was more like 80-100 kids), so you might need multiple lines and multiple sorting hats, but I'm sure it would be just as fun.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cewp4/ever_imagined_400_kids_pretending_to_be_at/c0s3d0v/"}
