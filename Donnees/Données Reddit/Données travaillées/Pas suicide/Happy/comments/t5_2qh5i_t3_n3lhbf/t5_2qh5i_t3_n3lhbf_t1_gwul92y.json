Any opioid and no idea how many mg of me talking because I\u2019d just pour 3-6 pills in my hand at a time then take two 2mg Xanax bars. Sometimes more than that even. I\u2019d not remember phone calls I made, texts I sent, appointments I\u2019d made. I\u2019d tell my husband \u201chey look a new episode is on! Let\u2019s watch it!\u201d And he\u2019d be like \u201cyou\u2019ve said that three times and I\u2019ve told you three times that we\u2019ve already watched it..\u201d he\u2019d get so frustrated with shit like that. I completely ruined two holiday seasons that I don\u2019t even remember. Completely embarrassed him and myself in front of family. I was a total train wreck.. gained so much weight, stopped taking care of our beautiful new home, like, I literally cared about nothing else. \n\nThe worst part was me realizing the pain of feel not taking the meds was actually withdrawal pain and not pain associated with my autoimmune disorder like I had originally thought. So my husband literally took all my meds and hid them from me long enough for me to sober up enough to be able to hear him and actually take in that I indeed have a huge problem. And still it took me about a year to believe him and start to take action for myself. My drug abuse never got as bad as it did after he first talked to me but I was afraid for a long time that I couldn\u2019t live a good quality of life without them. But that\u2019s addiction for ya. You lie to yourself without even knowing it or realizing it. But once I saw and felt just how physically dependent my body was on these meds it scared the shit out of me. I thought that because my meds came from doctors that it was okay. WRONG!!!!! And so now I\u2019m on a list so no matter where I go, all pharmacies know not to fill narcotics for me.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n3lhbf/the_first_photo_is_me_off_benzos_and_opioids_for/gwul92y/"}
