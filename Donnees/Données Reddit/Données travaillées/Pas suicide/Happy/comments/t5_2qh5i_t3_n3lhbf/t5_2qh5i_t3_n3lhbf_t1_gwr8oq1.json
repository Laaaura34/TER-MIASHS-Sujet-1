Those demons are that addiction voice in your head that overpower your sober voice or your voice of reason ya know? The addiction voice gets so loud sometimes it\u2019s like it doesn\u2019t let ANY other thoughts come in. So to combat that addiction voice you can do a couple things. One is you can start to physically verbalize things that you\u2019re sober voice would say \u201cyou don\u2019t need that, you don\u2019t want that, this cravings will pass, fuck that voice, etc.\u201d or what I did was write it down so I could easily read it and made it a mantra of sorts. I also printed out those shitty pictures of me and looked at them often as a reminder of the shell of a person I\u2019d become. Soon that addiction voice started to get quieter and quieter as my voice of reason started to get stronger and louder. Now I rarely hear that addiction voice. \n\nAA wasn\u2019t for me, NA wasn\u2019t for me, I do individual counseling, take drug tests for my husband if he gets suspicious(had to gain that trust back) started meditating again, eating healthier, got back into hobbies I love, got a part time job, being active, reconnecting with friends(the worst thing for an addict is boredom so change is necessary. Not necessarily scary but it will be different.) The journey is different for everyone though. Be kind to yourself and find support. You can do it!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n3lhbf/the_first_photo_is_me_off_benzos_and_opioids_for/gwr8oq1/"}
