The only way to regain those support networks and pride in yourself is ready its a secret LOL 1 min, 1 hour, 1 day don't forget the past but don't worry about it. I helped a buddy get clean from Coke. His dealer could get to him in 8 minutes so we made the 8 minute rule. If he could get past the craving for 8 minutes you knew he'd be ok..... point being is you look amazing and what we do to ourselves is pathetic and we never think we look that bad. I wish you the best but never tackle it as cured. Think of Philip Seymour Hoffman (an acedemy award winning actor). 17 years clean of heroin, 1 time back and he ODed. I love the happiness that comes thru your post. Keep up the good work just remember to quit everyday when you wake up, just gotta quit for that day.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n3lhbf/the_first_photo_is_me_off_benzos_and_opioids_for/gwtrcvt/"}
