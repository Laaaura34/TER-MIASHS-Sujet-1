Because this lame autoimmune disease I got in the prime of my life (I\u2019m talking 25 years old, 5\u20198, I was 135lbs, toned, I NEVER thought I\u2019d be someone who\u2019d lose their healthy just overnight like I did) which causes me to go into syncope/seizure at times so soon I became afraid of everything. So I just stayed at home and took medications all day every day. But this year I learned how to shoot a gun (got my own 380) learned how to snowboard, got a part time job (never thought I\u2019d be able to work again). So I\u2019m taking charge of my life again with the help and support of my husband of course and it feels good to be proud of myself again and even more so, have him be proud of me!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n3lhbf/the_first_photo_is_me_off_benzos_and_opioids_for/gwti8tg/"}
