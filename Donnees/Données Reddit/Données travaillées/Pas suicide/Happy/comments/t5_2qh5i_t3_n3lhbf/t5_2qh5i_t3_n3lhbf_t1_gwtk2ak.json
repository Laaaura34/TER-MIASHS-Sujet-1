Chronic pain/chronic illness is fucking exhausting some days and I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to tell you that.. Since stopping the drugs and discovering better coping mechanisms as well as not letting that voice in my head tell me not to do things because staying home is the safe choice. Which is true but I also missed so much during that time. I\u2019m so happy to be getting my life back little bits at a time. And ya know what, I went into syncope (passed out) while taking my step son to get a hair cut and while also at the MVD but the world didn\u2019t end, an ambulance came, checked me out, I ended up being ok and if that\u2019s the worst that will happen I can live with that. As long as I take care of my body those episodes happen very few and far between now. So you keep going too! I\u2019ve found strangers to be some of the nicest people when I show them my medical bracelet and tell them I need help. Humanity in general can be just as beautifully amazing as it can be disgusting.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n3lhbf/the_first_photo_is_me_off_benzos_and_opioids_for/gwtk2ak/"}
