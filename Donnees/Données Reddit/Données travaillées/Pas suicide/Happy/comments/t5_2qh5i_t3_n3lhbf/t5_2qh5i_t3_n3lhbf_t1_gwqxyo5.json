Used to take 10mg a day with a LOT of alcohol. My girlfriend loves crystals, if y'all sell them online put a link up or a DM and a referral if you want so we can give you some compliments!

I've been on a nonstop pink cloud, found the love of my life, and have never had better relationships with my real and sober friends and family.
