Thanks for sharing your story. I wasn't sure how I was going to get gifts for Christmas. About 10 days ago an opportunity came up and without thinking I took it. I have been working 11 pm to 7 am on the graveyard shift since. Get paid on the 20th just in time for Christmas.\nI can now buy gifts and cook a Turkey for Christmas.
