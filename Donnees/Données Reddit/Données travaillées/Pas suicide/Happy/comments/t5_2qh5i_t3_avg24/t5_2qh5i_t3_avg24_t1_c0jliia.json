Today I got a job at a hedge fund working as the Chief of Staff's assistant. My mother's friend works for a professional staffing agency and asked her if she knew anyone that was good with computers, spoke Spanish and was interested in finance. I fit the description pretty much perfectly. The STARTING SALARY for the position is $87K. I keep thinking something is going to go horribly wrong because it seems almost too good to be true.\n\nHere's the kicker... in May, I'm graduating with a BACHELOR OF MUSIC!!! Suck it bio majors!!!\n\n:))))))", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/avg24/so_incredibly_happy_that_i_had_to_make_a_novelty/c0jliia/"}
