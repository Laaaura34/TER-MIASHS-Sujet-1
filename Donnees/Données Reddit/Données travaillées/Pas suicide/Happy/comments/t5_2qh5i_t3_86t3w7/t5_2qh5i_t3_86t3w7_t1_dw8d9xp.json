It sounds like you\u2019ve done well for you and her since then. Even though it may not seem like it to you.\n\nI think what you\u2019ll come to find is that because of your strength, your determination and your obvious love for her, this girl will grow up to be a magnificent woman. Don\u2019t doubt that, it shows in you now, and she will feed on it as she grows.\n\nIt\u2019s rare to see where someone \u2018gets it from\u2019, but I think in her case it\u2019s clear. You\u2019ve kept your promise to her and to yourself. That doesn\u2019t happen much anymore, you should be proud.\n\nGood luck to you both in the future. Not that you\u2019ll need it.
