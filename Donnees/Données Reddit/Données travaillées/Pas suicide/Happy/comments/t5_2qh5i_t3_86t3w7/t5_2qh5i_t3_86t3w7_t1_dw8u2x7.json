Started doing cocaine and quickly became an alcoholic, as well. He would leave and be gone for weeks. I tried being understanding and willing to do what it took to help him and be there for him. \n\nI'm 45 and he is 41. We have three adult sons and he was an excellent father to them. He's just not the same person.  He went from being a six figure earner to us having nothing. I have to move and have no job, no car because the motor died and with no money or credit,  can't buy one.\n\nWe have a 4 yr old and I'm just sad for her because I've decided to divorce her dad; she adores him. But he constantly breaks her heart. He leaves on business trips and doesn't call her, at all. When he's around he's ok, but when he's not home,  it's as if her and I don't exist.  \n\nI hope my story helps others know,  that they're not alone in their struggles. And thank you so much for sharing details of your situation - I needed this in my life!!\n\nI hope one day I'll be as happy as you are - I'm diligently working toward it. I wish you and your little one continued happiness. \n\nEdit: words \n\nEdit 2: word", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/86t3w7/she_turned_4_years_old_this_week_and_for_having/dw8u2x7/"}
