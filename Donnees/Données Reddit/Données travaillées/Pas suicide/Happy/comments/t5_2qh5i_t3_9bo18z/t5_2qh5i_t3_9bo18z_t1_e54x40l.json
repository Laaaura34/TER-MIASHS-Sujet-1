Not to politicize your life changing moment, but there are a few nationalist sentiments in the comment section. So here's an excerpt from a pretty powerful article:\n\n>The border sends resources and profits one way, and human beings the other. This is how the rich amass great concentrations of wealth: not just by accumulating resources in one place, but also by excluding people from them. This is what all the walls are for. If a prisoner is a person contained by walls, what does that make us? Prisons don\u2019t just contain the people inside them. When the border is everywhere, everyone is transformed into a prisoner or prison guard. **It is easy to be bribed by the advantages of citizenship: being able to travel more freely, being allowed to participate legally in the labor market, being able to access what is left of government assistance, being acknowledged as a part of society.** Yet these privileges come at a terrible cost, for the documents one person holds only have value because others are without them. Their value is based on created scarcity. As long as there is a border between you and those less fortunate than you, you can be sure there will also be borders above you, keeping you from things that you need. **Some people are deported, others are evicted, but the fundamental mechanisms are the same. Who will help you tear down the borders above you, if not the people separated from you by the borders below?**\n\n\nA lot of my family are immigrants, so I know the immense relief that comes with citizenship.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9bo18z/i_became_an_american_citizen_in_june_and_my/e54x40l/"}
