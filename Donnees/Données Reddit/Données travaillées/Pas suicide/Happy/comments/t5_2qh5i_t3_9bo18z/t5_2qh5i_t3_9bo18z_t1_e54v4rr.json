Which is a step up, but I wouldn't say that it'd that much more difficult, especially with a US Green Card, just giving it a cursory look.\n\nIf you have a place that can show differences in payment for visas, length of time, etc, that'd be great. But the website you posted doesn't really show that and that's why I asked in the first place.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9bo18z/i_became_an_american_citizen_in_june_and_my/e54v4rr/"}
