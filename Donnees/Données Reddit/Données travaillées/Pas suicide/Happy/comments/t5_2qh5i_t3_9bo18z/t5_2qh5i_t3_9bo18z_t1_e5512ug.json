I mean what do you mean by \u201cgifts?\u201d \n\nAlso being proud of where you\u2019re born is silly in concept. You didn\u2019t choose where you are born. It\u2019s like being proud you were born with arms. \n\nPlus the US doesn\u2019t have a unique culture. At least not in a historical sense. Well, unless you are Native American, but the settlers did their best to destroy that. US culture is just a mix of all the cultures that arrived. \n\nI don\u2019t hate the US.
