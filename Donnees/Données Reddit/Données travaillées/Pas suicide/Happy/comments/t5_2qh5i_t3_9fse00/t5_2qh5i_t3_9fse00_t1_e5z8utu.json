Come to think of it, I never had any interest in the subject. I only went with Accounting as a career option because I suffer from social anxiety, and if there was a way to minimize social interactions then I thought it would be the career path for me. Truth be told, I don't want to be stuck in a career I have no passion for, but I work as a bookkeeper for now while I pursue my passion as a writer. I won't lie, being a bookkeeper is soul draining, or at least for me it is. \n\nFor the longest time I've wanted to be a writer, but I never thought I was good enough, or I didn't think anyone would enjoy my stories. I would always write short stories during middle school and high school when there was down time, but I let my self-depreciating thoughts keep me from pursuing something I love. I just recently published a book about two days ago, and after finishing the book I felt instant gratification. It's been a long time since I've felt that way, and I treasure that feeling. As long as you get enjoyment out of your career, I say, keep doing it. Better to do something you love and be happy than to do something you hate and be miserable.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9fse00/hey_there_happy_folks_are_you_happy_with_your/e5z8utu/"}
