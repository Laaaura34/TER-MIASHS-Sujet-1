I would definitely love to try out the real one in Metz someday but I guess that's gonna be just a beautiful dream.\n\nI chose the registrations myself. However, when I was in training mode I listened the masterpiece literally hundreds and hundreds of times played by different professionals such as Olivier Latry, Helmut Walcha and Karl Richter. Therefore I think it is safe to say that their versions influenced my choices.\n\nKeep practicing! I really hope you'll master it someday too!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/dqkwst/im_so_happy_today_that_i_wanted_to_share_my_story/ffhqxie/"}
