Halfway through my junior year my thesis was starting to get intense and I was like \"why am I bothering with this? It makes no difference now or after I graduate. Just get a damn B.\" But every semester I'd go into finals with low As and a high B and say \"well it's only a week of hard studying, I'd kick myself if I didn't try.\" I had fully given up senior year after defending my thesis so I was amazed to find myself doing the same thing a few weeks later. \n\nTo be completely honest, I'd still say it was worth it. Pre-covid I had plenty of college fun and was partying all the time, I didn't waste it on doing extra credit and staying in on weekends. To me I see it as something I can remind myself of when I feel kind of worthless. I'm not taken seriously by many people (particularly family) because I'm goofy, so I can have this little confidence boost reminding me that I can be successful and determined. So rather than it being for the sake of my resume, it's more for my pride moving forward.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nmhzl8/i_graduated_college_with_a_40_and_honors_and_yes/gzp3oqv/"}
