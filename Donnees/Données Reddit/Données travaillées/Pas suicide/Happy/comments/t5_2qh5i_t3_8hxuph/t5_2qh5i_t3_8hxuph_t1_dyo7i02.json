The 'El Diablo' loop ride you have is at other parks (although it's called Fireball at ours). The same goes for the fairly new Joker coaster at your park, which can be found in about three other parks.    \n    \nWhile each park has a lot of unique attractions, sometimes certain rides are added to multiple parks. In most instances, they are added to one park the first year, and then based on the Guest feedback, they can find which rides are most highly rated and add them to other parks, which means that they are basically guaranteed to be a success.    \n    \nOn an unrelated note, part of what made this achievement so special is that I actually became close friends with the VP of Project Management from the company who built the ride at all the parks.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8hxuph/obsessed_with_theme_parks_my_whole_life_my_dream/dyo7i02/"}
