I know that the word \u201cfat\u201d isn\u2019t a bad word and these don\u2019t represent me. These represent the judgmental mindset these people have towards others and themselves and their perception of me in their distorted reality is not my problem. I understand, I\u2019ve had many people in my life criticize my body. I\u2019ve also realized that there isn\u2019t a normal weight or body type that fits everyone. You\u2019re weight actually doesn\u2019t matter it\u2019s just a number, what actually represents your health is your lifestyle. Eating a variety of foods you enjoy and exercising how you like without shaming yourself for anything. There\u2019s also no such thing as a \u201cfood addict\u201d. That was just created by society and diet culture because the effects of dieting and restricting cause our bodies to just want those foods more because we\u2019re restricting them you know? I used to feel like a \u201cfood addict\u201d but once i started listening to what my body wants/needs and i ate those foods and everything, i slowly stopped feeling out of control around food. Healing your relationship with food has nothing to do with what you look like and your weight at all, it\u2019s about your mentality around food and everything will fall into place eventually. It\u2019s not easy and I\u2019m someone who is very anti diet because the diet industry only harms peoples lives. Also, the BMI system is completely useless and wrong. I\u2019m sorry if any of this came across as harsh, i just really get upset when i see people falling into the same harmful talk that i used to be in. But it\u2019s so great that you are comfortable in your skin no matter what!! Your health and body size do not dictate the respect and love you inherently deserve:)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nbatzc/ive_struggled_with_body_confidence_and_eating/gxzzisw/"}
