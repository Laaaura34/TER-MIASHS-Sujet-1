It's really awesome to hear that you're feeling more comfortable. Body image issues are really hard to deal with sometimes and it's great that you could finally feel good about yourself! I don't know you, but I'm proud of you too! \n\nI always used to struggled with worrying about how I/my body will be perceived by others and it made it hard for me to pursue relationships and buy or wear certain clothes because I was always so worried about what people would think about how I looked but honestly, the only person you EVER need to please in this world is yourself! As long as you focus on appreciating your own beauty and learning to love yourself and appreciate your body for how it is then you'll have plenty more days like this! \n\nGood luck moving forward and I hope you continue to appreciate yourself! You deserve it!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nbatzc/ive_struggled_with_body_confidence_and_eating/gy0a1ls/"}
