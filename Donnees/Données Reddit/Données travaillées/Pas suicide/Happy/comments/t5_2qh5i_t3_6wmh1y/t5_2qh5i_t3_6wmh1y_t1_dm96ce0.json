You sound like such a positive and humble person :) I admire people who are able to do those tough jobs, my mom's a nurse too and I've seen the incredible work she does. I could never do that with the kind of patience she has and often the mental and physical exhaustion she has to go through. But she's just so passionate about helping others, it seems like you find the same kind of meaning in your work too and that's what keeps you going. Good luck with your next chapter!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/6wmh1y/good_things_come_to_those_who_wait/dm96ce0/"}
