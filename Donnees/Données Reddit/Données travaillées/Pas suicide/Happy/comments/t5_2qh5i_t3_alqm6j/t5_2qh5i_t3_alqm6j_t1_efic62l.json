That's why it's called going through it! \n\nAlso no matter how emotionally damaged you may have been, no matter how broken you feel, you are never too old or broke to completely reinvent yourself. \n\nThose cracks and scars on your heart (and even your body)? That's just where the armor is layered now. Your not broken; you are stronger now than before and better about to withstand the storms of life. \n\nAnyway idk why your post touched me the way it did or why I even typed all that out, but I hope you are able to get that relationship back with your parents and know that there is at least one internet weirdo who care about you.
