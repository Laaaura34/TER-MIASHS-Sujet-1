It's totally possible. The work never ends and that's a good thing. Exploring who you were, who you are and who you want to be is your new job. I recommend tiny bite size pieces though as it can get really overwhelming. Take it on and then allow yourself to let it go so your mind can rest without the chaos of it. Make time for it but then let it be and move on to the living your life part if you know what I mean. It's ok to not be ok sometimes. It's also ok to allow your mind and spirit a break. Walking has helped me tremendously. I'll sometimes go thrift store shopping when I've just had too much of life. It allows me to not have to think about anything important for a few hours. It resets my brain somehow. I hope you find that for yourself. Life will always be hard but every hour of the day doesn't have to be.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/j4s2dt/i_promised_an_update_so_here_it_is_30_days_sober/g7pur5s/"}
