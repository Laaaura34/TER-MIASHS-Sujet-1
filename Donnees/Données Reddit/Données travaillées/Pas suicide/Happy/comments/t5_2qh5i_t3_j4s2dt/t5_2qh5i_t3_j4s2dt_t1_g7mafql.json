I'll be 7 years clean from heroin next valentines day. I just want you to know a few things...   \n\n\nIt does get easier, but it wont go away.   \nYou are strong as FUCK for staying sober for a whole month  \nthere are still days where i have thoughts of using, and thoughts of saying fuck it and relapsing on EVERYTHING, but the cool thing is; the more time you have clean, the easier it is to stay clean. It will ONLY get easier, and if you keep with the fellowship of people around you, you set up a support network, and you set this intention of staying clean, you'll be typing a post like this in 6 years. the biggest thing i can advocate is to hone your self awareness. Self awareness is key because it allows you to see your own warning signs and stop a potential relapse before it happens. I'm rambling at this point but it's only because i'm so happy for you.
