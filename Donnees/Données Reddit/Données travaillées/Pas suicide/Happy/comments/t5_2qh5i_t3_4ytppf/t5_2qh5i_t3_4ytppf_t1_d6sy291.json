For me it took nothing away from the significance. I think I couldn't be any happier if I  found it at a garage sale. Maybe I would have even found it earlier if I  \"allowed\" myself to find it on eBay earlier. Just my 2 cents but I wanted to let you. Wish you good look with your search either way. Take care.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4ytppf/looks_like_things_do_come_back_sometimes/d6sy291/"}
