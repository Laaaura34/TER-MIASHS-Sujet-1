We bought the land 10 years ago for 60k.  It was completely undeveloped so with excavation, water, power, sewer, geo studies, permits we had 100k.  (Residential presite work is not normally that much, we have a 750 foot driveway so running utilities down here was pricy, plus this is an expensive county \ud83d\ude15) \n\nThen the house cost was $350k to build which we got a construction loan for and now converted to our mortgage.  \n\nWestern Washington real estate is stupid expensive right now.   We could never have afforded to buy this house as is,  in this location.   Living in the trailer helped us save for the pre-site work.  \n\nTook a lot of patience and there\u2019s always issues but it was so worth it!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q9i3q4/our_family_of_4_lived_in_a_mouse_infested_trailer/hgz5enl/"}
