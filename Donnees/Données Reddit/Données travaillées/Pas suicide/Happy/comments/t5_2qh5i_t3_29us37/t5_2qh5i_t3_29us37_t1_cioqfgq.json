After this, I'm not so sure \"leagues\" exist. \n\nI was having a really shitty week, I got drunk in the early afternoon and got so aggressive/rowdy I managed to lose my voice before 6 p.m., I was really high... I was gross and sweaty.\n\nI approached a gorgeous woman who, from what I've ascertained, must be at least 30 (I'm 26). A college professor, earning her *second* phd? I was in over my head, as far as I can tell. But it didn't feel like it. We got along so well, had so much in common... It was a really magical and eye-opening moment for me. \n\nDon't be shy! Approach people, as long as you're in a safe environment, of course! :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/29us37/it_coulda_been_better_but_ill_still_smile_about/cioqfgq/"}
