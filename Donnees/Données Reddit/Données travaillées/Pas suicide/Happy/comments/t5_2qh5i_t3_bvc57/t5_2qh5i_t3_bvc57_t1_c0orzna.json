I recently graduated college and have been looking for a job for the past few months.  it's been tough... so many other people are looking for jobs, too.  but I tried to stay positive and do things that make me happy.  patience and determination help a lot... I just found out this morning that I got a job at a new-and-used bookstore!!\n\nanyway, congratulations!  and remember to do what you love.  if things aren't going well, just remember that it's okay.  it will work out.  it's healthy to be a mixture of emotions.\n\nI think of happiness as a kind of ebb and flow.  things are good and bad in life, you can't always help that.  so just go with it :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bvc57/dear_reddit_i_just_turned_21_today_i_graduate/c0orzna/"}
