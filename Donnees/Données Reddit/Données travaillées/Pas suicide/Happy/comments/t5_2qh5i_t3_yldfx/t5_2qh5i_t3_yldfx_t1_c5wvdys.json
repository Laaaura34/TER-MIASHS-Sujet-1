No. I didn't want to die, I just wished I'd never existed in the first place. The OP's post would not have helped me at all.\n\nI still strongly believe that many of the people in my life would be better off had I never existed, I'm just not depressed about it anymore. I accept things as they are and try to do the best that I can do for the people around me.\n\nI think the first step to being happy is to drop all the expectations that you and others have piled on yourself, find out who you really are, and be realistic with your goals in life. With every success there can be failure and with every failure there can be success.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/yldfx/three_reasons_never_to_be_unhappy/c5wvdys/"}
