They sent me to their funding office under women's services (which covers more than that) where I was informed of what I told you in my last post.\n\n Unemployment benefits include vocational retraining and yet not only will they not tell you they will cancel your benefits if you mention you wish to go back to school (I.E. if you are a full time student then you are not looking for work) So Find out who in your desired school to talk to about what is called either worker retraining or CAT (commissioner approved training) which is what the representative will do for you is work around the system to get you enrolled into CAT without tipping your hand to UE that you wish to go back to school full time.\n\nThis funding will get you into your first quarter and get UE off your back concerning weekly job searches so that you can go back to school full time. From then on out, you can ride a pell grant up to a BS degree if you do not have one already.\n\nI stumbled into this and am already into my second quarter.
