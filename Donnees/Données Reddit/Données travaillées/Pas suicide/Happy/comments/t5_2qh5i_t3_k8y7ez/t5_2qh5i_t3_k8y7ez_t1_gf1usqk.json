I'm really excited for you to finish off your loan. The feeling is really relieving. I also kept putting off stuff during college days thinking I had a huge loan to pay off. Never really did anything when all my friends were having the time of their lives. But I'm looking forward to travel a lot more in 2021 once it's safe to do so. \nBut I empathize with what you've been through and am really happy that you will clear off your loan soon! :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/k8y7ez/im_finally_soooo_happy_to_clear_off_my_student/gf1usqk/"}
