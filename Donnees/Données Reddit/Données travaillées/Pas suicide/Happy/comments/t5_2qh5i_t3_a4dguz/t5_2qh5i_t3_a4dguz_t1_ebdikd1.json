But first I like seeing people who have achieved what you have and are in a place of peace and fulfillment. I don't know you but im happy for you beyond words; reading your post made me smile. I have recently experienced this I know it's great but please enjoy yourself and be happy any way you can.\n My advice is take the time to bask in you're awesome. But when you can pass it forward and help someone in any little way to get where you are. It'll add a little happiness on top of that you have. I hope I don't sound negative this advice was given to me by my soon to be wife . I do what I can with what I have . Be happy girl and you do you you!!!!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a4dguz/i_might_be_the_luckiest_girl_in_the_world/ebdikd1/"}
