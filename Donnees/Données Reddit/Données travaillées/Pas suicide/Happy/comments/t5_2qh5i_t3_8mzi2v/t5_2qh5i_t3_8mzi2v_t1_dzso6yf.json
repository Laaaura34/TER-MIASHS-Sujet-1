That is amazing and I wish you all the best in your new role. I also want to mention that the internet is magic. My mom and I have been trying to identify a plant she got from a friend a year ago (which she gave me cuttings of) with no luck. Then BAM I saw your post and there was a plant. Purple Swedish Ivy. I already sent my mom a furious series of excited texts. \n\nThanks for making our night and congrats again!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8mzi2v/i_got_a_job_in_a_greenhouse_dream_job_and_i_feel/dzso6yf/"}
