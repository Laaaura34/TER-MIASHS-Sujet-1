Her smile always looks forced in photos. Recently, tho, she went to an animal sanctuary and got a picture holding a baby animal. It's the best photo of her in years, she has the brightest smile! \n\nYours in this pic is lovely, I'm glad you were able to capture it! Have a lovely visit with your loved ones!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/99raq3/rarely_does_a_picture_capture_my_real_smile_right/e4qa7mv/"}
