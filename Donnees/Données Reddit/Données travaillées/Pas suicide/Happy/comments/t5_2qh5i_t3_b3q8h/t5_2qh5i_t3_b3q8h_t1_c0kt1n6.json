Do you really think that ugly bouquet is the best arrangement of flowers that 58 florists could come up with????\n\nThat's ***exactly*** how things like this are decided in Canada.  \n\nJust for fun, go and apply for a bunch of grants or something where they give out money (supposedly) based on quality of work (like film and art grants, government grants, etc...).  Make up 99 grant applications that are true - and 1 that says you're a Native Indian (or helping disenfranchised women, or from Quebec,  etc...).  You will ***always*** get turned down on virtually all of the 99 application every single time.  But, miraculously, you'll win the other grant ***every single freaking time***.  \n\nThe people deciding these things never vote with their conscience, they always just choose whichever is the most politically correct application with the best human-interest story (or, in the case of the French, Maritimers and Natives, they must do it to meet [illegal?] quotas).
