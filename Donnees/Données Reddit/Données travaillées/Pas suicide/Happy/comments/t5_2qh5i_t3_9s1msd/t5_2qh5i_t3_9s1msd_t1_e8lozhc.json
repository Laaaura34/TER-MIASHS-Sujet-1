My wife and I just had a failed pregnancy 2 weeks ago. Still a bit of hardship to get through but we are slowly moving forward. The really hard thing will be seeing my brother and sister in law who is pregnant. Our due dates were only a week apart and she is starting to show. I'm confident we will be able to get through this and try again soon. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9s1msd/after_my_wife_and_i_had_two_failed_pregnancies/e8lozhc/"}
