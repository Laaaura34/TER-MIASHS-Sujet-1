Thanks for the reply and congrats on your recent move and new home! I\u2019m really grateful that the house doesn\u2019t need much work. Mostly cosmetic touch ups. No major renovations needed. The previous owner was a contractor and kept the house in amazing condition. My girlfriend is way more a planner than I am and has already been looking at Pinterest. You\u2019re right about making it our own. Until it really gets there it\u2019s super strange the feeling of it not quite being your home yet.
