You\u2019ve done something awesome here and it\u2019s yours (well some of it).  Painting with lighter colours makes rooms look bigger and brighter, and so have a bit of a look under the carpet (if u have it) cuz there might be some floorboards underneath that could polish up. Probably get it to what you\u2019re happy with and save knocking out walls etc for later. \nIt may be worth spending a few dollars getting electrical/structural/plumbing looked at just so you know if something big may need doing in the future. Takes away the chance of a nasty surprise. If you haven\u2019t already, getting a decent set of tools is gonna be useful. Nothing over the top but you\u2019ll use them again as soon again on a house job. And finally - those really annoying reality tv house shows - actually have some good ideas. Have fun - this is a big adventure and congrats \ud83d\udc4d", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/abkon1/i_did_a_very_adult_thing_yesterday_to_end_2018/ed1ikmc/"}
