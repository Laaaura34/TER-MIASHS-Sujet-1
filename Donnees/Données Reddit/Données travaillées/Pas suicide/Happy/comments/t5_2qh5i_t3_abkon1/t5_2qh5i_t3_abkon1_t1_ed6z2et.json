My advice (from owning 3 home over 30:years old each), find the nearest Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s. You\u2019ll be going there at least once a week.  Learn basic home repair (painting, spackleing, finished carpentry, etc.). Let pros handle the electrical and plumbing, but for everything else, there is no need to hire a handyman.  Just remember, you can do a half-assed job for free so don\u2019t pay someone to do it for you.  Home repair is just as effective a form of therapy as seeing a psychiatrist and less expensive.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/abkon1/i_did_a_very_adult_thing_yesterday_to_end_2018/ed6z2et/"}
