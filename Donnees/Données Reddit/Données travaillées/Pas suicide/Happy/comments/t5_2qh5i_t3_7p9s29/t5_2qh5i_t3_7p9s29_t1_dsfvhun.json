All my family and friends were in New York, and all the good and bad that comes with that. I didn't plan match, and looking back I wish I did some more, but not once have I regretted my choice. \nIt will not be easy, leaving the life you've built over the years is tough. You'll feel alone and question yourself, but it gets better. I've now been in Colorado for a year and a half and not only have I started to build a life here, but it's better than what I had. \nI'm not sure if this helps much, but think about five years from now if you leave vs if you don't. You can always come back to your roots but if you don't leave and follow your heart you'll be stuck and always wonder what if.\n\nAnd if you find yourself getting lonely in Colorado feel free to hmu as a new friend!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7p9s29/guys_i_want_to_ask_you_something/dsfvhun/"}
