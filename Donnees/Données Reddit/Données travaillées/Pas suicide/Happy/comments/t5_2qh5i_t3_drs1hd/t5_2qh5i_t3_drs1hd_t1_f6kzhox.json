Woohoo! Having a baby is a life changing experience. It didn\u2019t fully grasp how much things had changed for me for quite a while. I wish you all the best. Here is a pro-tip from one mother to another: If you have a child who has colic, take them to the doctor as many times as you need. There is more than one solution to colic. \nAlso, remember that if you get postpartum, it is okay to take care of yourself. Healthy mom equals healthy baby. I wish someone had made me go when I got it. Having a baby is hard. It\u2019s okay to ask for help!\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/drs1hd/after_four_years_of_infertility_im_28_weeks/f6kzhox/"}
