I remember my 4-year-old self finding out my mom was pregnant with twins and crying to my dad because I wanted a twin too. He apologized and said, \"Sorry honey, it doesn't work that way!\" I've always been jealous of the bond between them, but I love them to pieces.  Thanks for sharing this - it put a smile on my face! :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1q518h/congratulated_my_twin_on_his_good_news_and_then/cd9p781/"}
