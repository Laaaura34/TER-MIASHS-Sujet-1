It takes good sound financial understanding to do that. Also thinking about your future fiancee is a great thing too. I just graduated college 20k in loans, I am having difficulty finding a job, but what I did find out was that you can defer loan repayment if you can't find full time job. I deferred, but I am going to pay my interest so it doesn't capitalize, but I won't pay my loans back just yet because I don't want to burn thru my savings. In short what I want to tell you is that in case you run into problems paying your loans back, defer. They have many options if you can't locate a job or if you other obligations to meet and can't pay back, find a way to suspend/defer so your loans are not going to be defaulted. Congrats on managing your fiancee well :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1qjqy8/i_just_had_to_share_i_am_officially_credit_card/cddx89q/"}
