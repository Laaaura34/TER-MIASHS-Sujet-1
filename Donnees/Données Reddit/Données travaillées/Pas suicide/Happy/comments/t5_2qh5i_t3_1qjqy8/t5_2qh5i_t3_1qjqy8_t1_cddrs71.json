I bet it feels great. I've got 3 maxed out cards I'm paying off now. 1 of them will be done by the end of the year (using my bonus to pay it off) and only got two left. I'm paying more then the minimum and have it under control and am not collecting anymore debt but it feels like a weight you know. So good job man, keep it up and don't start using it again, cause before long your back where you were.
