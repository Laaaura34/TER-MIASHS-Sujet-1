The site has begun to grow (700+ users right now) and I envision it serving as a resource for both research and general educational purposes alike.  To this end, I've designed a number of interactive apps (including custom scatter plots, heat maps, color-coded word clouds, response search queries, geographic maps, and more) that you can use to explore the data upon completing the 20-minute survey (which has been described as both interesting and cathartic).  At the end of the month, I will begin in-depth analysis using a variety of computational content analysis techniques, which I believe promises to yield profound insights into the human spirit and various \"recipes\" for leading a full, satisfying, and meaningful life.  Anyway, I've been told that the website's worth checking out, and any and all feedback is welcome!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/thbcu/ever_wonder_how_to_lead_a_happy_fulfilling_and/c4mlrmf/"}
