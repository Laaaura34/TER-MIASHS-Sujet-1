I was lucky enough to have people in my corner to support me and I relied on them to help me through. I think that is the most important thing. Find people who you can confide in and call on when you are unsteady. I understand that not everyone has that luxury, but it has always been what I rely on. Whether it is family, friends, or strangers in a similar position; there are people out there that can help. I try to be that person for anyone I know is struggling now. And I am willing to be that for anyone reading this that needs an ear!\n\nAnd be stubborn! In this case stubbornness was a positive, lol! It really is amazing what a person can accomplish when they finally make up their mind wholeheartedly.\n\nI know this was a whole lot of nothing, but I it is what helps me. Everyone needs to find something different to hold on to in order to get through. Everyone's recovery will be different.\n\nFor anyone out there that is struggling, keep working! It is worth it! You are worth it! I had setbacks and relapses too. Everyone does. But you can do it!\n\n(Sorry if this was a way too long and not helpful answer. Also, I feel I got a little preachy and I apologize, lol!)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/otiuv7/celebrating_15_years_of_sobriety_incredibly_lucky/h6w3dw7/"}
