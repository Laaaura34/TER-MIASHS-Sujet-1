Not trying to bring anyone down. Just a humble suggestion. Hell I was eating chicken wings up until December of last year! They\u2019re tasty. I get it. But I realized lots of things are tasty - including plants. Its just crazy how many people & things can be positively impacted by simple diet changes (the health of OP, his wife, his family, friends, neighbours, generations to come, the earth & environment, & of course the animals we share this planet with). There is potential for happiness to be increased tenfold :) ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9e0803/chicken_wings_are_the_secret_to_a_happy_marriage/e5m8u9d/"}
