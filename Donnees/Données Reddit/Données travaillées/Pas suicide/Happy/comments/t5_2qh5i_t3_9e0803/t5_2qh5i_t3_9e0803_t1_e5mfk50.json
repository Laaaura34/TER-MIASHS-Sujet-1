It\u2019s the small things, the small efforts you make for your significant other when they least expect it, that make relationships special. \n\nI recently made pasta for dinner, and usually I would make a small pasta as that\u2019s what my husband prefers. However, I really wanted linguini. So, I got out the linguini and I broke it in half before boiling it. A few minutes later, my husband said, \u201cI almost asked you why you broke the pasta in half, but I know you did it for me. You\u2019re so sweet.\u201d He had the biggest grin on his face. \n\nIt was such an insignificant action in the grand scheme of life, but important in communicating how much I care about that man!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9e0803/chicken_wings_are_the_secret_to_a_happy_marriage/e5mfk50/"}
