Arent, we born with no thoughts of gender and gender roles. Wouldn't gender be taught to us early on. If for example a baby was born on an island and somehow survive without outside influence till 18. would it still feel weird about its body parts? Would it still want to dress up a certain way? Isn't all of this a concept in our own mind. When does it become a severe gender dysphoria or a normal \"healthy transitioning\". Anyways cool that you are happy.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/by2pse/after_years_of_struggling_with_being_comfortable/eqcl297/"}
