Don't take things too seriously.  Ask her questions, let her talk about herself, don't interrupt, have fun.\n\nAlso, have a plan.  Girls don't like indecision / hesitancy, so have an itinerary with plans B and C for everything.\n\n(Some women say they like spontaneity.  This is not true.  What they really like is well-planned things that they haven't been told about, so if you've got cool stuff up your sleeve that you can mention casually as options for the evening, you'll look like a winner.)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9zj7p/today_i_asked_out_a_girl_for_the_first_time_ever/c0f5jdv/"}
