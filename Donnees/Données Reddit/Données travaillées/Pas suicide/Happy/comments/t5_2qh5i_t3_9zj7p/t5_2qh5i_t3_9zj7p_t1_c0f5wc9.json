I'd pretty much given up hope by then too, but decided that I wouldn't stress out about it either -- I'd just try to be content with whatever fate had in store me.\n\nAnyway, I eventually did meet the right girl and almost from the first we knew that we were meant for each other.  We celebrated our seventh wedding anniversary this year and are looking forward to many more to come.\n\nSo my advice is to relax.  If you eventually do meet the right girl, you'll know it.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9zj7p/today_i_asked_out_a_girl_for_the_first_time_ever/c0f5wc9/"}
