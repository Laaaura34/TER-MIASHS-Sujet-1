He eventually owned 2 grocery stores and 2 buildings before selling all except the house here once he retired.  My grandmother was a seamstress for most of her life and still spends time fixing all of our clothing because she loves to. They had 2 daughters who in turn each had 2 kids each and I am the oldest grandchild. \nThey are both amazingly spiritual people who are well respected in their community. Everyone is welcome in their home and they\u2019ve given so much of their life to helping the people back in DR by donating clothes and money to the community. \n\nTo this day she cooks for everyone (my parents live on the second floor and my aunt lives two blocks away) which is a tradition that keeps our family so close together.  I\u2019ve since moved out but I\u2019m still close so I can see these two as much as I can!!\n\nThanks for asking about them and let me know if you have other questions!  Sorry I don\u2019t know when they got married but can follow up when I find out :) \n\nI took this photo on August 8th for his 90th birthday and it\u2019s my most cherished one yet.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p2dy8u/my_grandparents_in_front_of_the_house_my_whole/h8k903j/"}
