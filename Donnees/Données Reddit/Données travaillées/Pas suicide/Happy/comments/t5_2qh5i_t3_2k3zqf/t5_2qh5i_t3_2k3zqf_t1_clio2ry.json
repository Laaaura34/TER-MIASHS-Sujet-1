You can have an opinion about how you don't think age will be a factor in *your* marriage. But you don't get to have an opinion on whether age is a factor in divorce rates. Divorce rates are statistical facts, and it's a fact that people who marry very young get divorced at much higher rates. Divorce rates are finally falling after decades of increasing, and one factor is that people are waiting longer to get married.\n\nOf course, statistics are not predictions of outcomes for everyone. Plenty of people still get married young and stay together forever. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2k3zqf/in_2012_one_of_my_best_friends_asked_me_to_be_his/clio2ry/"}
