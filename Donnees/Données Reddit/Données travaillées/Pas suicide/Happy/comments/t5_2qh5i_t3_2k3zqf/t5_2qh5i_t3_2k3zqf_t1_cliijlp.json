You do, hopefully, change, and you see a lot of early marriages fail as a result because the people grow apart.\n\nFrom an outside perspective, there seems to be a very strong \"you're 18 so you're an adult and fully formed\" attitude in america which the rest of the world finds confusing because we know things like marriage can wait, so give it time.  Personally I put it down to the prevalence of religion in the US - it's forbidden to \"live in sin\" hence if you want to be close to someone there is peer pressure to marry them and validate it.\n\nTo counter your attempt at a dig, the truly mature option would be to acknowledge that people don't hit their adult stride until their 30s, typically, to acknowledge there is a risk, and therefore play it safe but continue to be together with the person you love, cohabit etc.  You can leave the larger commitments until you're more settled later on.  If it doesn't work out, you'll have a divorce, selling a house, and heaven forbid children to deal with.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2k3zqf/in_2012_one_of_my_best_friends_asked_me_to_be_his/cliijlp/"}
