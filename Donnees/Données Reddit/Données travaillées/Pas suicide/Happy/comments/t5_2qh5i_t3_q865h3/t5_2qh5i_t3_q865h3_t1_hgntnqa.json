It was a big deal in the mid 90's.  I'm sure it's still a big deal now, congratz on a positive reunion.\n\nHis biological father had passed away but he got a hold of his uncle who was skeptical on the phone.  We arranged to take the 6 hour drive as part of a summer camping trip to go see them and my dad got out of the car with his file of evidence to try to show this person that he was family.  As we walk up to the porch his uncle came out of the house and just said \"You can put the file away.  You look exactly like him\".", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q865h3/today_i_found_my_biological_mother_and_her/hgntnqa/"}
