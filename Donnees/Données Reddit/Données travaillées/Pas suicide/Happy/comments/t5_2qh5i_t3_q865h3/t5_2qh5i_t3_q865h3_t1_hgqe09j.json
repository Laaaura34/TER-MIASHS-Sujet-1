Never called me, or wrote, or visited. Literally never even heard his voice again until I was 15 and he called:\n\n\"HI my I talk to @<#&'#<\u00f7?\"\n\n\"May I ask who's calling?\n\n\"Yeah it's &@&$.\"\n\n\"Hey! Hi! It's me, your son!\"\n\n\"OH hi. Can I talk to your mom?\"\n\n\n35 years went by and I decided to try to find him....and I did. On Facebook. Sent a message...got messages back. He blamed my mom for never letting him see me. We talked for 2 weeks. After that he ghosted again and I haven't heard from him in 5 years (he's still alive best I can see).\n\n\nI'm happy for you  and I don't know the story about why y'all've been apart, but please tread carefully and manage your expectations of this new relationship.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q865h3/today_i_found_my_biological_mother_and_her/hgqe09j/"}
