You must be so happy. \n\nI had been a dream of mine to design a board game since I was a kid. \n\nThis year, thanks to working from home, my seven year old and I finally started our journey. \n\nWe finished the first prototype this past weekend and played our first game! I won. But my kid thought it was really fun!\n\nI know **nothing** about the industry, but it\u2019s been fun just brainstorming ideas with my son and playing a game we made together.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/k5zrrc/after_years_of_work_i_finally_got_my_game_on/gejpirr/"}
