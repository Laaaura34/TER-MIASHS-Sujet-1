One player, the band leader, places two category cards face up on the table (color, animal, body part, profession, etc) and everyone else at the table, the band members, must come up with original band names that include words fitting these cards. The best one, as judged by the band leader, is the winner.  \n\n\nAnother deck of cards, the modify cards, can add extra criteria to the band name. Like forcing it to fit a specific genre, making it fit a certain format (rhyming, repeating words, excess punctuation), or lets you add and remove category cards from play. The twist is the one modify card you can play in the round gets added by the band members. NOT the band leader.  \n\n\nSome optional rules include bonus points for thinking of real bands that fit the cards in play, or adding a time limit to each round. My favorite part though is the tie breaker round. If the band leader cant choose a winner they can pick any number of players to go to the tie breaker. They have to come up with an album and three songs by their fictional band. Usually you can pick a clear winner from those.  \n\n\nAnd that's the game in a nutshell!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/k5zrrc/after_years_of_work_i_finally_got_my_game_on/geiamqj/"}
