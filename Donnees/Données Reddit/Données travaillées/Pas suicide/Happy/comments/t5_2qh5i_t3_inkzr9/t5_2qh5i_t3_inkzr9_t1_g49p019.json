I wore fake nails for 25 years. I took them off the in March, and about two months later, realized I hadn't bitten them for a while. Now they are as long as the fake nails I wore and are much healthier.\n\nYou might consider using a clear nail hardener that will make them less likely to peel or get damaged. My nails were so thin at first that getting a hair caught at the edge would slice into it. \n\nCongrats to you.
