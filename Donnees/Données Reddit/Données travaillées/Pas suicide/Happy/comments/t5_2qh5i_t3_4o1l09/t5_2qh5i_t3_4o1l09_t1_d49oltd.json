This company came after me, which was surreal.  I sat there overlooking Manhattan just trying to figure out how I had gotten there, but decided to just be happy about it. I am glad you got the gig!! They reached out to me moving it forward today, so I am hoping for the same result as you and will post a picture of my smiling mug if this happens.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4o1l09/big_interview_today_wish_me_luck/d49oltd/"}
