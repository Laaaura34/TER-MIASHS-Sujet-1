Words can't express how thankful I am for all of the overwhelmingly supportive and positive comments! I wish I could reply to all of you individually, but unfortunately I have a job.\n\nTo address a few questions and concerns: lots of you looked at my post history. I lost the weight 3 years ago actually, and I did fall into ED behavior that I have since struggled with and I have struggled with self harm for 12 years (I'm 21 now). I have struggled with major depression for just as long, and after 7 years on the same meds, I have finally come to terms with the fact I needed a change.\n\nTo those who told me to cover up (I'm in my freaking work uniform -- it's literally just a work selfie, boobs unintentional) or that I need to get off my meds: y'all are a bunch of ninnies.\n\nThank you, Reddit!\n\nEDIT: Also my ex was NOT abusive. Our break was mutual. I appreciate the support, but maybe I should have worded the title better. I would not have called the relationship toxic. I was never perfect in my relationship, the break was mutual, and he is a good person.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8ygqd4/down_90_lbs_almost_done_with_my_nursing_degree_on/e2bk1gh/"}
