You are far too beautiful to be put down by anyone.   \n\n Start where you stand and never mind the past,  \nThe past won't help you in beginning new,  \nIf you have left it all behind at last  \nWhy, that's enough, you're done with it, you're through;  \nThis is another chapter in the book,  \nThis is another race that you have planned,  \nDon't give the vanished days a backward look,  \nStart where you stand.   \n\n\nThe world won't care about your old defeats  \nIf you can start anew and win success;  \nThe future is your time, and time is fleet  \nAnd there is much of work and strain and stress;  \nForget the buried woes and dead despairs,  \nHere is a brand-new trial right at hand,  \nThe future is for him who does and dares,  \nStart where you stand.   \n\n\nOld failures will not halt, old triumphs aid,  \nTo-day's the thing, to-morrow soon will be;  \nGet in the fight and face it unafraid,  \nAnd leave the past to ancient history,  \nWhat has been, has been; yesterday is dead  \nAnd by it you are neither blessed nor banned;  \nTake courage, man, be brave and drive ahead,  \nStart where you stand.
