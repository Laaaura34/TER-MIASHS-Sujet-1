Somehow people got the idea he was abusive and toxic. None of these assumptions are true. I also may have been misinterpreting what you said, but I did not come here looking for a fuck ton of attention. This post just blew up for no reason.\n\nI do invite you to consider learning about brain chemistry, clinical and chronic depression, and the history and mechanisms of action of psychoactive medications and how they affect the body. What's funny is, my major medication change was for migraines! LOL\n\nAlso, I do pity your opinion and I will consider maybe you have been impacted by others with mental illness and that's why you hate those who have self harmed. I am not proud but I am allowed to have made mmistakes that are evident on my body. I am a 4.0 honors student with a minor, graduating early, and  who's excellent in the clinical setting. I hope next time you are not so quick to judge those like me... especially when your life is in their hands. But even if you do, I will treat you the same way I do any patient -- with respect. And I will tell you, I have never had a patient who felt uncomfortable with me.\n\nAlso, your dog is cute.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8ygqd4/down_90_lbs_almost_done_with_my_nursing_degree_on/e2d5q2n/"}
