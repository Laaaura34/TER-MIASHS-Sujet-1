Lou (my dad\u2019s girlfriend) was a dance instructor all her life and my dad just loves to dance. They\u2019re both really spry still and both happened to have the same idea that they\u2019d like to start a little dance club at the local senior center...they did not know each other. Then on the same day, at the same time, they independently stopped into the senior center to tell their idea to the director. Lou was standing talking to the director about her idea when my dad walked in to do the same. They hit it off immediately and went for a walk and then to his house afterward for root beer floats. They\u2019re so sweet together. They love holding hands, watching the deer visiting my dad\u2019s yard and sharing chocolate dipped ice cream cones.
