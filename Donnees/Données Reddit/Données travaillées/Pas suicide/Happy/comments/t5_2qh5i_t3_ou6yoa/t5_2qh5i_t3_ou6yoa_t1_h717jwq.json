Thank you for wanting to work in such a challenging and taxing environment. Folks in your position are taken for granted, especially during times such as these. It amazes me how *hundreds of thousands* in the medical community have put their all into caring for the public, even in the face of people who deny there is a public health crisis and/or refuse to take basic steps to protect themselves and others.\n\nMedical workers are heroes, but they shouldn't have to be. Thank you for all you have and will do!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ou6yoa/after_2_years_of_applying_i_finally_became_an_er/h717jwq/"}
