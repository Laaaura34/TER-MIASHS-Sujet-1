Cakes are good too, but the coffee commitment gets you there early and gets you familiar with the regulars and helps you find a home group. This is a journey with no destination. You\u2019re going to get some tools that will help replace alcohol as a solution, but for most alcoholics there is no real \u201ccure\u201d. That\u2019s why everything says one day at a time.
