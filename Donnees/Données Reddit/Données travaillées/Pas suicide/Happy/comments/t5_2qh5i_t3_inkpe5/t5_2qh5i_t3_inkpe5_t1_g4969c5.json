Just please remember one thing. You are not forever broken. You are not forever an alcoholic. You are more than an addict and you can be fixed. I was a functional alcoholic for 15 years and today I am not a slave to alcohol any longer. If the brotherhood and camaraderie of AA can help you avoid the drink, then by all means do it, but please don't fall into the trap of thinking you are worthless and helpless without your higher power.\n\nYou are more than your addiction.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/inkpe5/this_has_been_a_long_time_coming_i_have_tried_to/g4969c5/"}
