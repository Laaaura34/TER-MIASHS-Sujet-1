I had a late-night conversation with her about it, she explained what she was dealing with, and I had no idea what to say. So I proceeded to the logical next step: write a song about it. Took me about a week, and it was well worth it.\n\nEdit: to all the people taking issue with me calling her \"brah\" at the end, I asked her out about a week before I started the song and she said that she thought I was \"rad\" but didn't want to date anybody. Also we're from California, where that's a little more normal. Point is, she already knows I like her, and this was not actually about getting in her pants.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2n8ydf/wrote_a_song_for_a_girl_and_sent_it_to_her_this/cmbgbdy/"}
