My family isn't great but that's not the reason as to why I want to die, I've had decent experiences and a good reputation at class and for the most part, I'm an average, self-sustaining individual. For the longest time, I thought that the reason as to why I want to commit suicide is because of my rather bleak outlook on life but that's not really the case. I know myself well-enough that that's a lie that I try to convince myself, I'm aware that life is tough, I'm aware that it's unfair, but I'm also aware that you can still enjoy life despite all the troubles that there may be. \n\nSo why exactly do I want to die? Has someone else experienced something similar to this before? It's been bugging me for a while, I'd appreciate some input.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qb5uon/having_suicidal_ideations_but_not_knowing_why/", "title": "Having suicidal ideations but not knowing why.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "EilNer", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634626005, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qb5uon/having_suicidal_ideations_but_not_knowing_why/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427202.4516792, "replies_charged": false}
