For years, I would have dark / intrusive thoughts, but I always assumed they were normal and would dissipate with time. After a recent breakup, I realize that I am the monster. I'm not a victim of circumstances; I'm not a victim at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's no point in writing a long story detailing our arguments, how they began, or how I felt before they got to a point of no return. It just started out as a slow progression. Raising my voice, yelling, showing no empathy, swearing, name calling, physical violence. It was never my intention to hurt her emotionally of physically. It would be under horrible circumstances, she would try to swat my phone out of my hand, so I grabbed her wrist and gave her a bruise. She sat on a chair across from me and lectured me for three hours telling me how much of a horrible person I was, so I grabbed her feet and dragged her off the chair. She would block the door from me leaving the house, so I would have to pull her out of the way. It was under horrible circumstances. It was such a toxic relationship on both ends, but the blame was always on me. I was the horrible person, I was the one who couldn't handle conflict. It's true, I couldn't handle anything, I have violent mood swings. I could never see the bigger picture in our arguments, I was always so fixated on one particular aspect. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt drove her crazy. I could see we weren't working out.. I tried to end it on multiple occasions. Apparently this was another abusive trait that I had, to assert dominance and control of the relationship by letting her come back to me. Maybe I tried to manipulate her sub-consciously, but it was never a direct intention of mine. Eventually she had enough, she started to fall out of love. She walked away from the relationship and started dating a new man within five days. She told me how happy she was with this man, how he made her feel, how well he treated her (sexually and emotionally). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe reached out to my ex-girlfriend from several years ago to discuss my behaviour. I dated my ex-girlfriend for 2 years, and she cheated on me for the last eight months. When I found out she cheated on me, I was devestated and hurt, I wanted to make her feel the same pain. She had begged and pleaded with me not to tell the other guy because he was unaware of her seeing me and she was madly inlove with him. She begged and offered anything in return for me to keep my mouth shut. I sent her a screenshot telling her how she could continue to give me oral and I won't tell him. I never carried through with that promise, as I told the man the very same day.. but she saved that screenshot and sent it to my newly made ex-girlfriend. Together, they agreed that I was a total piece of shit. She told me how horrible I was, I was never a good person, I was never a good boyfriend. She told me that I had no personality, that I have no drive in life, that I am selfish. I will never be good enough for her, or for anyone else as long as I live. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot only was I emotional and physically abusive, I was now considered to be a sexual abuser from the past as well. I sat in my apartment for weeks playing every scenario through my brain. I excused my behaviours, I rationalized certain events. The sexual abuse: I just wanted to make her feel the same pain. The emotional abuse: I was pushed to my limit, she wouldn't let me speak in arguments, she constantly berated and belittled me, she provoked a situation by ignoring me and covering her ears when I tried to speak. Physical abuse: I was trying to leave the room, I was trying to distance myself, I was trying to protect my property. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did a lot of digging and research into what could cause this behavior from me. Why do I love someone so much one minute, and the next I am pushing them away at all costs? I will never be able to find someone as this woman. Someone who loved so unconditionally, someone who cared so much, someone who was so attractive it hurt. I came to conclusion that I have a mental disorder, I believe I have BPD. It's not an excuse for my behavior, but rather an explanation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToo much has happened. I will never be able to right the wrongs I have caused. I will never be able to hold my partner again. I will never be able to love as much as I did. I feel such a void inside of me. I feel so horrible and sick. I know I have a problem, and I'm scared that I will never get better. Even if I find a new partner, I fear that my ex will contact her to warn her. I fear that I will hurt any new partner. I'm a monster. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will never get better.. I have no personality, I have no drive, I have no empathy. I will hurt someone again. I don't want to live like this. I don't want to live with this burden, I don't want to live without her. I am sick, and I don't see it getting any better. There is nothing I can do, I simply just want to die and never have to endure this pain, I never want to put someone through that pain again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gp6o5e/self_destructive_tendencies_starting_to_realize_i/", "title": "Self Destructive Tendencies - Starting to realize I am a Monster", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ThrowRA-Abuser", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1590247186, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gp6o5e/self_destructive_tendencies_starting_to_realize_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422549.5382626, "replies_charged": false}
