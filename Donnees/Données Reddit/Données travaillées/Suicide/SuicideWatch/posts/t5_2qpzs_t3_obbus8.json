But I do believe that it shouldn\u2019t be scrutinized as it is. Almost every human has or will experience traumatic events in their life and for some they will only ever experience pain. So isn\u2019t it natural to be depressed and think that life isn\u2019t that great. When I talk about mental health with friends and family, everyone admitted to be depressed/ suicidal at one point. So why is it still such a taboo subject? I think if it was more talked about and accepted part of human behavior then there would be less people feeling alone and shameful for their thoughts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/obbus8/why_isnt_suicidal_thoughts_more_normalized/", "title": "Why isn\u2019t suicidal thoughts more normalized?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CHERRYBLOWS", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625105065, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/obbus8/why_isnt_suicidal_thoughts_more_normalized/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428431.128247, "replies_charged": false}
