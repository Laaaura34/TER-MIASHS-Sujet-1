I have become irredeemably depressed within the past 6 months, to the point where I say like 5 words per day. I had a small group of friends at my college (i'm a sophomore) which I have since blocked out and isolated myself from. My friends from high school are long gone, living their own lives. I have zero friends. Nobody I can turn to. Nobody shows me compassion. I'm alone. And my social inhibitions will not let me dig myself out of this hole. I'm such a loser. I literally can't go on if I can't figure out how to talk to people. I hate myself so much and I want to die.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7df274/i_have_avoidant_personality_disorder_and_it_made/", "title": "I have avoidant personality disorder and it made me lose all of my friends.
