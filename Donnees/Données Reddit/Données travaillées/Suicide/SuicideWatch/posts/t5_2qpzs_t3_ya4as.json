Just 2 months ago, I was literally sitting on my couch with a noose in my hands about to end it all.  About 1.5 months ago, I was issued a Temporary Detention Order and forced to go to the Psych Ward of my local hospital against my will.  I am now seeing a psychologist and I am in regular communication with my family.  This summer, after 2 years of letting my life fall apart, I finished my classes with all A's (I haven't done that since High School).  And as of today, I have a job to help pay for college!\n\nI can't imagine that just 2 months ago, I was ready to give up and throw everything away.  I felt the exact same feelings a lot of you are going through.  I felt alone, worthless, hopeless, unwanted, unloved, abandoned and forgotten.  I want you to know that those are all LIES!  No matter how hard it is for you to believe, there is someone out there who cares about you.\n\nSW has been a huge help in the past for me when I've struggled with depression.  I can't tell you how serious my suicidal thoughts and plans were. I was even ordering sedatives over the internet that I could overdose on.  I don't know any of you, but seeing the hurt that you all are going through assures me that I'm not alone in my struggles.\n\nI know you think that no one out there cares about you or would even miss you if you left.  I have had those exact same feelings.  I constantly would tell myself, \"If you killed yourself, nobody would even show up to your funeral.\"  I can tell you as someone who has experienced the same Hell that you're going through, that ***I*** care about you.  ***I*** want to see you succeed and be happy.  It pains me so much to see people feeling this degree of pain, having experienced it myself.\n\nI want to give you some advice that helped me get through it!\n\nYou have to learn to recognize intrusive thoughts.  Recognize them as **LIES** and rebuke them immediately.  Do not entertain those thoughts for even a split second.  If you let your mind go off on its own, your thoughts **will** destroy you.  You are loved and cared for deeply.\n\nSecondly, Your worth is **NOT** determined by how many friends you have or how many people like you.  ***You*** determine what your life is worth.  You can achieve anything that you put your mind to.  I used to constantly stress over whether or not my friends liked me.  I wouldn't hear from any of my \"friends\" for months, and I'd tell myself, \"You could just die and nobody would notice or care.\"  This mindset drove a lot of my suicidal behavior.  I realized that I was putting my worth and happiness in the hands of *other* people.  Who gives a SHIT what Joe Schmoe, your old high school buddy, thinks of you?!  If he/she doesn't care about you, then why should you care about them?  Your life's value is what ***YOU*** make of it.\n\nEveryone has their vice.  Mine was drugs.  You CANNOT let drugs take control of your life.  I know it's scary to face the world on your own, but sitting on your couch high as a kite is not going to help you in any way.  I know it's hard to muster up the willpower, especially if you are going through a physical addiction to a substance, but you **MUST** tell yourself that the drugs are running your life, and that it is absolutely necessary to get rid of them.  Don't even look at it as a decision.  Look at it as an inevitability.  How many times have you heard someone say that drugs did great things for their life?  You're going to have to give up the drugs at some point to have a successful, fulfilling life. Why not start now?  I can tell you that since I stopped using hallucinogens, I feel better than I've felt in YEARS.  There is NO better feeling than getting everything done off your to-do list and then relaxing.\n\n**STAY BUSY!**\n\nI can't stress that enough.  There is so much truth in the saying \"Idle hands are the Devil's tools.\"  Here's some ideas to keep you busy during the day:\n\n* Get in shape\n* Learn a new language\n* Go Kayaking\n* Go hiking/camping\n* Collect something\n* Volunteer somewhere\n* Take an online course (or go to khanacademy.org and learn something new for free)\n* Learn a programming language and make an app for your computer or smartphone (there's tons of books and online materials)\n* Make a blog\n* Learn a musical instrument\n* Join a local community (Could be a church, a hiking group, a book club, a movie club, etc.)\n* Go to yard sales and thrift stores\n* Watch a documentary or a movie you wouldn't normally watch\n* Write poetry or a short story or a song\n* Do some puzzles\n* Get organized\n\nThere's literally an endless number of things you can do to keep yourself busy no matter where you live. (comment if you want to add more ideas)\n\nAlso, I know that for me, my depression is at its worst when I'm lying in bed unable to fall asleep.  I take adderall for my ADHD and it sometimes gives me insomnia.  I recently started using a storm sound generator and meditation tracks, and they have worked wonders for my sleep schedule.  They help settle your mind and fall asleep.\n\nI also want to encourage you to seek help if you need it.  I was furious when I was taken to the hospital, but it ended up being a huge wake-up-call for me.  I am not sure if it's the case everywhere, but where I live, if you are issued a TDO, you don't need insurance to go to the hospital.  Look online or ask a local counseling center about group counseling.  Your pain and suffering is nothing to be ashamed of.  Nobody is going to judge you in the groups, because chances are, someone in your group is worse off than you.  Don't hesitate to go to an Alc Anon, Narc Anon, etc.\n\nI really hope that this post could offer some hope and encouragement to those of you out there that are suffering.  These are things that have helped me deal with my depression and suicidal tendencies.\n\nI want you to know that I *LOVE* you, and it fills my heart with sorrow to know that people out there are going through so much pain.  Please comment or PM if you want to add anything or if you have a question for me.  I'm open to discuss pretty much anything.  If you need a friend to talk to, I'm here.
