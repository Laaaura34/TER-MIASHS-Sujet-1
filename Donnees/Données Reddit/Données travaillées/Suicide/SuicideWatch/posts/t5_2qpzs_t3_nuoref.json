I watch my coworkers talking, joking etc. but when they try to engage me I have literally nothing to say. Not a single thought comes to my mind. People have given up on me and I don't blame them. I'm here but really not here at all. I feel so many things: guilt, emptiness, loneliness, sadness, fear, boredom. I think it's changed me and I worry that it's too late to get better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nuoref/my_life/", "title": "My Life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Necessary-Emotion-14", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623102977, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nuoref/my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427042.2947388, "replies_charged": false}
