I'm BP2, I have DP/DR, sensory issues, and vertigo as of recent. I take quite a few meds that are designed to help... YET I still feel like shit. I'm tired of being hurt by people that I consider friends. I'm tired of being lonely and yet I can't find a reason to be social. I'm too scared of it. I feel so hopeless and depressed. My parents would never understand. I try to explain my mental illnesses to them and they don't understand. They don't understand that they don't understand, if that makes sense. I feel so alone and I honestly can't find many reasons to keep living. I don't want to die but I also don't want to live. I wake up and wait to fall asleep again everyday. I just don't know why I'm here or why I need to be here anymore. It's so hard for me these days. I can't believe I'm 19 and I'm dealing with all of this. I have a therapist but I honestly don't see the point in going anymore. I've written a few suicide notes a month or two ago and I was going to give them to some \"friends\" but I didn't, thank god. I wouldn't tell anyone in real life because of the consequences that would have. I'm writing this in a middle of a zoom class because I need to vent and really I'm too distracted with these thoughts to be able to focus. Good luck to everyone here. I wish you all good health and I hope you're doing better than me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbewhj/im_so_tired/", "title": "I'm so tired", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sp3nSur", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634660252, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbewhj/im_so_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426378.1505733, "replies_charged": false}
