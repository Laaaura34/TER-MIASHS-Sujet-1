If I think about an hour from now, I think about how bored I am, how I\u2019d rather just be asleep cause there\u2019s nothing I wanna do, nothing interests me, nothing is fun to me anymore, nothing feels even remotely worth the effort. And if I think about further into my future, on a more big picture scale I just think about how all my mental illnesses make it virtually impossible for me to ever have a life where I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m treading water just to stay breathing, all the while never getting any of the things that might actually make some of this a little easier.\n\nThe list of diagnoses I\u2019ve had thrown at me feels endless at this point, major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, BPD, Bipolar Type 2, C-PTSD, anorexia, avoidant personality disorder, who knows how many of them are actually accurate. But if even half that list is real, it means that I\u2019m basically gonna be spending the rest of my life learning how to just be \u201cok\u201d. I might not even ever get there. From everything I\u2019ve heard, it takes decades at the shortest. Just thinking about spending that long, it\u2019s already exhausting me. Not to mention I\u2019m probably gonna waste all the best years of my life getting that point. What, I\u2019ll finally start to be able to live when I\u2019m 50? 60? What\u2019s the point?\n\nI can\u2019t hold down jobs, I just can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s stress or boredom or what the reason is but I just either get so depressed I self harm in the bathrooms at work and usually end up having a suicide attempt, or I get so dissociative I can\u2019t function, or I just go into a full psychotic episode. Either way\u2019s the same, I either get fired or have to quit. And my savings account just gets constantly drained by all of life\u2019s bullshit that I can never get ahead, I can never live anything but week to week. I\u2019ll never have a house or a car or any of those sorts of things because I just can\u2019t afford it. And if I could, I\u2019d have to sell it before long cause I couldn\u2019t afford the upkeep. It also means I can never afford anything but the most basic of mental health help. The only times I\u2019ve been able to visit psychiatrists, for instance, was because I had savings and I still had to starve myself for a week to offset the cost. \n\nI\u2019ll never have friends or a relationship or any of that. Not that I really care at this point, I guess, it\u2019s just a choice I have to make because I can\u2019t handle it. I\u2019ve lived without friends my entire life basically, only ever had one person I\u2019d consider a real friend and that was maybe the worst experience of my life anyway, because I fell in love with her and everything got complicated and messy and now I\u2019ve lost the friendship. That\u2019s also my only experience with love, given or received, so as much as I feel touch-starved and lonely all the time, I\u2019d rather be alone forever than risk going through any of that again. And I know that\u2019s my choice, and I think it\u2019s still better than the alternative, but god do I just get so crippling you lonely. I hug a pillow every night in bed just to feel like I have a person next to me. But I know I\u2019ll never be able to.\n\nI just don\u2019t see a way for things to get better for me. Hell, I don\u2019t even know what \u201cbetter\u201d even *looks like* for me. It\u2019s not even an episode or a depressive phase at this point, it\u2019s been years that I\u2019ve been like this. All the therapists I\u2019ve seen haven\u2019t been able to help me at all. The dozens and dozens of medications I\u2019ve been on have had zero effect whatsoever. I can\u2019t afford ECT or any of those types of specialised treatments, I\u2019ve tried psychedelics and weed and all those other \u201calternative medications\u201d that people recommended and I hate how all of them made me feel. I just don\u2019t know what else there even is to do about it, and every time I think about it, it makes me realise what my life\u2019s actually gonna be like for the next couple decades at least and I just don\u2019t wanna be here for it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ptv1u3/i_cant_think_about_even_an_hour_into_my_future/", "title": "I can\u2019t think about even an hour into my future without getting massively suicidal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MyBrainsInPain", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632402986, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ptv1u3/i_cant_think_about_even_an_hour_into_my_future/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422253.994621, "replies_charged": false}
