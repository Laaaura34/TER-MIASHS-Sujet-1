It's a short and sweet, 8-question survey based around suicide in the LGBTQ+ community that takes less than a minute to complete. I ask that anyone who is willing to, please take this survey. It is primarily geared towards those within the LGBTQ+ community, but anyone may take it. The results will go a long way in the data collection for the project and with spreading awareness of suicide within our community.\n\nDue to the sensitive nature of the subject matter, please feel free to stop the survey at any time, or to just simply not do it as well. \n\nAll results are completely anonymous.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out to me if you wish to discuss the subject at hand, any of the questions, or if you need any help with the survey.\n\nHelp is always available 24/7 to anyone in suicidal crisis or emotional distress at 1-800-273-8255.\n\n[https://surveyhero.com/c/abb77c13](https://surveyhero.com/c/abb77c13)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k425i3/academic_research_into_suicide_within_the_lgbtq/", "title": "[Academic] Research into Suicide within the LGBTQ+ Community Social Awareness Project Survey (all welcome)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KingGreenHawk", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606761774, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k425i3/academic_research_into_suicide_within_the_lgbtq/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426135.793747, "replies_charged": false}
