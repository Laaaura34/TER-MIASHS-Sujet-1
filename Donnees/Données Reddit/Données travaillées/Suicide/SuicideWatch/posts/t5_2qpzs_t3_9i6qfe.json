The realization that I\u2019ve made so many bad decisions is hitting me so hard and I\u2019m realizing that I\u2019m an absolute waste of fucking space. I don\u2019t matter at fucking all and I keep doing stupid things, just digging myself further and further down and just giving myself more reason to give up entirely. I hung out with friends today and by the end of the day I was so quiet and melancholy because my brain just had to throw a depressive episode at me while I was trying to ignore my issues by hanging out with friends. My life is a thousand times worse than it was a year ago (and I thought it was bad a year ago, I wish it was like it was a year ago now that I\u2019m dealing with this) I don\u2019t want to deal with life anymore. It\u2019s so draining and I don\u2019t like being here anymore. I don\u2019t like life. I love my family. I love my friends. I love my passions. But I myself don\u2019t deserve to enjoy those things anymore and they don\u2019t deserve to deal with a waste of space like me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9i6qfe/beyond_tired_of_life/", "title": "Beyond tired of life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tengurin", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1537688077, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9i6qfe/beyond_tired_of_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427581.3101048, "replies_charged": false}
