Inside of me is someone suffering, and who wants a way out.\n\nJust before sleep are my ideations the worst. I have no phone or device to distract me. I try playing mind games and using mental methods to quiet my internal battle, but nothing works. At night, as I lay in bed, I am forced to confront my pain. I often times break into sobbing and weeping and panic. I can't remember the last time I've gone to sleep wanting to wake up in the morning.\n\nWhen I cut my arms and slash my wrists, I distract myself from my internal emotional pain for just a moment. My thoughts are instead on the physical pain I've inflicted upon myself. Only then can I rest without turmoil.\n\nMy wrists are bloody and I've downed a handful of pills. I don't want to see tomorrow's sun. I don't want to see my story through. I'm exhausted. I'm so tired. I just want a way out.\n\nI hate myself so much. I'm tired of persisting. I'm tired of trying. I surrender. I give up.
