Everyday is torture for me because of my depression. I have been depressed for many years now and after all these years it doesn't get any easier to deal with. I know that it is selfish to just abandon friends and family but is it not selfish of them to keep me here as well? I've tried counseling, talking to friends and family, meds, and just about everything and nothing changes. You can't even openly talk to most people about suicide, it's something you have to carry with you, and for those who do try to talk will mostly not understand what it is like for you. There are plenty of us out there who have had depression for years, who have thought about suicide everyday, who have thought things through carefully and know that it is what we really want, but due to pressure from friends, family, and our society, we can't kill ourselves. What are your thoughts on this?
