In a few weeks, i\u2019m planning on running away to the US to be with the man I love, let\u2019s call him Jonathan. He\u2019s been unquestionably devoted to me since day 1, and anyone that\u2019s been in a long distance relationship knows it\u2019s difficult. He\u2019s opened up his heart and his home to me when I needed it the most. \n\nI still live with my parents, and they never listen to me when I tell them that i\u2019m not safe here (they\u2019re super homophobic, so I can\u2019t tell them why). They\u2019ve also been very abusive in the past, with my mom stabbing me at one point then threatening to kill me after she went through my phone and found out I was dating a guy when I was 16. My dad isn\u2019t much better, having threatened to beat me up and kill my cat when I told him I wanted to take her to the vet a few months ago (because she broke her leg). \n\nAt the same time, I can\u2019t help but feel an obligation to them. My parents are hopelessly in debt, and the pandemic hasn\u2019t made shit any easier on them. My mom keeps telling me that going through with this move might give my dad a heart attack or even kill him, and even if that doesn\u2019t happen, i\u2019ll be destroying him emotionally, because he needs me rn, but I can\u2019t bear to live here much longer. \n\nI can\u2019t sleep at night anymore. The choice to go would mean me living with my boyfriend, but I also have to seek asylum for being gay, and the legal path isn\u2019t an easy one. I almost jumped off the balcony last night because the choice between two shitty realities is impossible. \n\nLiving here means conforming to my parents\u2019 rules, acting straight for many years to come, risking arrest (the govt. here is cracking down on gay people) and destroying my relationship with Jonathan, the only thing keeping me afloat. If I go, I get to be free, but I also risk my dad\u2019s health, my future, and my security, as the road to asylum is long and grueling. I just want to be done with all of this.
