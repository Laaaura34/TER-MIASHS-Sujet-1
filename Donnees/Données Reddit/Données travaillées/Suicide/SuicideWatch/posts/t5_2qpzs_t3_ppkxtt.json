Just yesterday I was driving to the store listening to my favorite music, excited to have the next two days off, just feeling content. I wish everyday i could feel that way. Today, I feel so low. Like I\u2019m literally nothing to anyone. I feel like I\u2019m a horrible human being and I\u2019m never going to go anywhere with my life. I can feel myself drifting from my friends and it\u2019s entirely my fault. Sometimes i can\u2019t handle even replying to their texts. I can\u2019t even reach out to them for help because I don\u2019t want to burden them. I just want to be normal.\n\nI\u2019ve honestly never felt so alone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ppkxtt/i_am_so_tired_of_having_good_days_and_feeling/", "title": "I am so tired of having good days and feeling like things might be alright and then feeling like killing myself the literal next day.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gochaewon", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 44, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631822694, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ppkxtt/i_am_so_tired_of_having_good_days_and_feeling/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426283.1969972, "replies_charged": false}
