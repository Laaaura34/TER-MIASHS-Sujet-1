I have no friends in my country, my dad keeps on nagging me about homework, but whenever he nags me I feel this anger and anxiety and a lot of sadness. I was doing so well this week, usually, I don't even go a day without thinking of suicide but this week was nice, and now my depression and fucking suicidal thoughts are corrupting me again, I HATE MY LIFE SO MUCH. I can literally OD rn, I want to talk to a therapist but I just don't feel like they understand..... but in all honesty, I really hope everyone else is doing well!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qg77d4/i_hate_my_life_so_much/", "title": "I hate my life so much.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "leejessi", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635257288, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qg77d4/i_hate_my_life_so_much/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426877.0323014, "replies_charged": false}
