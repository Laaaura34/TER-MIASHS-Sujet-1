Thinking back I feel like my life has just been a slow downward slope since  at least middle school. I've always had trouble focusing during class and I may have ADD or something along those lines but whenever I told my parents they would always just tell me I was lazy. Flash forward a couple years and I'm not passing any of my classes, and I fucking hate my life. People around me treat me like I'm an idiot and it seriously pisses me off, but I can't exactly prove them wrong. I just want to die already and hopefully not have to deal with any of it.\nMy only safe space is my room, I completely abhor being being anywhere else. So I've spend all my free time in there. My dad is a pretty big 'gun' guy and follows the notion that there should be a fire arm in every room stashed away. I found his loaded m1 carbine last year and I've kept it under my bed ever since(which has presumably gone unoticed) just in case I want to finally kill myself. I always tell myself almost everyday \"this will be the day\", but then I inevitably pussy out if it at the last minute. I'm so tired of it, I feel like I hate everyone I've ever met and I'm just constantly unhappy.\nI want to make sure that if I shoot myself it will kill me, because I don't want to make the mistake of somehow surviving a gunshot to the head and living with whatever repercussions that might have.\nAnyways, once again sorry to make you guys read my bullshit.
