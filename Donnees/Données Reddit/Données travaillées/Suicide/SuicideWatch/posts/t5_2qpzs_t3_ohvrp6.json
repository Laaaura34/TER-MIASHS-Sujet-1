This happens to be the happiest day of my life as I always knew that between my severe bulimia and raging depression one of the two will kill me prematurely!\n\nWell I\u2019m currently rejoicing at the thought that nobody in my life actually cares what on earth happens to me so my conscience has been wiped clean in the event that something does happen to me (I.e death lol). At 21 there\u2019s so much more I wanted to achieve but quite frankly I don\u2019t see the point as nothing in my life has any meaning beyond what I assign to it & even my own life is meaningless to me.\n\nIm genuinely grateful to be here as I know in the* past few years ALOT of people\u2019s nearest and dearest haven\u2019t made it due to various reasons (don\u2019t want to mention the c-19 word). Either way the balls rolling, everything\u2019s set in stone, I never thought I\u2019d be writing a will at this stage in my life but here we are!\n\nTo all you wonderfully (fellow fragile)& beautiful humans out there, you truly deserve happiness and I hope one day you achieve it no matter how big or small (the little victories make the whole!). This is just the mindless ramblings of a distraught but liberated young adult- if you made it this far, thanks for reading & ps.
