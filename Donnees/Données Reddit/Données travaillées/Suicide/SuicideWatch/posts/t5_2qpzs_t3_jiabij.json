I\u2019m 20, in college, a rebel child, and I\u2019m suicidal. It\u2019s been tough for the past 2 years. I come from a strict immigrant family who\u2019s sole purpose was to come to the US and try and live a better life. Throughout my childhood I was considered smart and never wandered through different paths other than the perfect child role. In my last year of high-school I started drinking, smoking, and vaping. Parents eventually found out and I was punished, obviously. But I never stopped smoking, drinking, and vaping as smoking and vaping became an outlet for me and eventually an addiction. It came to the point where my parents would catch me and not even care (they don\u2019t smoke, drink, or do anything considered taboo). I\u2019ve broken their hearts, their spirits, and their visions for me. My brother was also in a phase of doing this but got past it (he\u2019s now in professional school doing pharmacy). But the thing is that he\u2019s allowed to go to a college not close to home while I\u2019m stuck at home commuting to a local uni every day of my life hating it while my parents don\u2019t allow me to hang out with friends. I make friends easily but I\u2019m stuck at home getting attached to my computer because i feel not wanted/needed. This has made me depressed for the past two years and things have only gotten worse. I\u2019ve been consistently getting worse grades in my courses and have been falling behind. It eats me up so much whenever they find out I\u2019m not doing well and it makes me even more depressed and it\u2019s like a cycle. I\u2019ve been wanting to end it all for weeks now but I\u2019m too cowardly to do it in a manner that\u2019s obvious as it\u2019d hurt my family. I want to make it look like an accident (car crash or something). Every time I\u2019m out for groceries or any quick run I always think about slightly veering into an oncoming 18 wheeler to just end it all. Tonight I write this message because I almost went through hanging myself because of the thoughts I\u2019ve been having. I don\u2019t take any medications, or go to a therapist as my parents think that doing this will ruin my whole career (if I ever get one). I don\u2019t know what to do and i need guidance or else it\u2019ll all end soon.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jiabij/idk_what_to_do/", "title": "Idk what to do", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwawayyyy278", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603697544, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jiabij/idk_what_to_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428483.3011599, "replies_charged": false}
