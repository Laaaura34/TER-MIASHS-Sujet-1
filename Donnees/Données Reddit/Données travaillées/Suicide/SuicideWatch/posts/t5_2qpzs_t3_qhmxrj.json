I\u2019m not here to get pity and I\u2019m not here to  get encouragement. Don\u2019t say ur 16 so young bright future dont do it.  I\u2019m simply here to rant.\n\nI hate myself and my life, every bit. Now i wont say why i want to off myself, there were so many factors that\u2019s started small and everything just built up. I\u2019m 16, the only reason why I haven\u2019t offed myself is 2 things. My families mental health. I guess just one, that\u2019s really all. Ive really been looking for that push u know, like that push like one last straw that would make me finally commit.  It came, 10 minutes ago. I wont get into details but, my future is crushed. I don\u2019t see myself living really, the past year I\u2019ve been holed up in my room and I\u2019ve become human waste. My sister likes to say I\u2019ve given up on myself and to be fair i did. Haha. Won\u2019t even try to deny that when Im normally such a defensive person.\n\n\nI guess karma came for me. I bullied kids in school and done a ton of horrible things and I\u2019ve only lived 16 years.  Ive disappointed many. Now so far and I\u2019ve counted, its been since the end of 2019 that i first had suicidal thoughts. Hasn\u2019t been a day since that I haven\u2019t thought about it. I\u2019m a guy, and i come from a fairly conservative place. We don\u2019t share a lot around here. Ive never talked to anyone about my problems and frankly i do not want to. I needed a fresh start away from reality and this urban hellhole i live in. That fresh start has been stripped, no bueno! Call me selfish, i really dont care. I\u2019m still finding ways to off myself. You know the most frustrating part is there isnt much on the internet. Mention anything that comes close to suicide and I\u2019m bombed with fucking hotlines. It\u2019s so hard to get drugs to OD here too. OD has always been my plan, painless, euphoric. I cant jump off a abuilding because i live on the third floor in a house. When i finally find a painlkes Ay to off myself, i really think ill do it. I used to be scared of the pain, not anymore. I donthave that drop in my stomach when i think about offing myself anymore. In fact I\u2019m excited to become nothing.like before i was born i was nothing, i cant wait to be nothing again.
