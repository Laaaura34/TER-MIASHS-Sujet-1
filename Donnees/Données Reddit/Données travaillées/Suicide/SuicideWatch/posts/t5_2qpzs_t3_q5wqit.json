The depression and anxiety never stop. I\u2019m sad and lonely. I\u2019m single and just want to meet my person and I date jerks. I feel so alone and that no one gets me. I\u2019m pretty smart, I have a masters in social work, and I should be able to help myself but I can\u2019t. I just want it to end. I can\u2019t do this anymore. \n\nAll my friends have partners, all of my friends that want kids have them, or the single ones I have are leaving. All my exes moved on to other people or in general. I\u2019m so fucking alone and I know I don\u2019t deserve to be. \n\nI\u2019m so depressed. Everything is heavy. Everything is hard. I feel hopeless and helpless. \n\nWhy am I so fucked up? Why won\u2019t it end? Why doesn\u2019t the medicine help? What\u2019s wrong with me? I can\u2019t take it anymore. It hurts. \n\nThe only consistent thing in my life is my dad and my therapist who I\u2019ve had for 6 years. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t the fucking medication work? Why doesn\u2019t my brain work? Why am I so broken?\n\nWhy?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5wqit/nonstop_suicidal_ideation/", "title": "Non-stop suicidal ideation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ois4Orvy", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633961551, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5wqit/nonstop_suicidal_ideation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427198.3532991, "replies_charged": false}
