I feel like I'm losing control over everything and myself. I'm lashing out and so full of rage and hurt because of what's been done to me and the way I've been treated by so many people, including people who I thought were friends but haven't reached out to me at all during this time, even though I've given so much support and encouragement to them over the years.\n\nI'm lashing out badly at some who is the closest to me. I know I'm pushing him away but I can't seem to help myself. I am genuinely hurt by some things but I just don't feel like I have anything else to lose and am starting to destroy everything even though it's the last thing I want.\n\nI know there'll be people here and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about and how I feel. It's a comfort to know I'm here with people who won't judge me and may even be able to offer some advice.\n\nThanks to anybody who reads this and anyone who replies. I didn't know what else to do tonight.
