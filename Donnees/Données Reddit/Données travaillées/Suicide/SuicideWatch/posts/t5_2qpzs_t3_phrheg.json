My lack of motivation causes lack of hygiene, at best I shower once a week. My OCD and insomnia are probably the worst parts. I'm convinced I was only made by God just so he could test torturing on me. Everything is cold and dirty, no warmth or purity for me. If things don't get better till my 16th birthday I'm just going to end it. I mean what's the point of being alive if you hate every second of it.
