I learned about sex assignment surgery when I was 6, since then I wanted nothing more but to harm and kill myself.\n\nSometimes, I got up, went to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and pointed it against my stomach. Never did it, instinct of self-preservation is tough to beat, even for a child.\n\nI never felt happy or alive. I never had any friends and the people I can call family, I never had myself. Society despises me, there is no point in crying for help.\n\nI have goals and a dream, but I get punished every time I try to accomplish these goals. I know that my dream will never come true.\n\nI am the loneliest girl in the world, nobody will never understand or want me. I can't even die the way I want to. I can't escape, I'm trapped.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pkvdyq/is_it_really_so_horrible_for_someone_like_me_to/", "title": "Is it really so horrible for someone like me to kill herself, if I was never alive in the first place?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RottenGirl12", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 175, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631184402, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pkvdyq/is_it_really_so_horrible_for_someone_like_me_to/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635425322.2320604, "replies_charged": false}
