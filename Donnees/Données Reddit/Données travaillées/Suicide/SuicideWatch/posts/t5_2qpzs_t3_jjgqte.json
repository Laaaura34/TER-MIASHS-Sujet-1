I\u2019m 16 and trans non-binary.  \nI came out to my parents and they didn\u2019t take it too well. To my face they said they supported me but I have messages showing the exact opposite.  \nThey say they accept me yet they refuse to use my pronouns. My mother laughed at my name and said she\u2019d never have a child named after an animal.  \nI\u2019m told that I\u2019m too young to know what I want. Too young to know that I want top surgery. That I\u2019m not having kids. Yet I\u2019m old enough to be told that I should be acting like an adult. Old enough that I should be able to decide what I want to do for the rest of my life. But not old enough that I can decide what I want my body to look like.  \nThey don\u2019t accept me.  \n\nI can\u2019t live with this anymore. Dysphoria is slowly killing me. I get no support at home. I don\u2019t have friends - and when I say that I mean it. I moved recently and have not talked to another teenager.  \nSo there. I\u2019m giving up. Add me on to the transgender suicide statistic.
