I attend Eating Recovery Center(ERC)- Insight Chicago and I've been there in the BETTR PROGRAM , program designed for BED. I have Binge Eating Disorder with a purging component. I don't want to have this , I'm so tired , it's been 10 years of this suffering , I can't have long lasting relationships or friendships. I'm a woman with autistic traits , bipolar and borderline personality disorder. I don't know which started which, but this disorder is killing me and I don't want to have this. I'm exhausted of getting dizzy, of the headaches , of the anxiety, of the messed up smells. My last purge was a couple days ago and I got very close to a heart attack. I'm 23 about to be 24 , I'm a senior in mechanical engineering. I already lost a semester in medical leave treating my eating disorder and here I am , at a collapse. After this stay and the ER, the eating recovery center will transfer me to their residential facility. It's summer , I don't have friends, but I like the sun. I'm just exhausted , I have no strength. I thought it will get better. I'm so tired and it's so painful to spend my birthday alone in the ER.\nMy place for suicide was to take pills. I have done it before and ended up in the ER and it didn't work as I thought it would. I'm tired of living like this. How much suffering is enough for others to understand I want to rest.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8lp17w/im_spending_my_24th_birthday_in_the_er/", "title": "I'm spending my 24th birthday in the ER involuntarily checked by my Eating disorder facility due to suicidal behavior and strong eating disorder symptoms", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rocketEarthWindfire", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1527127604, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8lp17w/im_spending_my_24th_birthday_in_the_er/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425243.5851295, "replies_charged": false}
