I am at the stage where my mind is my worse enemy and it\u2019s just a matter of time. I have already made the decision to do it. I know I will but I don\u2019t know when. I am drawn to the sea. I look over a bridge and feel compelled to jump in the water, i go to beach and feel the urge to walk in the water. Nature in general I see a mountain and I just want to go to that location to kill myself. It\u2019s so weird it\u2019s a feeling I can\u2019t describe I just  feel drawn to natural ways that will kill me. It\u2019s weird maybe it\u2019s my body telling me it\u2019s time to go I don\u2019t know. I mean we are related to nature so maybe that why.
