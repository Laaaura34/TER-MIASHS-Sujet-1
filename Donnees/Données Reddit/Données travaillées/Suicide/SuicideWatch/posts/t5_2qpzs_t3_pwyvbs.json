For a very long time I tried to deny it, and tried to be more and more feminine until my 18th birthday. I cut off all my hair (I\u2019d previously refused to because I believed I would \u2018realize something\u2019 which is dumb as hell in hindsight) and came out officially. \n\nI started testosterone right before the pandemic, and being high risk made it so I could not do much but focus on my transition. However, testosterone didn\u2019t work well for me \u2014 I have a medical issue with my throat (hence the high risk) and my voice wasn\u2019t physically capable of dropping. There were certain things that did change but overall I was still perceived as feminine, no matter how hard I tried \u2014 I still am perceived as feminine. I\u2019m unable to pay for the surgery to get rid of my chest on my own and I\u2019m unable to work long hours due to disabilities. \n\nI hate my body. I hate it so much I want to puke every day. I\u2019ve given up trying to change it, I\u2019ve given up completely. A few days ago I had to go to the doctor to get a check up and she recommended a Pap smear since I turned 21 and I started bawling in the office before throwing up when I got home. I don\u2019t know what to do to fix it because I\u2019m never gonna be the person I want to be \u2014 I\u2019m never gonna be seen as male. Everything I do is too feminine. I stopped working out and I stopped searching for doctors because I\u2019m tired. I just want to die. I want to die and be reborn in the right body. There\u2019s no surgery that can make me taller, there\u2019s no surgery that can make me have a penis that\u2019s not somewhat off, there\u2019s no surgery that can replace the 18 years I lived previously as female. I hate myself so much. The only reason I\u2019m alive is because I don\u2019t want to hurt my mom, but I\u2019m planning on moving out soon. I want to kill myself when I do that, because then she wouldn\u2019t be the one to find me. \n\nThis is the first time I\u2019m writing this out so I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s in cohesive. I\u2019m so fucking tired. I\u2019m literally writing this on my porn account because this was entirely triggered by being Horny and realizing I\u2019m missing the right parts all over again. I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re reading this because it\u2019s all fucking dumb and doesn\u2019t make sense", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwyvbs/i_will_never_be_the_person_i_want_to_be_and_ive/", "title": "I will never be the person I want to be and I\u2019ve given up.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "yet_another_twink", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632804395, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwyvbs/i_will_never_be_the_person_i_want_to_be_and_ive/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635427970.2896445, "replies_charged": false}
