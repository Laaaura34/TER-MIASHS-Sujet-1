As you can see - I am still kicking, despite everything you might read in my comment history. I am sad to say that I've attempted suicide 3 times since then, once by self-suffocation, once by cutting my wrists and neck, and once by pills. Today I've attempted to kill myself again through insane dosage of stimulants mixed with anti-psychotics, anti-depressants and benzodiazepines. My psychotherapist is saying that he can't do anything about this night-time melancholy untill I start taking one more expensive anti-psychotic medicine. We've since discovered a sexual childhood trauma and I've had an additional diagnosis of bipolar disorder. I felt like passing out, but right now I am coherent enough to write this and ask for help. I don't know for what help am I asking, but please, if you're reading this, at least tell me that it is possible for things to get better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jrrke8/hello_again/", "title": "Hello again", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Tm9Ib3Bl", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605036247, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jrrke8/hello_again/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427520.0344367, "replies_charged": false}
