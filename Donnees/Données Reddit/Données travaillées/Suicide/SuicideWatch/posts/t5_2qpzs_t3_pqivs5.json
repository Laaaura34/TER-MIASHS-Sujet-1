I have told one or two people about how I'm feeling, they chatted for a bit but I haven't heard from them for a few days. I know it seems selfish to wonder but I do wonder if I cross their minds at all. In the time they haven't messaged I could have done something about it. But I havent. I got into an argument with my mom the other day and told her I didn't want to be here anymore. She was drunk so I don't think she would remember. Either that or she doesn't want to talk about it. I'm not sure how I feel, I've spent the last few days feeling so low thinking about things that I could do but now I feel nothing. Maybe a few of you feel something similar? I know there's a part of me that doesn't want to die but I just want the pain to stop. It's all I ever think about.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqivs5/thinking_too_much/", "title": "Thinking too much", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lozzathebumblebee", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631954970, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqivs5/thinking_too_much/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426836.277742, "replies_charged": false}
