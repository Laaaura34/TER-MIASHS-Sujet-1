I have insomnia that prevents me from sleeping more than 0-3 hours a night. Every night, I do an OCD routine of moving things around, flushing the toilet, flickering lights, pushing on my bed, pulling curtains, and digging nails into my skin for at least 5 hours a night before I can even THINK about trying to sleep. It results in anxiety, frustration, physical pain, and inability to sleep due to being so damn angry and raising my heart rate. This is not an exaggeration. I do these things for at least 5 hours every single night. On top of that, I have existential OCD that causes me to constantly think ridiculous and repetitive thoughts about existence. It is driving me insane. It is going to be the literal death of me.\n\nI have lost my identity and my will to live. I have grown resentful of myself and other humans. Quite frankly, the only reason I have not killed myself is because of my SO still caring about me. I do not have a family. They disowned me long ago. I have dropped out of school and cannot hold a job due to my crippling mental illness. I live in a state that has not expanded Medicaid for poor adults and have no way of getting help. I live in rural no where and anxiety prevents me from learning to drive. When I say that there is no way for me to get help, I mean that sincerely. I have considered every option and happen to live in a shitty state that doesn't want poor adults to get health care for free. (NC). \n\nI have been depressed since I was a small child, following abuse and neglect and incest from family. I have been raped twice and I am so mentally unstable that it physically hurts me to exist.\n\nI should have the right to die a peaceful death. I did not consent to existence. I do not want to be here. When did my body stop becoming my body? I want to die. I don't want advice or sympathy or even criticism. I want to die. And I want to know why I can't. why can't I just walk into a clinic, tell them my story, and asked to d euthanasized. They force me to suffer and if I so much as hint at suicide, I'm throw into a mental hospital where they abuse me. (Happened once when I was 14). \n\nLet me die. I am miserable. I am suffering. I have been suffering. No, it won't get better. No, I don't want to try anymore. I want it to end. I want you to acknowledge my pain, acknowledge the situation is futile and give me validation that I am allowed to die. \n\nHuman beings should not be forced to live in poverty and mental illness with no possibility of help. I am a fucking human being who is suffering due to an unjust society and government. But I'm over that now. So far over it. I don't care anymore. I want to die. If my SO (who is abusive half the time) would make some friends and leave me the fuck alone (there's a reason I'm aggressive about him, he's physically hurt me), maybe I could do it. If he would just go and stay gone, I'll do it. I'll be free. I'll catch the bus and go forever. There is nothing and no one here for me.\n\nNo. I have no friends. No family. No coworkers. No neighbors. No pets. No, no one will miss me when I am gone. So why...WHY must I suffer? Fucking tell me why my life is nonstop suffering and hell and I can't even SLEEP? Tell me why you think it's ok to allow another human to go through this mental torture just so you don't feel sad or whatever it is you feel.\n\nLet me go.
