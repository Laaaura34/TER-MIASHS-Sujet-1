It's described in the bible in the story of Cain an Abel, Cain gets resentful because his sacrifices are being rejected by god. I've been having physical visible symptoms of someone who drinks alcohol everyday. I am only 18, never really had alcohol. Doctors don't tell me what it is, maybe genetics, my grandpa lives in extreme poverty, all his life was spent in alcohol. I see my friends partying and not taking care of themselves and it's frustrating, i have been dealing with psychological help. Just wanted to share this.
