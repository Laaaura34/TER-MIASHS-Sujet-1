He\u2019s 18, facing a couple felony counts. Not the crime of the century but he thought he would get away with just a ticket or something like that. Just the other day he tried to overdose on painkillers. \nMy girlfriend (who is also very good friends with him) lives next door to him and her mom is a police officer. Fortunately, she was home when it happened and she was able to go next door and do CPR, as she has done this many times being a police officer responding to overdoses. He just got released from the hospital today and come to find out he\u2019s extremely mad at her for saving his life. \nHe overdosed on purpose. He just got a second chance at life and he\u2019s mad that he didn\u2019t die. I have no idea what to say or what to do. Feeling hopeless right now and I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to be successful next time he attempts to kill himself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pnpwyw/how_to_help_out_a_friend_who_just_survived_a/", "title": "How to help out a friend who just survived a suicide attempt and is mad he didn\u2019t die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "slicklex", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631571919, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pnpwyw/how_to_help_out_a_friend_who_just_survived_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428530.3840644, "replies_charged": false}
