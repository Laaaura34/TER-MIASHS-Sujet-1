Living with my parents is a nightmare they don't understand my issues and refuse to understand my frustration in life just make it worse for me plus they don't seem to get along as well as other parents; shitty marriage that should have ended before I was born. No love in my life like many others around me. I'm young right now and that's the only thing keeping me alive but my mind has gotten to a stage where I am almost at a point of no return; certain suicide within the next 5-10 years. Explain to me why dying is even a bad thing? This world is not working out for me I have too many issues I probably can't deal with why can't I just die why is it such a big deal? Worst comes to worst I might just kill myself within the next year or two who knows.\n\nIdk if anyone will respond who the fuck knows.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ppyp8m/no_outlook_i_will_die_fuck_humanity_shit_place/", "title": "No outlook I will die fuck humanity shit place", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gwangamoon", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631879637, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ppyp8m/no_outlook_i_will_die_fuck_humanity_shit_place/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423134.7798657, "replies_charged": false}
