There was a miscommunication with the landlord, and now I am far behind on rent, I hate my job, and it doesn't pay enough for me to get out of this hole anyway. Thinking of spending my next check on a gat and just finishing it. That way my family might get at least a couple hundred bucks when i'm gone. I just don't see the point in going broke and ending up on the street. I'll never recover. Im fucked.
