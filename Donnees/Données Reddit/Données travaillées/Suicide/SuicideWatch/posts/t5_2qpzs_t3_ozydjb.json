I know that she was afraid of all drugsas her mom had overdosed when she was little -she told me i was a joke if i toked :,) - and i feel like i abused the fact she looked up to me by re-introducing her to the vices that led to her death. When i got her into them i didnt know shed already had that happen so i kind of mocked her fear. after that she just spiraled into that scene and i feel so guilty. She passed on the second of january anf i know that it should have been me. She also passed 3 months before her birthday, and as it nears mine i feel myself getting worse and worse because i dont want to get older than her. I shouldnt have enabled and encouraged those behaviors and i feel lke it should have been me. She deserved so much more than what she ended up getting", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ozydjb/survivors_guilt_tw_pills/", "title": "survivors guilt tw pills", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "luvoxlolita", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628360183, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ozydjb/survivors_guilt_tw_pills/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426180.1290336, "replies_charged": false}
