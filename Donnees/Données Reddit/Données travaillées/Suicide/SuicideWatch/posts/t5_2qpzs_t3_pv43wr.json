I\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts for a couple years now and every time I have them it always makes me feel relieved. Almost like if anything happens I always have a way out. I have thought of many ways of doing it and decided on one method already but I never went as far as to write a note or get up and prepare to do it. Is there anyone out there with similar symptoms as me? It really does scare me to have these thoughts, I have a one year old daughter and a husband I love very much. It breaks my heart to think of them missing me, but sometimes I forget about their feelings and indulge on the idea of an escape from my life. I feel so selfish. I just don\u2019t know how much more I can take.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pv43wr/suicidal_thoughts_makes_me_feel_relieved/", "title": "Suicidal thoughts makes me feel relieved?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "milkymommybob", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632565251, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pv43wr/suicidal_thoughts_makes_me_feel_relieved/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635427377.133559, "replies_charged": false}
