I have used my friends kindness and hurt them mentally in return. I have currently no friends i have them all hate me. I don't blame them i am actually a horrible fucking person.\n\nI feel so bad for my parents, they didn't deserve such a trash son. My parents are such great people and all i give them in return is agony. I wish i could give them an actually good person to replace me.\n\nFailed multiple relationships, why would anyone love a mess as me. In every relationship it was my own fucking fault. Like why choose me, It's like going for a level 1 when you can get a lvl60.\n\nDon't give me the \"everything is going to be better\" \"just work on it\" i know it's not possible for me to live a happy life.\nIt feels i need to die, as it is my duty. The last thing i can do that is right. \nFor some reason it's so difficult to kill myself. What is holding me? My future is as dark as it can be.\nIf anyone knows how to make it easier that would be amazing.\n\nI don't even know why i am writing this. Is it for attention? I do not know.\n\nApologies for my terrible English.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5fuqd/i_deserve_to_die_i_am_a_failure/", "title": "I deserve to die, i am a failure", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Hamvy", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633897096, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5fuqd/i_deserve_to_die_i_am_a_failure/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426903.0444858, "replies_charged": false}
