The one man who truly saved my life died not so long ago from cancer I will forever be in debt to him. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I made a note describing why I died but I can\u2019t deal with the chain of suicides that will follow(a friend and I are in a suicide pact) I want to know what people think I should do to get out of this rut I\u2019m in. I\u2019m worried because my psychotic tendencies are coming back as well as my schizophrenia.
