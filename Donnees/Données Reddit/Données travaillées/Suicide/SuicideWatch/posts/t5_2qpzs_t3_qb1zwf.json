I go to parties and get drunk surrounded by genuine friends. I have a family that loves me and supports me dearly. And yet I can stop thinking about how pointless it all is. I have a hard time enjoying things that I used to enjoy. I spend long nights wallowing in self hatred and pity when there's nothing to pity in the first place. Why am I like this. Why do I wish I were someone else so bad. I want to forward this with that I'm not going to kill myself. I've come to accept that I represent too much of an investment and would hurt those around me far too much for it to be worth it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qb1zwf/my_life_is_great_but_i_want_to_die/", "title": "My life is great but I want to die.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "seasonaldysphoria", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634610809, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qb1zwf/my_life_is_great_but_i_want_to_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423130.9057307, "replies_charged": false}
