They say my life is not mine to take. They say it's my parents. How stupid is that? This life is the shittiest thing given to me. And I should live it and cherish it to make my parents happy? \n\nWhat about me, my feelings, my problems? They had a shitty life. Idk how they thought passing that to me will help them. What kind of sick people will create life to solve their problems? And why people accept it? They say that they sacrificed their life for me. But tbh, my life is the sacrifice for their relationship, social status, purpose, etc. And they'd have me dying daily than dying once. That way they could have the things I mentioned. \n\nNothing is sicker than bringing life into the world even after knowing how hard and painful it is and/ or it could get. \n\nFuck you, parents.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nm293v/dont_commit_suicide_thatll_hurt_us_die_daily_and/", "title": "Don't commit suicide.
