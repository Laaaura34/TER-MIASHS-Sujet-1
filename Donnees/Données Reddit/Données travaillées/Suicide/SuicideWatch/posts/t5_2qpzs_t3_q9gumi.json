Living in an asian household I can't open up about my mental health as it is seen as a taboo and is usually associated with being crazy.\n\n\nJust a few moments ago my mom got mad at me for not locking the door since thieves just broke in a house in our area, I do understand her concerns and all and I really thought that I locked that door but i probably didn't checked if I did lock it properly. That being said I just stood there and listened to her then she got a bit physical like always and started to hit my head once and pull my hair while scolding me I did wish that it did get physical as it was much better than the words that she called me ( you don't have a brain, if your planning to put yourself in danger don't even think about implicating us, if something bad happens to you while your boarding just die I don't want you crying here in my feet, and etc) I don't know what to do and im feeling very numb right now, i feel like i just want to end it all because that would probably make everyone's lives much better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9gumi/i_f18_dont_even_know_where_to_begin_with_and_i/", "title": "I F18 don't even know where to begin with and I don't have anyone to tell too since I don't wanna burden my friends.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ColdGoddess16", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634406441, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9gumi/i_f18_dont_even_know_where_to_begin_with_and_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425563.393681, "replies_charged": false}
