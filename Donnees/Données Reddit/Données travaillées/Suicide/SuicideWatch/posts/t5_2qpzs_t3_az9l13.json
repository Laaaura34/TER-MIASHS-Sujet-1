I have no family no beliefs. Not even a friend who would cry after me when I left. I\u2019ve always loved Edgar Allan Poe as a writer. In his poem \u201cRomance\u201d he says; And so being young and dipped in folly, I fell in love with melancholy.\u201d I\u2019m 20 next month had 1 girlfriend my entire life. Still a virgin. I walk around with a 12\u201d Mohawk and a denim vest with razorblades on its collars. Sometimes I just want to rip those blades off and stick them inside me. I don\u2019t know. Should I go or should I not. I still don\u2019t know.
