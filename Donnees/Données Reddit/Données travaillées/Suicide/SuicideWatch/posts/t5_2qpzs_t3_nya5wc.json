My toxic ex-husband is ruining my life, and I seem to have no escape. Im also facing other long-term problems. I don't have any hope for the future anymore, and although I could strive to be happy and live the life I want, I don't even want to take the risk.   As I don't have access to a firearm and jumping out of a terrace/slitting my wrists are ineffective in my opinion, I've decided I want to overdose.  I have access to Klonopin, Xanax, and I could eventually buy Ativan or roofies safely and legally. Benadryl and alcohol are also easy to get. What I'd like to know is how much of these substances and in what order will put me out of my misery. Provided that I'm alone and left unattended.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nya5wc/suicidal_ideations_i_dont_want_to_live_like_this/", "title": "Suicidal ideations...
