But I guess I miss some sort of platform and reddit seems to fit what I'm looking for. I'm not familiar with the rules so I hope I don't trigger anybody.\n\nSo,\n\nI attempted suicide last Saturday. It was the second time. The first time was about 3 years ago. I'm 24 now. \n\nI'm not seeing a therapist (I used to but stopped because of covid) but am seeing a psychiatrist. I don't feel like he fully understands me and after the last session I believe he isn't right for me. \n\nI'm not even sure I got the right diagnosis and I fear I'm not taking the right medication. \n\nIt's weird reading stranger's posts about their struggles. It's so similar to what I go through. I wish we could all have the support we need. We deserve all the chances we can get.\n\nI'm sorry this post isn't going anywhere. \n\nHope you all stay safe.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oy471g/days_after_my_suicide_attempt/", "title": "Days after my suicide attempt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bettertriz", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 72, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628116761, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oy471g/days_after_my_suicide_attempt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428518.086165, "replies_charged": false}
