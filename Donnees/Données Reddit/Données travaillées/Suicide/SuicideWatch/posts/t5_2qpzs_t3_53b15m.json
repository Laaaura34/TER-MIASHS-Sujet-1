I am seeking inspiration for my own life, and would like to hear your thoughts on this. Also, does anyone have any suggestions for what one could do during an acute suicidal crisis? Something to think about maybe? I have heard \"call a hotline\", \"talk to someone you trust\", and \"distance thoughts from actions/wait 24 hours\" many times.
