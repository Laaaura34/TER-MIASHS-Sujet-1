I won\u2019t go into it so as to not trigger anybody. I haven\u2019t been triggered by things since I was a kid. Generally I analyze every single thing all the time (might be an OCD characteristic). And usually if I\u2019m anxious ab something I ruminate until it becomes \u201cold\u201d or I have a new conclusion. But this story legitimately terrified me bc...I related so much to the person. Like, way too much. Not just in the mental illness aspect, but in their analytical manner of thinking and even their demographics. I\u2019ve been trying for so long to hold on, but when I read this article, for the first time in my entire life I felt truly hopeless. I\u2019m scared that I shouldn\u2019t hang on anymore because it CANT get better, no matter how much I hope that it will. I always want to help people and improve the world but I don\u2019t know how anybody would be able to help me. I truly feel powerless. And ive written things on social media in the past to raise awareness for social justice, as well as to share my open thoughts ab some intriguing topic. But I can\u2019t do it about this because it would freak people out. It\u2019s freaking me out and I\u2019m the one who understands it. I want help and I want to feel okay but I don\u2019t know if it is possible anymore. And I don\u2019t know how I will \u201cconclude\u201d something about that article anytime soon, if at all. and the truth is that I think it\u2019s going to stay with me for awhile", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n9jut9/terrified/", "title": "terrified", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "marie_purr", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620691138, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n9jut9/terrified/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428041.2945454, "replies_charged": false}
