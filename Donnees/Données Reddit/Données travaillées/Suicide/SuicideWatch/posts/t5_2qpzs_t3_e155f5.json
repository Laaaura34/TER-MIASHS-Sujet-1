But the thing is, is that it *does* work. I\u2019m happy, my behavior is more controlled, it helps with my bulimia, I hate myself less, and I have a more rational mindset\u2014 I hate it.\n\nThis is not what I\u2019m used to and it\u2019s making me feel suicidal because of it. I\u2019m back to cutting again, it\u2019s not as bad as it was because I refrain from cutting deep and going all out on my arm, I don\u2019t cut everyday anymore either. And I fucking miss it. I don\u2019t like these new feelings, I don\u2019t like my bulimia being controlled. I want to go back to my bad habits but my mindset is refusing to do so. I\u2019ve been crying so much lately because of it and I\u2019m just tired.\n\nIs anyone able to tell me what\u2019s going on with me?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e155f5/im_too_happy_and_its_making_me_depressed/", "title": "I\u2019m too happy and it\u2019s making me depressed.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "razor-blaades", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1574631385, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e155f5/im_too_happy_and_its_making_me_depressed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422955.7682433, "replies_charged": false}
