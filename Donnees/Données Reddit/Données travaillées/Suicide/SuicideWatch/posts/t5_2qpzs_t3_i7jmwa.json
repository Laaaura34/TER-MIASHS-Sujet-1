That deep pit feeling of feeling your whole world crashing around you and not being able to do anything to help. I don\u2019t answer anyone anymore, i can\u2019t bring myself to do anytime new. It\u2019s just like, what\u2019s the point if i know i\u2019ll be dead soon ya know? I can\u2019t bring myself to overdose, logically I don\u2019t think the chances are worth it, something like 1% chance of dying from it. Nope. I\u2019ve always liked doing things where the outcome i prefer is very probable. Soooo i can only think of one method where I would most likely be successful but it\u2019s difficult. Sometimes when i\u2019m driving I just think about swerving into the middle of traffic and ending it right there. Maybe then i\u2019d feel something.\n\nI don\u2019t really know where i went wrong. I try to pinpoint certain things in my life that happened that affected me greatly but there\u2019s so much that I can\u2019t even tell when and what made me start feeling this way, it\u2019s just been so fucking long. I\u2019m only 20. There\u2019s so much life ahead of me but I can\u2019t see the light. When i was a kid i used to want to fast forward to this age and be studying to become a lawyer so I could be living in a mansion with a big family. I had such big aspirations. Now i have nothing. I miss who i used to be and i don\u2019t think i can ever become someone that could compare to that fearless, outgoing, inspiring, motivated girl I once was who had the world at her fingertips, all while being close friends with literally everyone I knew. I just don\u2019t know how I went from being everything to being nothing. I think about death all day everyday. I yearn to feel eternal peace. My soul is fucking crying !!!!!\n\nSorry i went all over the place.
