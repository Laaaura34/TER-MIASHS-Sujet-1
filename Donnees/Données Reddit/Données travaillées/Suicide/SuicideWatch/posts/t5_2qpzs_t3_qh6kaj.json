I'm only 13 and can't risk the cops coming here and my parents finding out i self-harm and is suicidal. I have a counsellor but i haven't been able to talk to him in a month bc my parents took away my phone for personal reasons and they won't make another session with him. Are the cops gonna come if i told them i almost tried killing myself a few days ago or something? What do i say or shouldn't say??", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qh6kaj/will_the_suicide_hotline_call_the_cops/", "title": "Will the suicide hotline call the cops?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "0nyxB", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635368654, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qh6kaj/will_the_suicide_hotline_call_the_cops/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635421082.8498793, "replies_charged": false}
