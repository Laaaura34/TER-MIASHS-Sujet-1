It's been pretty bad and I've had attempts in the past. For the past few weeks or so I've been doing better in terms of my depression but the suicidal thoughts are still there. I'm happy but still thinking about suicide. What's weird is the more I think about my own suicide the happier I get. It's weird but also dangerous. Before suicide was a last resort type thing but now it's more like something I look forward to.
