I\u2019ve tried nearly every therapeutic approach, medication, and neuromodulation treatment available. I hate myself, and I hate watching the world pass me by while I remain fixated on my self-created misery and continue to self-sabotage day after day. I know I am the problem and am standing in my own way. I truly feel life is meaningless.  \n\nThe way I am living my life is killing me. Driving myself into the ground with perfectionism. Putting so much pressure on myself to be perfect, I can't breathe. Constant rigidity. I'm miserable day-to-day, striving for unattainable ideals of happiness and success. Peace and placidity evade me. How can I change everything I am? My very being. Everything that led me to this point - the \"standards,\" the self-discipline, the restricting - threatens to take it all away, as paralysis proceeds stagnation. I hide behind these ideals terrified of failure, of falling short of greatness. I can't breathe, the walls are closing in, and I have to face how flawed I am. I want to be someone else, but I so desperately want to be the perfect version of me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kz03pu/i_truly_feel_life_is_meaningless/", "title": "I truly feel life is meaningless.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gr8mile", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610860554, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kz03pu/i_truly_feel_life_is_meaningless/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428144.2676837, "replies_charged": false}
