I have gained weight because of my eating disorder and it's tearing me up inside. It's not really about the weight though. It's the fact that I'm so chained to food. My life revolves around it and I hate it. I keep trying to get better but I slip up and spiral and I don't know what to do anymore. No one views it as a problem and no one sees how much I'm hurting because im a healthy weight. The fact that I'm a fucking tranny doesn't help. I'm such a joke. It's weird though, because socially I am doing so well. I have so much fun with my friends. But I'm struggling so much with school and myself and my bulimia. It's eating away at my desire to keep trying. I just want to escape from it all. I truly don't know how to move forward", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bjbjnf/i_feel_like_a_prisoner_in_my_own_body/", "title": "I feel like a prisoner in my own body", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "itsamhquest", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1556674402, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bjbjnf/i_feel_like_a_prisoner_in_my_own_body/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422955.9943202, "replies_charged": false}
