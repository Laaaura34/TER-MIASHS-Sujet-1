They just want them to do it where nobody looks. In solitude and in silence. With shame, almost. Or surely.\n\nNobody cares whether you stay alive or not. Nobody cares if you are going to kill yourself or not. They only care about the impact it'll have on other people.\n\nIf your death won't hurt anyone, if no one will mourn you; if you do it nice and clean, without disturbing anyone... No one cares.\n\nSuch violent, traumatising ways of taking one's life wouldn't be a thing if one had access to assisted suicide, or any other way to get a painless and quick death - at least, as painless and quick as it can be.\n\nYet society appears not to be ready to give us this possibility. So for now we'll just keep on jumping onto tracks, making a mess and traumatising people.\n\nAinsi soit-il.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/okinrn/suicide_by_train/", "title": "Suicide by train", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "StolenOrgans", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626313207, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/okinrn/suicide_by_train/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426773.5000436, "replies_charged": false}
