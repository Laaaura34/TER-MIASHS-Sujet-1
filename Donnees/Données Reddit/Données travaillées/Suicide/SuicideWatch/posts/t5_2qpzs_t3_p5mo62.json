First, I began living with my grandmother and sister. Then finally, my mother was able to secure a stable and permanent living situation in in a new school district. I don't want to say the location but I'll just say it is similar to a school district in a place like Greenwhich, Potomac, Scarsdale, or Haddonfield. Hopefully you get the picture. I was so excited because even though I was going to be a new student, I knew my mom was staying in the district and I was not going to have to leave any of the friends I made. I had no idea how miserable the next few years were going to be. As an 8th grader, my very first year was nothing short of hell. The students were fairly friendly, but I still ran into mean girls and asshole guys. During that year, no one bullied me or targeted me that often, but it was just a very depressing time because i was excluded from things... a lot. I knew that I was black but that was the very first time that I felt like an \"other\". I knew felt so low about myself from all the exclusion and differential treatment.  I blamed a lot of the social isolation on the fact that I was a new student and not yet acclimated to the environment but I never got invited when people would hangout or to their dinners or parties. And there were a lot of them. People openly talked about weekend plans and the things they were doing with their friends right in front of me. I still remember spending spring break at my grandmother's house while all my peers went on their vacations or to their beach houses. During the fourth and final quarter of that school year, I was probably coming home and crying every single day. That was the very first time I felt 'depressed'. I had obviously cried before, but it had never reached a point where I was crying every single day, sometimes even before school. I had no pictures in my camera roll from that time because I had grown so much shame for how I looked and I absolutely hated how I looked. That was the very first year that I was not 100% comfortable with my appearance. I was so excited for the summer and for school year to end because I spent so much time in school worrying about how I looked.  I was so happy to FINALLY be free and I told myself I would just focus on my life at home. On the very last week of school, I remember my mom came to my mom with the saddest look on her face, telling me she had just lost her job. That was the second time my mom had lost her job, the first being in 2008, and it obviously was not good news to come home to, especially right before the summer. The news that she had lost her job was icing on the cake to an awful year. Prior to that year, I had never had faced that many problems all at once in such a short time.  That summer I stayed in the house every day and slept most of the day but I still was optimistic about starting high school and thought my mental health would get better. The only highlight of that summer was waking up to find out that gay marriage had been legalized. It was a great day because I finally felt like I was not abnormal. That summer I tried to come out to my mother as gay but she just ended up telling me that I was too young to know that and called being gay a 'decision'. After that, I knew I would never bring my sexuality up to my mom again and I never have. I thought a year in middle school was rough but high school was ten times worse, although I would say my mental health did get a little better. For me, high school was extremely cliquey and as a gay student I just did not fit in. I could probably go on and on for hours about how truly awful it was but I'll condense it a little. I was dealing with horrible social anxiety and as an introvert, many things took a lot of energy out of me. My self esteem plummeted. My freshman year was when I truly realized the atmosphere of the school. As it was only my second year in the district, I did not know that many people or have that many friends. That was very obvious to my peers and they used that against me. So many of the kids had knew each other for years and they created their friend groups based on that. They looked down on anyone that was not in a group, wasn't rich or not \"attractive\" by their standards. So many of the friendships were established based on classism and desirability. I don't blame them, maybe even their parents instilled those values in them. It's just that a classist environment can seem impossible to navigate if you're...lacking the right class. I, again, never got invited to things. I found about things through stories people told or rumors or spending weekends on social media watching people party, drink, have fun, hangout with girls/boys, get high, do whatever. I was in shock at times at how much fun people had versus me. It was almost as if we went to two different schools, two entirely different realities. The few friends I did have were social butterflies so they always had fun things to do with other people, constantly rotating the friends they hung out with on the weekends. On top of that, living with my mom was absolute hell. She would constantly complain about her financial struggles or bills or anything that she had to pay. It was funny to be to see that sons or daughter or rich people be described as people who were never told \"no\" because that is all that I heard from my mother. I cried my eyes out of the first day of my sophomore year. That year, I began failing my classes on purpose because I thought that maybe that would persuade my mother into letting me attend private school, obviously to no avail. I skipped class here and there, disobeyed teachers a few times. Nothing major but it was a complete 180 from the former A-B student who never skipped class that I was. Everyone pretty much got their license and a car to drive, except for me. My parents are divorced but I still had contact with my father and would see him occasionally. I begged my parents to send me to private school and I was livid at my mom for not being able to afford it. My dad ended finding out that I wanted to go to private school and he called me. The conversation was extremely brief and it consisted of him shifting the blame of my circumstances onto me, citing that I \"choose\" to live a gay lifestyle and I am simply suffering the repercussions, with a smidge of vulgarity. I was in such shock that I could not even think of what to say, not that he would have heard me because he immediately hung up the phone. I knew that my father was homophobic but I never thought that he would be so blunt with it, so callous, so selfish and so nasty. I had never even knew that he thought me being gay was a choice because I seriously would not choose to make my life any harder than it presently was. I realized that I could switch around schools but I would never escape \"myself\". I was never not going to be gay. The few people that I called acquaintances had their own groups, friends, girlfriends and most of the social groups consisted of girls and the guys they were in relationships with. I had absolutely no place in that. I pretty much spent the summer of that year going to my therapy appointments and looking for jobs, but nonetheless it was another uneventful summer. My junior year was when I realized that I had made a huge mistake with not taking my education seriously. I knew how hard it would be to raise my GPA and despite working hard, it was basically pointless. It was definitely was a year full of ups and downs. Obviously not important enough to talk about now but pure hell at some moments. The summer that followed was the most miserable I had been and it was the first time I had truly considered suicide. I didn't want to return to school, I had an extremely low GPA, I had little prospects for getting into a good college, my SAT score was not where I wanted it to be, and I had a very small amount of friends and we barely talked over the summer. Most other the kids went to the beach and stayed the entire summer. Summer was so isolating for me. I was so detached from all of them and I really never got any interaction with anyone my age during the summers. I had 4 or 5 pretty good friends, but I was still alone for the majority of my time. I spent that summer, like usual doing absolutely nothing. The few days leading up to the start of my senior year were the most depressing. I did not want to go back at all. It definitely was not a sentimental time for me and I was super miserable through it all. I skipped school a lot my senior year...like at all. I think I missed 45 days and was late to school 20 other times. My poor attendance was 100% my fault and I take full responsibility My grades plummeted, I quit my job, and I was feeling depressed every single day. I came home and went to sleep every single night. At one point, my mom asked if I wanted to be admitted to a hospital. I had such little confidence regarding college that I only applied to 3, one of which I was rejected by. By the end of the year, I realized that I was either going to have to go to community college or spend the rest of my life in debt because my parents could not afford the tuition. Realizing that I should have worked harder during my freshman and sophomore year while knowing there is no way to go back in time haunted me. Let's just skip over the part of high school where I graduated because being in that autitorium was a hot, sweaty, unorganized mess. Also, I had no plans on going until my mom bribed me with money. Fast forward 2 years and I am almost 21 and I have barely any credits because I have not passed most of my classes. I'm also on academic probation. I could not keep up with any of my classes. Knowing how hard it is to find a job with a degree, I have no one what I will do. Being in the pandemic and not really able to make any new friends is not really different that my high school years, but it is still an isolating feeling. Some days I feel too soft for the world. Some days I feel like I JUST want to be a normal guy. Normal, in this context, meaning straight. I wish I had that advantage of fitting in with guys instead of being so different from them and constantly being shamed by that. I wish my parents could afford to pay for me to go to college. I wish I had just an ounce of desirability but instead I've been rejected by...anyone I've ever talked to. I've never had sex...or been on a date...or even kissed anyone. I am no where near mentally healthy enough to date anyone but I also have no partakers. I use the internet a lot, and no matter what app it is I am always reminded how much of a loser I am. Whether, it is people's vacations, going to concerts, hanging out friends, or showing off their money. Money and it's acquisition is a HUGE problem for me. I feel like I will never have enough and I will never not be buried in debt. I feel like I never be able to enjoy my life or have a spouse or family because I will never be in a good place financially. I hate the pressure I put on myself to make a lot of money. I have no idea what I am doing with college and I decided to not re-enroll but I don't know what to do know. I can't move out of my mom's house. I honestly cannot even find a minimum wage job at the moment. I have NOTHING. Being in this situation makes me realize how truly meaningless life can be. I've thought about suicide in the past but last year was the first time that I seriously contemplated doing it. Now, I wake up everyday wishing I was dead. I hate mornings and I count down the hours until I can finally sleep again to avoid this reality. I hate pain and don't want to die painfully but I literally carry on my normal day with numerous suicidal thoughts and how I just no longer wish to live. Literal strangers waving at me from their car when I go on a walk brightens my day sometimes. It's so weird to see people say \"You never know what someone is going through\" because I have now become that person. I know the type of lifestyle that I want to live but sometimes I question, but reality is often disappointing. Frequently, I question do I even deserve it? Is everything in life as far as success not manufactured and predetermined? Do I deserve a good life? Will I ever get to enjoy myself? Do I deserve to live? The answer in my head is always no.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p5mo62/suicidal/", "title": "Suicidal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Creepy_Letterhead873", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629140574, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p5mo62/suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427096.2612083, "replies_charged": false}
