I've in in therapy for years and I don't feel my doctor can help me.  I have great respect for my doctor as she has been trying hard to keep me focused on looking ahead and not on what's wrong in my life.  Lately, I started to feel that I'm wasting her time.  Time that she could be helping someone who really needs her help.  I'm not angry, just tired.  I'm trying to take a few months break from therapy, but my doctor don't feel this is a good idea.  I'm in weekly therapy as I've been hospitalized in March for suicidal behavior.  I just want to stop seeing doctors for awhile and give me time to decide on what to do from here.  My doctor doesn't feel its a good time for this, but it seems like it's never going to be the \"right time\".  Is this going to be the way my life will be the rest of my life?  I had multiple health issues that will be with me the rest of my life.  Its hard for me to accept that mental health would likely be part of my healthcare until I die from natural causes.
