I often find myself creating potential scenarios in my head where I get into arguments with friends and loved ones, which then leads to me escalating it, which then leads to the argument getting worse which then leads to me getting angrier, which leads to me hurting that person or doing something that will cause their life to be worse, like spreading lies about them all over social media, or putting their life in danger by pointing a gun at them and pretending like I'm gonna shoot them--all leading to me killing myself as an excuse of avoiding the consequences that would come from doing these horrible things, but in reality I think there's still apart of me that just really wants to kill myself and will do anything to ensure that it happens smoothly. I also find myself further ruining relationships that were already toxic, instead of trying to repair them or just move on, in an attempt to create an excuse to blame my suicide on them after I'm gone, but in reality i always hated them and wanted them to hurt when and if I died.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pztw36/im_living_my_life_in_a_way_where_i_am_creating/", "title": "I'm living my life in a way where I am creating reasons to kill myself.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CaptainMatureMale", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633176278, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pztw36/im_living_my_life_in_a_way_where_i_am_creating/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425597.0943801, "replies_charged": false}
