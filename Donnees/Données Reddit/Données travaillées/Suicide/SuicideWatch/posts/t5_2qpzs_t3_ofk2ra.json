Now none of that is going to happen.\n\nI knew fate dealt me a losing hand when on the day of my birth nearly was the day of my death, I was severely underweight and I would have died there and then. Ever since that day, i knew it would only go downhill from there. When I was 5 years old, my sister slashed my throat with a blunt knife, the outline of a knife was there but I was not bleeding, my other sister threw a brick at my eye, leaving a nasty scar and damaging my vision, but that was the things I could handle.\n\nWhen I got into school, I was the troublemaker, I always acted up, I was the clown that danced for everyone's amusement. I got detention so many times that I lost count, and I was fine with it, even though my mum tanned my hide every single time.\n\n5th grade was where things to so much worse. Our school at the time didn't have uniforms, so I decided to wear a dress, I could still disguise it as pants so my family didn't know. What I didn't realize was the trouble that would come from dressing like I'm female, I got a lot of sideways looks which I didn't understand at the time. Unfortunately the dress was destroyed, ripped apart by those I thought were my friends, they molested me that day, and I couldn't tell my family that, they'd think I was turned gay, and if you are gay, you would like being touched even without your consent.\n\nWhen my family moved to Chicago, things got worse. People hated that I was weird, and I got into fights, a lot. My first day of school there, I got ambushed and jumped, my head was oozing blood, and I cried on the floor in agony. Later I found out my belongings were stolen as well, so I went home with tears in my eyes and my mum was furious. Not with the people who hurt me, but me for not standing up for myself, She drilled into my head that I needed to FIGHT. And fight I did.\n\nDays became weeks and I was getting into fights daily, not schoolyard brawls that would cover people in dirt and bruises, but brutal fights where blood was spilled, I started going to school armed with a lead pipe in my backpack just to stop people from ambushing me, and taking copious amounts of painkillers when the fights were particularly tough. The painkillers got me addicted to them and I started eating them like candy, I only went cold turkey because my family grew suspicious about them going missing.\n\nWhen I moved to Indiana, I was a mess, I was 16 and I was addicted to drugs, had a reputation for brawling and I got into self harm. I would cut and burn my skin and even provoked fights for others to hurt me. I also developed bulimia at the time, and it was harsh. I also had a boyfriend at the time, I cannot tell my family about him.\n\nHe didn't love me however, he was also 20 years older than me, and he asked me for nudes, many of them through skype. I sent them, thinking he would love me, and then he ghosted me. I never heard from him again. Around that time, the only person who understood my pain, my friend, committed suicide.\n\nBy age 17, I was completely suicidal, I never spoke to others, I reacted to sneers with violence, I was a complete trainwreck. I also got another \"boyfriend\" but he was only a joke made by a sadist I considered my friend, I fell for it, for 3 years. and I still have nightmares about that.\n\nI seen the school therapist for my issues, but she gossiped about what I told her, and that lead to more trouble for me, the fighting became more sadistic, and I began to enjoy them. Fighting because I'm gay, Because I was a Satanist, because people didn't like me. I would hear all the time,  I even referred to myself by slurs. One day, I had enough.\n\nThe school caught me with a knife in my backpack, the knife was used on me exclusively but the staff thought I was gonna murder someone. And quite frankly, If I did, I would just be arrested and raped in prison every day for the rest of my life, and that would be what I deserved. The principal expelled me, not before comparing me to Albert Fish, and telling me \"If there was someone you were going after, it better not be me.\"\n\nAfter being expelled, i been doing odd jobs to make money, and trying to get my GED. I also met some very unsavory people. They either beat me up, lied about me or tried to rape me, because I'm gay, I'm supposed to like that. I was considering even joining the criminal world, not like there was much for me in the real one.\n\nAnd now here I am at 24. Look at my life.\n\nover 15 suicide attempts and years of psychological and mental damage, I guess I deserve what I get.\n\nI have nothing left, I don't have a job, no GED, no future and no hope. I have no friends I can see face to face, I have no ambitions or even a career to strive for. I guess this is goodbye. What worth do I have in the world that doesn't want me. Don't bother talking me out of it, I will already be gone.
