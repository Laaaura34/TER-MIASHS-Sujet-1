It just seems pointless to cause even more suffering. 'Oh look he wrote a note this why he did it' should anyone care to read it. 'Why didnt he come to any of us? Why?' \n\nWhy? Im alone. No one would really care that much. Most would move on very quickly. I suppose my immediate family would mourn for a time but then it'd be over. Come to think of it; I am pretty much dead now. All thats missing is going upstairs and commit one of the various methods I have access to. I'd have to tell my roommate so that cats still get fed since she is out of town. Thats really the only reason Im still here is the cats. I dont want that to be a part of my selfishness. Death is the only thing I have thats for me and me alone. Everything else feels like it is for someone else or something else. Im so fucking tired of it.
