I've been on-and-off suicidal since my late teens.\n\nSince my teens, suicide has seemed *fated.*  It feels like it chose me and since I wasn't ready, it cat-like let me play hide and seek with it for a while. I'll go years looking externally stable (jobs, girlfriends etc), but it always feels false, like part of me knows I'm being granted a temporary reprieve. None of it feels quite real, and there's always a sharp, razory pain whenever something 'real' happens in my life - a girlfriend really opens up to me, or I go to a friends wedding - its like....I really want to be here, and I'm not. It's like Im in the 'sunken place' being held hostage by something.  Like, inside, I'm gun-to-my-head, being told to pretend it's not happening. It feels mean - it's like something is forcing me to live a life without being part of it.\n\nIt's like I'm in an abusive relationship with it. Some psychological thing where I can't tell other people about it - or even if I do, I'm not *really* telling other people. Because the suicidal..thing, voice...is *realer* than other people and - further - *sees and understands me* better than them.\n\nI can hold it together, somewhat, but at a very surface level.\n\nBut I'm at a point where its just too fucking much. Stuff has felt less and less and less real. I've been driving to the town's watertower where no-one goes and just sitting there, in my car. I'll walk around, smoking cigarettes. Sometimes deer go by. My mind feels crumbly and like a bad trip. It almost feels like reality itself is bubbling up and about to pop.  I feel like the whole town (during the pandemic, my job went work-from-home & I  moved back to my rural hometown, with my savings from the city) is going to pounce on me, I feel crazy. I act polite and nice generally, but it feels like its all sliding apart. Its like the suicide part of my brain is coming back to shake me down for my debt. Its truly weird, I'm *acting* like someone with loansharks after him, like the whole towns a loanshark, but for no reason. Its weird. And its feeling less real, but it also feels *more* real.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it has the sense of fate. Its like the drums are beating louder now. And my sense of time is slipping. It seems increasingly like my life is less a few decades, then one long day, like one long bad trip.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI *don't* think I'll kill myself in the coming months. But I don't know if I won't in the coming year. I'm just trying to make sense of it. I feel wicked alone. It really struck me today by my car.
