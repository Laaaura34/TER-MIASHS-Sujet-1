It took my mother to try and talk to her and reason with her but still she would not listen .\nShe got so rude , and I was literally begging her to be nice to me .\n\nI felt like a loser ,  I felt so defeated , I felt like nothing , like a nobody. I tried calling her the following morning but she just told me she wanted to sleep. \n\nI didn't talk to her for a week , and a week later I couldnt be strong anymore and I talked to her.  \nShe was still being rude, she still didn't care  .\nI got off the call and cried again to my mother. \nMy mother got worried and we went and spoke to a counselor,  the coucelor said she might be cheating.\n\nI didn't want to believe she was cheating so I created a fake WhatsApp account using her friend's photo, \nAnd asked her if she was dating in America , she replied \"No I'm still dating my boyfriend from back home and I love him , but we just had a small argument\"   ..\n\nMy grandpa called me because my mom spoke to him , he said I need to let her go , and I'm not handling this like a man. \n\nI feel so powerless , hope less , unworthy , unimportant, I was her first guy", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/osigbj/i_have_a_fixation/", "title": "I have a fixation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Numerous_Fun", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627372586, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/osigbj/i_have_a_fixation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428086.6705139, "replies_charged": false}
