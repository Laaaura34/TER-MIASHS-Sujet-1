I don\u2019t know why do i want to be stopped in the first place. I tried giving life a chance so many times, it\u2019s the same story every time. I want to rest. \n\nPerhaps i should talk to someone i know, but i think it will make me feel worse, i don\u2019t even know how you bring it up with someone you aren\u2019t very close to (im not close enough to anyone, just friendly casual relationships, im not even spending time with people anymore). Like \u201chey, i just wanna tell you that i wanna kill myself tonight..\u201d and.. what next ??? Maybe they\u2019ll think im attention seeking, maybe they will feel guilty and traumatized if i end up killing myself later.\n\nJust thinking. I\u2019m so bored and tired of life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m80a7o/those_who_called_suicide_prevention_hotline_what/", "title": "Those who called suicide prevention hotline, what happened?
