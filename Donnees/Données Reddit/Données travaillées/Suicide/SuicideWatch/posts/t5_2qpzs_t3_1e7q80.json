I have attempted or come very near to attempting suicide on five different occasions.  The first was when I was a teenager.  The next was almost ten years later, and so on, but these \"crises\" are getting closer together.  The last one was last year about this time.  I never sought help for the first four times, but last year I confessed my problem to my wife, went into therapy, and was put on Zoloft.  I quit going to the therapist when my insurance ran out, and stopped taking the Zoloft because I was experiencing some other side effects from it.\nFast forward to now: I can feel myself sinking into another depressive episode, and can't seem to do anything to stop it.  Add to that the stressors that triggered this episode are ongoing and seemingly unavoidable.  I don't want to tell my wife, because I am so tired of being a burden on her, and this just reinforces my feelings of isolation, and therefore my depression.  I'm afraid of another suicidal crisis coming on, but don't feel like I can stop it.  This has happened so many times, that I feel like \"the boy who cried wolf\".  Does anybody have any words of advice?\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e7q80/i_know_that_im_heading_into_a_crisis_in_the_near/", "title": "I Know That I'm Heading Into A Crisis In The Near Future", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jbhall36", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1368405263, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e7q80/i_know_that_im_heading_into_a_crisis_in_the_near/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426148.4287033, "replies_charged": false}
