I am also still in shock and disbelief because she hasn\u2019t 100% died yet, but she is dying. \nIve been through a lot the past two years, 11 inpatient hospitalizations, a suicide attempt, a SA, emotional abuse, C-PTSD, MDD, GAD, SAD, Bulimia, and pending diagnosis on bipolar because i\u2019m underage. \nIt\u2019s like there\u2019s this void in my heart and I can\u2019t bear to think about her or I will start crying again. I feel, empty. It\u2019s a different feeling than how I felt during my episodes. I don\u2019t really know how to explain it. I loved, no, I *love* her so much. I don\u2019t understand why the ones we care about the most get taken from us. I haven\u2019t felt this upset in a long time because my medications finally started helping me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/orqapl/ive_never_lost_anyone_close_to_me_before_is_this/", "title": "I\u2019ve never lost anyone close to me before, is this what grief feels like?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "elysian-soul", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627269357, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/orqapl/ive_never_lost_anyone_close_to_me_before_is_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422926.790446, "replies_charged": false}
