{"id": "t5_2qpzs_t3_2d2h50", "request": ["984215fa-c11f-4227-9099-1707eb1ddba9"], "text": "I'm 21, male. \n\nNo schooling beyond high school. I was claimed by my parents as dependent for two years after being kicked out of my house at 17. That sucked for getting support for college. I also still could not get approval for FAFSA for any amount for two more years, I could not understand why as I knew I wasn't being claimed on my parents' taxes at that point, and I made hardly 23k last year working full time. Tuition is too much to pay for in addition to my normal bills. The job I have now is a sales gig that could dissipate at any time, 23k is the most I can claim I've made any of the past four years I've been working entry level jobs. I've avoided student loans for fear that I may need a cosigner and I've had suicide as an option in the back of my mind all of these years.\n\nMy home life left me with false domestic violence reports which, while not either expunged or left unpursued (nolle prosequi), they show on my records,  and I feel like they're the reason my insurance is gouging me and I seem to have such a shitty call back rate when I apply for jobs. Unfortunately calling the police was my emotionally-distraught mother's way of keeping tabs on me, in addition to advocating my suicide and telling me that she would find whatever legal loophole she could to \"fuck up my record\", take me out of school, and put me in foster care. Whether or not it was feasible for her to do that, it was something I thought was true, and tried to keep in the back of my mind. School would be my focus; I considered it my only way out. In spite of that, I fucked my record for one year. Guess it really didn't matter. \n\nAnyway. Obviously the emotional abuse was undue. It stems from a chaotic relationship with my father, and the fact that I remind her of him. For comparison, my younger sister has been caught with drugs (some form of methamphetamines, unsure of what exactly, marijuana), skipped school, crosswalked, I don't know. Anything my mother would use to justify kicking me out of the house for three days before claiming that I ran away or harassing friends that would provide me with a place to stay with accusations that they were \"abducting\" me. No such treatment or embarrassment befell my sister.\n\nI can create a list of the people who have told me to kill myself, it'll include my parents, grandparents on my mother's side, an ex, and former friends in heated arguments. It was like a trigger at first, the one thing that could take me in any situation and make me clam up or cry. Now it feels like the only thing I wait for. I was put in counseling, and made to believe it's all normal to experience that, my sole responsibility is growing stronger from it. Easier said than done, asshole.\n\nThis whole time I had one light of my life, a friend from high school. She encouraged me every step of the way. Watched as I built up my credit and stabilized my life, bought a car, went from couch surfing to apartment leasing. We started dating and were together for three years. I found out she cheated on me. I found the emails to another guy she met in high school and dated for maybe a month before he split it off and said he wasn't over someone else. I remember talking to her as a friend about what he meant to her and I don't think she ever got over him. I saw texts between them when we first started dating. I at first was pissed, expressed thst I wanted to forbid it. After discovering a third attempt at her hiding the conversations, I told her I didn't care any more, she can call him. She told me at that point that she didn't \"see a reason to.\" She said she'd stop. \n\nFast forward to now. The emails over the course of a month progress from \"don't message me unless I've messaged you in the past hour, I have your phone memorized so don't call me even though the contact info isn't there, I don't want to get in trouble with my boyfriend\", all the way to \"tell me if I'm being too flirtatious,\" \"I can't wait for your next email, I keep updating every 10 seconds\", \"Sorry I kept going last night\".\n\nI didn't even try to discuss it with her. She was on vacation. I told myself I'd wait.\n\nShe comes back and says \"I have things to get off my chest with you.\" Of all the things she could have said. Everything exploded at that point. The moment I mentioned the emails she said she was done and completely ignored me. No calls went through. No texts responded to. She hid for two days at a nameless friend's house. I don't know where she is now. Her parents and family ignore me. I did nothing wrong.\n\nI told her I would kill myself, I think she took it as a cry for attention. It's been 10 days with no answer. I don't think she ever wanted to try to work on things with me. It was her intent from her coming back from the vacation to break it off with me, my discovering her emails and exploding about them only provided her with a quick excuse. My only closure will be these presumptions.\n\nI put money towards rent when she needed the time at school and took time off work. I doted on her every chance I got. She broke her old glasses? Let's get Tiffany frames, my treat. Nice dinners. Best seating in the house. Gifts at random, games or shoes or whatever. She told me I was Mr. Perfect so many times. We only recently stopped living together when she moved back in with her grandmother and the rift began to form, she contacted this guy... And after years of this, after all the stories of hearing about cheating, I thought I found the right person... But she doesn't even feel I'm worth giving closure to. Heck, why should she? She has her board and tuition taken care of now that she has seemingly no inhibitions about asking her family for help.\n\nI feel broken. I won't ever be able to function again. I can't trust, I can't smile at work. I can't find anyone to engage with intellectually or artistically, my only methods of coping.  My education is nil, my single loan has no cosigners... I won't leave behind anything. I can buy a shotgun, wear a white mask and lay out towels to reduce the clean up work and trauma on whoever finds me parked by the beach and do it now. Day 10 and I still cannot stop counting the seconds I've overstayed in this world. I want my escape. I want my next adventure. Hopefully next time I won't carry over these memories of betrayal, hopefully my the better half of my nature carries over, and hopefully I trip upon the right person. \n\nI hope you all find something worth living for. I hope you live for a long time before you even contemplate something like this. I sincerely wish you're never betrayed by the last person to mean anything to you. This world is beautiful and I'm honestly missing out by not being around to see it. It's just not something I can see beauty in anymore.
