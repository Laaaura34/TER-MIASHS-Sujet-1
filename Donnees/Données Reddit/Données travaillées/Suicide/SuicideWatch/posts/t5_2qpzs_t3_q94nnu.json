I live alone, I used to have a dog but she passed away at the end of September. \n\nI now look absolutely horrible, the worst I\u2019ve ever looked. I have extreme social anxiety whereas before I didn\u2019t. I started transitioning last May, and all my excitement for it has been replaced with dread over how I look now.\n\nI feel like a ghost, I don\u2019t talk to people unless it\u2019s work related over zoom, I don\u2019t even have my dog to talk to anymore. \n\nI\u2019m going to be traveling to reunite with my girlfriend, but honestly I\u2019m so afraid of her seeing me in person now. \n\nI started using drugs again to kill the boredom. I know I should be putting effort into getting back in shape, but mentally I am just so exhausted and sick of myself that I can\u2019t. \n\nI think I\u2019m going to purposefully overdose. The only reason I haven\u2019t yet is I want to see my girlfriend. But I\u2019m so nervous about that, and in my mind it feels like things won\u2019t be okay.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q94nnu/hate_being_alone/", "title": "Hate being alone", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "crustpunkbitch", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634357698, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q94nnu/hate_being_alone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427000.3770316, "replies_charged": false}
