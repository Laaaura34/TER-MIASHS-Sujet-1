I haven't, yet hate myself so much I feel like I have. Also I just turned 22 and I'm a U.S. male.\n\nI was looking into the case of this SWATting where some guys called a hostage situation in on this guy's house over a game of Call of Duty. The dude (not related to the situation at all) opened the door, and was shot immediately. They made his niece walk over his body. She committed suicide at 18. I have experienced something similar. I also have looked up a lot of suicides over false rape accusations. This happens all the time and has happened to me.\n\nI'm trying to be very concise here because there's a lot of things that happened. I was the victim of very serious domestic violence by my brother growing up, who is a foot taller than me. It resulted in a lot of broken phones and strangulations and a stabbing and lots of blows to the head, busted lips and bloody noses, and a screaming father and crying mother. My mother got addicted to Oxycodone and Xanax when I was 11/12. She was constantly incapacitated and it got to the point where she was unconscious every day during high school, up until she overdosed and died on the floor in front of me, naked, choking on her own vomit. At the same time, I had an absent father. He was always gone and would not get my brother the \"help\" he and my mom said they would get him, so he essentially allowed the domestic abuse to continue. He would be gone for weeks at a time, come home screaming every day, cheated on my mom as she was dying, and threw his ring at her on Christmas Eve 2015 shouting \"I fucking hate you\" at her. After my mother passed away, he was never home with me or my brother. I was only 16 and he was out with new girlfriends pretty quickly, and he allowed me to live with my adult, graduated, 18 year old girlfriend when I was 16 that he knew was abusing me.\n\nMy dad either is a fucking idiot or does not understand the many things he does wrong. My brother threw a TV tray at me and I asked him what I am supposed to do about that and he said \"you have to fight through it\". That's all he says. He offers no advice and takes no accountability and tells me \"you have to fight through it\" and when I finally decided to talk to him about how I feel he was literally looking at his phone going \"mhm. Mhm\". I overdosed on Carisoprodol some time ago and he watched me and as soon as I was able to walk and talk he gave me my keys and left. He didn't even ask if I did it intentionally or if it were an accident. He finally said the other day he was a bad father and I just kind of told him \"I don't really care about what you're saying. That's a you problem.\" I mean he didn't even teach me how to change a tire for fuck's sake, he never supported me, the extent of the college talk was \"which college are you going to\" and that was literally it. I had no support or guidance growing up and it's ruined me as an \"adult\" and I'm immature and irresponsible, I was never taught basic things like laundry and cleaning or even how to fucking drive. One time he left my brother alone with me after he hit me on my 11th birthday and screamed \"I hate my fucking life\" and stormed off, which makes me think either one of us was an accident, or he didn't want to marry my mom. I had to literally beg him to come home many times because I was tired of being trapped in a dark room all day and he wouldn't even do it and he'd say \"you don't leave the room\". Exactly. That's the point. YOU ARE MY FATHER.\n\nThe abuse was at school too, I was bullied really bad and was physically assaulted a lot. There was this one kid that would shove me every single day and knock all my shit over, a kid that would punch me in the arm, two kids that would shove me while pissing, a guy that threw my shoes in the toilet, you name it. Teachers even joined in and allowed it to happen. There was this one teacher in the 6th grade that halted class to collect a communal list of the 3 least liked kids in class, because she wanted to read it off and humiliate me. That was the first time I had a suicidal thought. Age ELEVEN. She'd laugh as a kid shoved me in a bookshelf and in one case sent me in the same room as a kid who beat me up in there - you get the gist. In high school this stopped but an abusive principal began harassing and picking on me, suspending me literally in her own words \"because I can\", that didn't leave me alone after my mom passed away. It further alienated me from my peers and the social ostracization got worse because people thought I was some type of criminal, when really I was just a kid with insomnia that was late to class and missed school. She searched me a bunch of times and never found even a spec of pot or a rolling paper.\n\nThe ex-girlfriend from earlier was 18 and I was 15 when I started dating and for whatever reason, my parents allowed her to move in and would coddle her and take care of her. She lived here from 18-22. Her abuse was pretty extreme, mostly just mental abuse \"You fucking piece of shit\", screaming, talking down on me to everyone/posting mean things about me on social media, etc. and there was some physical stuff and at the end, sexual abuse. For whatever reason my dad never thought \"hey this adult woman is living with my teenage son, abusing him, isolating him from his friends and family which includes me, maybe I should do something about it\". Nope. She would show up to my house unannounced and wouldn't let me break up with her and I was just wanting my parents to do something and they never did. After we broke up, she started falsely accusing me of rape. Now, luckily, I have SMS data on an old phone of her admitting to lying, so if she ever tries to prosecute me for this, which is not out of the question, I can at least feel safe knowing that I have those messages. I kept hearing it from people and even a friend of 15 years messaged me calling me a rapist and saying \"I know what YOU did to Anon\". It was horrifying and now I'm paranoid of women, sex and relationships, and I don't want to be intimate with anyone. Eventually I heard it again and I just kind of snapped and I made an empty threat of a lawsuit against her if she didn't stop, because I was tired of fearing for my safety and being labeled a rapist, and she threw a fit and tried to get people to threaten me physically. I think she stopped at this point and somehow played the victim and still does to this day, but the damage is done. Once you have that label there is no going back, and it's exacerbated my paranoia to a severe extent and I'm terrified to leave the house.\n\nSomething similar happened which was pretty bad, and it caused me to have a serious mental breakdown. I was at a friend's house that I knew for ten years and she was drunk and sexually assaulted me. Afterwards, she beat the shit out of me. I had a sprained elbow and everyone was acting like everything was fine so I messaged my friend that I felt victimized and within five minutes the girl that assaulted me messaged me \"what the fuck is wrong with you?\". Cue constant harassment, being told I'm a fucking psychopath, fucked in the head, crazy, etc. and losing all my friends. I blacked out for the first time as a trauma response after she physically assaulted me and I was a blackout drinker up until I turned 22. I had people I didn't even know bullying me, and she has told literally so many people \"her side\", getting to the point where she says she had \"a sports bra\" on when she did what she did, and I believe she may have falsely accused me as well, because she was tired of hearing about it. Well, you did it. If you don't want people to know you're sexually and physically violent, don't be sexually and physically violent.\n\nOh, and to top it all off - I'm a prescribed Xanax addict. The insomnia and anxiety caused by my mother passing resulted in my doctor putting me on 4 mg of Xanax daily when I was \\*seventeen\\*, AFTER my mom passed away from an overdose of Xanax and Oxycodone. No one intervened - the school didn't contact CPS, my dad didn't do anything, my doctor saw no issue in that, my therapist saw no issue with that, etc., and I can't get off. I'm frantic, paranoid and anxious every day so I have to take it, but the physical dependency is the issue. The chef's kiss on my hopelessness is that I was put in a psych ward after attempting on my 22nd birthday, and they didn't give me my medication and I nearly died of withdrawals. Seizures and convulsions under medical care that they referred to as \"panic attacks\". You just don't know what it means to be truly helpless until you're dying of withdrawals in a place where you're supposed to get medical help, and no. One. Cares.\n\nI am just having a little trouble understanding why I'm being forced to carry on here. My dad says \"I already lost your mom, I can't lose you or your brother\". Well, I sure as hell don't feel like you would care that much, you haven't really shown to me that you care about me as a human being, let alone a son. This is the same man who would go on vacations with his new family and not tell me. Or ask me \"Hey, we're going to Branson, wanna go?\" FIVE minutes before they left. I only have my brother, my dad and my grandma left, the rest of my family including my sister died between 15-21.\n\nI'm not trying to be shitty here but I mean seriously. Why the fuck am I being FORCED to be miserable every single day? I have no friends, I'm psychologically traumatized possibly beyond repair, I am unable to hold down a job due to my depleted mental health, I've been falsely accused of fucking rape, I'm a hopeless Xanax addict, and I'm a college dropout with no future.\n\nMy quality of life is 0. Honestly. What even is the point? I'm not allowed to experience joy or happiness or love, my youth was stolen from me, I'm an incompetent individual, I have no idea how to act as an adult due to a complete lack of parental guidance during my teenage years, I am so exhausted that I can't even eat, can't sleep, can't go to the gym, can't pay attention to a movie, can't focus in the few conversations I do have.\n\nIf I were a dog, you'd euthanize me. I don't understand why I am forced to suffer. Oh, and if I \\*do\\* kill myself, I have to use a fucking firearm and make it messy and traumatizing, because assisted medical suicide isn't legal. My point is that people kill themselves for way, \\*way\\* less, all the time. At the beginning I mentioned that the girl that stepped over her uncle's dead body after witnessing his murder committed suicide - I've stepped over my mother's dead body as she was naked and asphyxiating on her own vomit in cardiac arrest. And more, and more, and more... at a certain point, a human being can only handle too much.
