Everything takes so much energy, I brush my hair and pass out for a couple hours. I can't live like this. I can't heal, can't get better, can't complete my stupid God damn tasks, I can't do anything. I'm so fucked and everyone looks at me like it's my fault. Like it's some moral failing to struggle while having a brain that is genuinely fucking broken. I want it to end. I want to stop being judged for all my pain. I want to stop being a burden on the world", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5xkfs/i_fucking_wish_i_was_dead/", "title": "I fucking wish I was dead", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheSandwichMeat", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633963953, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5xkfs/i_fucking_wish_i_was_dead/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425456.3885672, "replies_charged": false}
