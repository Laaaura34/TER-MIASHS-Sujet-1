Since then, my career is filled with shitty consumer services, moderation, and risk/fraud jobs. They are jobs were everything is done to avoid you to use your brain, you are just a robot who have to make an high number of tickets by day. If you don\u2019t do them, you are harassed by your team leader and if you make them your target is augmented. Anyway, I\u2019ve been depressed for years, now I just have the energy anymore. I know that I\u2019ll never recover a interesting career; and the fact that I contracted I chronic disease because of the stress avoid me to return to school. I\u2019m so depressed that I can\u2019t concentrate anymore on my new job. The only thing who retain me to not kill myself is that I don\u2019t want my flatmmate who is younger than me (25yrs) to have to deal with the discovery of my dead body. Because of my chronic disease I refuse to date People. Considering the goals of my life were to find a guy to whom I would have been devoted and then to add a career in a specific domain; but these two will never happens anymore. I don\u2019t see why should I continue to live. Wake up every morning to be treat like shit by a boss who is probably less graduates than me.
