I just remembered some very triggering things that happened to me as a child. And I\u2019m unmedicated rn. And I kind of want to be on meds but I\u2019m back at a point that I no longer care what happens to me. \n\nSo that\u2019s fun. Just told my husband I wanted a divorce. Came out as trans this year. Back at square one since breaking it off and I\u2019m unable to work due to my mental health being so bad. \n\nI\u2019m debating going back to the hospital currently. But I don\u2019t believe it would really help me. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just getting closer and closer to cutting the cord without telling a soul.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q3g46d/ahhh_hello_darkness_my_old_friend_lolol/", "title": "Ahhh hello darkness my old friend lolol", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "zamudio00", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633633449, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q3g46d/ahhh_hello_darkness_my_old_friend_lolol/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425190.645748, "replies_charged": false}
