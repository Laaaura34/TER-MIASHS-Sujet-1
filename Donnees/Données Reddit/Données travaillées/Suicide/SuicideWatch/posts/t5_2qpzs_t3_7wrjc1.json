Wrote of my cell in a blind depressed misery state...\n\nIdk first time on here, I have been really depressed lately. This is probably the worst one I have been in. I suppose just just trying to get stuff off my back. I see a lot of people also struggle with shit in life, I defiantly do. I often think of killing myself almost every other day. Ive planned some out, and I got a few ways I would wanna go. I even tried hanging myself once before 2 years ago. I unfortunately the rope broke after I blacked out, and woke up on the ground. And called a friend who brought me to the hospital. They say things usually get better. But since than all it has made me do is regret not dying that day. I wanna kill myself so bad but I cant. I was born into a huge family, I have 5 sisters and 1 brother. Life wasnt easy growing up, I was in foster care until I in grade 1.\n\n And my mother finally got us back. And my Dad was there as well. Things where alright until about grade 6 my parents fought more sometimes physically, they seperated. But we stayed with our Mom. And our Dad would always make us feel like shit for taling her side. And always insult her and say things like go live witg your druggy mom. And my mom did suffer from addiction but she wasnt as bad then. As the years went on my Dads mental abuse and mind games started to really affect her. And me and my brother about grade 8, 9 started to misbehave and cause trouble. We started drinking, drugs. Fights, run ins with the cops. And so after while taking care of 3 girls, my other 2 sisters are older. And 2 pretty rebelous boys. She was pretty strong to do it for awhile, but she started to break. And afterwhile she was doing more drugs. Going out more, and leaving us kids at home alone. \n\nSo as time went on, the ministry got involved. I was luckily enough to end up on independant living. My younger brother wasnt as fortunate, he wasnt accepted because he was a little bit more ill tempered than me he wounded up on the streets. And starting going down a different path than I did. Things around this time kinda got better its like a rollercoaster you go high for a bit and then you  just start going down alot a faster than when you came up..During that time I met a girl and things where kinda going up from there. But after year into our relationship, it declined. During it I would messages between her and her ex.. And a few times I let her go hang out with some friends that hung around her ex. But as time went on, Istarted to get more suspicious and aware of what was going on. So I started to put my foot down a little bit more. Which seemed to cause more fights, she seemed to think I was being \"controlive\". One summer went up to visit my Dad. And well I was way she went to a party without telling me. I got mad, and didnt talk to her for a couple days. Then after we made up, and couple more days later she admited while we werent talking she hooked up with her ex. And when she told me that, my heart sunk, Ive never been that emotional hurt ever. It still hurts to this day. I was pretty mad, she was saying she was extremely sorry and blah blah. I ended up forgiving her but Deep down I was furious. \n\nI started drinking till I was blacked out. Fighting people at partys, doing hard drugs, went on downward spiral. Got my bottom teeth punched out, assault with a deadly wrapon charge landed me 3 months in jail. After that I tried to hang myself.  She still managed to stick around for year or so more. But I could tell the feeling wasnt there anymore with her. She eventually left me again. Which also hurt me pretty good again. I guess she was my first love, and still love her to this day. Idk Im not the best guy at getting girls. Idk why that is. So 4 years with one girl its hard. You knoe someone for that long than there gone. I think it feels worst then if the person passed away. Because theres so mucb history there and its all gone there alive but you cant see them anymore. she knows my darkest secrets, my weakness, evrythinng. We dont talk or see each other at all. Like we dont tknow each other. I left the city. And year later not even it was like 4 months what do you know. I find out shes back dating her ex boyfriend who dated her before me and was the one she hooked up with... Im crushed, devistated, I cant recover. Its been 2 years since we split. I havent got a girlfriend, Ive been on dates but Idk nothing feels the same. I guess Im too cautios or just untrustworthy towards other people. I dont wanna let them in again. \n\nSo thats just one of my problems last april in 2017 one of my sisters commited suicide.. And that really hurt as well.. And probably one of the reason why it makes it so hard for me to do it. Ive felt that pain, I dont wanna put my sisters, and my brother through it again. And also my Mom just passed away in October2017 from cancer. All I have are my sisters and my Dad. But were not close, I kinda despise him in away. I once tried to tell him my problems and all he said was just get over it.... Thats all.. Idk for me its not that easy I cant. My Brother is also looking at 6-10 years in jail for attempted murder. He went down a pretty dark path involved in dealing drugs and gangs.. He calls me every week and it hurts me to know that he is in that situation. I also feel shitty looking back at went my brother and I put my mom through. And not helping her out more. \n\n So like I said its almost everyday i think about ending it all, I started smoking crystal meth a couple months ago, if I wasn't High Id probably would have blown my brains out already. im 22 years old. sometimes I dont even wanna work. Work is gruelling as fuck. It makes worse most people dont know what I go through I dont tell a lot of people. And sometimes Ill be having a bad day and Ill get yelled at from the boss. The employees have this thing where we always put each other down and rip on each other. I do sometimes participate to try and fit in but sometimes Ill have shitty day and having negative stuff directed towards constantly starts to impact you. but if you get actually hurt they call you bitch or a pussy,, Ive had it with negative stuff. Itd be nice to have positive thinking and vibes, complimentts and stuff. Not shit like being called a bitch, and pussy for not being able to do something. Or a fag for liking different music. Idk thats just my rant about life. \n\nThanks whoever took the time to read it this far I appreciate it. And lets all try and be positive and lend a hand to one another.
