For the past couple of months or so i have been deeply depressed, best described as just a 'lack of purpose', i feel as though everything we do is ultimately pointless and that life is essentially meaningless. I have done my best to try and get rid of these feelings but they just seem to persist, and i cannot seem to find any real activity that brings joy and fulfillment to my life. Because of this feeling of melancholy, i constantly think about committing suicide to just get my life over and done with, and to end my suffering, but i also know each and every time that i think about suicide that I dont have the power to actually do that to myself, and deep down, although i find my life meaningless, i dont want to go through the pain and consequences of killing myself. I see it as too extreme and far fetched an idea, even though i think about doing it each and every day. Anyway, interested to see what other people think of this....", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bo2372/constant_feelings_of_suicide_but_no_real/", "title": "Constant feelings of suicide but no real intention of acting on them?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "conorwhite_3", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 37, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1557745720, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bo2372/constant_feelings_of_suicide_but_no_real/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427546.3233166, "replies_charged": false}
