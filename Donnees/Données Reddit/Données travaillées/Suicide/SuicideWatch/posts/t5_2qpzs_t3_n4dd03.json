I've been with my bf for 15 yrs and within the last 2 yrs has become verbally and physically abusive, and I am part to blame. This year I've been going through an extremely dark time, but quit drinking in hopes that could fix our problems. Now I have time to think and alot of regret. I tried to cut myself a few months ago, and my bf didn't take it seriously. He called it \"a scratch\" and just wanting attention. 2 weeks ago I took 30 aleve but just had a stomach ache. 3 days ago I bought razor blades so it couldn't be just a scratch. I keep holding them and crying and hiding them away. Idk if im upset that I want to die, or that I don't want to die. I have no one to turn to.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n4dd03/where_do_i_go_from_here/", "title": "Where do I go from here?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bambeeen", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620093441, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n4dd03/where_do_i_go_from_here/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422274.6934674, "replies_charged": false}
