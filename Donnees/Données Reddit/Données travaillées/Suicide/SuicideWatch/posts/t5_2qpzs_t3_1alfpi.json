I was always very shy, introverted and awkward. At the age of 11 my family moved across the country to a large city where my life pretty much fell apart and never recovered.\n\nAt my new school I was constantly bullied from day one. People would rip my clothing, throw food on me, physically beat me up at every opportunity, push my face or hands in the toilet, throw my books and posessions on the school roof, etc. It went on like that for years until in high school my anxiety levels were so high that I couldn't function and I refused to go to school any more and was placed in an alternative school.\n\nOnce there, *finally* away from the bullying, I started drinking and using drugs. Marijuana, LSD and Crystal Meth along with occasionally using random pills that I got a hold of or huffing Freon. None of it was for fun, it all was a way of self medicating my depression and anxiety. I didn't have any real friends but I had people I used drugs and drank with. Once I graduated high school I moved into my own apartment, gradually lost all my drug \"friends\" and stopped using illegal drugs while at the same time switching to drinking alcohol to the point of black out drunkeness, alone on a nightly basis.\n\nOver the next five or six years I was almost constantly drunk. I lost jobs, was homeless for a few short stretches, went to jail on multiple occasions for more than one DUI/DWI. I first tried committing suicide around age 22 by slashing my wrists. It didn't work but to this day I still have large obvious scars from the attempt. Around a year later I tried a second time by rerouting my cars exhaust into the passenger compartment but some random people found me before I succeeded.\n\nAround the age of 25 I had a job with decent medical insurance so I used that to attempt to seak mental health and work on fixing myself. I successfully quit drinking and over the next few years I saw numerous therapists, psychologists and counselors of all types but none of them could help me with my depression and anxiety. I was diagnosed with everything from depression to PTSD to social anxiety disorder. No matter who I saw or how hard I tried, therapy never helped me one bit.\n\nI was also concurrently seeing psychiatrists who were attempting to deal with my problems through a variety of medications. I was on a variety of doses of different SSRI's and later different SSRI alternatives but none of them had the desired affect and after *years* of trying, I gave up on that route.\n\nI switched gears and tried getting my life in order by going back to school. I enrolled in some classes but found that I couldn't remember even the slightest bit of what I was trying to learn. I always knew that I had really bad memory but this really put it in the forefront. Read me a seven digit number and ask me to repeat it and I can't. My memory is that bad. I try reading a book and halfway through the page I forget what I am reading. So I went to see my physician about my memory.\n\nAfter all kinds of tests, brain scans and other things they determined that my bad memory was likely the result of frequent meth use as a teenager and years of daily binge drinking as an adult and that there was no cure or fix for my condition. None the less I kept trying at school, but it was hopeless and I eventually gave up on bettering my life through school. \n\nSo there I end up. In my late twenties. I had been sober for years. I had tried every kind of mental health option available to no avail. I was actually experiencing more clarity and self awareness than I had at any prior point in my life. I was miserable but I made a pact to take life day by day as long as I could, either until something got better or I couldn't take it anymore and killed myself. Life went on and I stoically pushed through day after day until when I was 30 years old something miraculous happened.\n\nI met a woman who liked me and I liked her. She also had a very difficult and painful past and a variety of mental issues herself. We fell in love almost immediately and within a year we had moved in with each other. About a year later we got married.\n\nRight from the start, the marriage has been incredibly rocky. She asked for a divorce a few times but I talked her out of it. We went to marriage counseling on multiple occasions and although it temporarily helped, in the long term it didn't fix our problems. I am the main person responsible for the problems in our marriage and my wife is a saint to have lasted as long as she has with me.\n\nOver the years my wife has been the center of my universe. The only real friend I have ever had. The only person who I have ever really loved and who has loved me in return. The pleasure and contentness of just cooking dinner with her or laying in bed with her in the morning made all the misery in my life before her worth it. When we first got married she was always smiling and happy. But after 7 years with me she now has a permanent frown etched in her face and she never laughs but crys often. She still loves me but cannot be in the relationship anymore and I do not blame her. She can do far better than me. I feel horrible for making her life so miserable.\n\nSo here we are. I am 37 years old and I am feeling just as much anxiety and depression as I ever have. After a bad arguement my wife has filed for divorce. The paperwork has all been signed and submitted. The lease on our house is up in a month and we will go our separate ways. \n\nI just do not have any fight left in me anymore. After a life time of fucking up and failures and bad decisions and misery I finally found someone who made me happy and I ended up just dragging her down and making her as miserable as me. And that hurts worse than anything else.\n\n**UPDATE:** I realize now that if I were to kill myself, it would emotionally destroy my wife forever. I care too much about her to do that. So for now I will just carry on as best I can andtry to deal with the situation.\n\nThank you for everyone who commented here. I appreciate it.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1alfpi/lifelong_depression_and_anxiety_finally_come_to_a/", "title": "Lifelong depression and anxiety finally come to a terminal point", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JD1138", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1363705068, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1alfpi/lifelong_depression_and_anxiety_finally_come_to_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426324.4023445, "replies_charged": false}
