i want to smash my head against a rock. disagreement with my parents? i want to stab myself in front of them. failed exam? i miss school for a week. \ni can't deal with myself anymore. i\u2019m the most toxic human being ever. i'm useless, mean, pessimistic, egotistical, hypocritical, i lie all the time, i used to be a bully in middle school, i want to hurt anyone who ever disagrees with me... i'm such a piece of human trash. i'm not only a victim of abuse from my family but i'm also most probably the abuser in someone else's life.\n\ni was supposed to go back to school. start fresh. get my diploma this year. all of that after a terrible last year. i wake up, still in bed, i'm supposed to be awake at 6am but it's 6:17, meaning i'm already late, i don't have time to properly get up that my mom barged in my room, screams at me, curses at me, then get out. not long after my sis and her complains about me, my mom act like having a \"late\" notice from my school is the worst thing ever and wants to tell the principal that i'm dropping out just because she doesn't want to justify a motive for why i'm late. my sis acts like getting asked if i'm okay by my teachers is the worst thing ever. everyday she complains to my mother how she gets asked that all the time and she doesn't know how to respond. \nmy mom and her argue? because of me. sis comes home tired? because of me. mom has a headache already in the morning? because of me. \n\nthey shame me, curse at me, hit me, throw shit at me, disrespect me. i get so angry that i snap and break something, throw something at them, hurt myself, scream at them, or something like that. they all mentally and physically abuse me.\n\nmy breaking point was when my dad and i got into a huge argument. so big the police got involved. i was sleeping on the couch one evening when my parents arrived home. they started having an argument with my sister because she ate before taking a shower... :/ my dad started cursing my sis very badly. i got involved because i'm the oldest sibling and this was unacceptable. when i got involved his anger turned towards me. he started cursing at me and i was so fed up with him i went to my room and closed the door after telling him a piece of mind. after i went to my room i put my headphones on and started to listen to music to mute the screaming downstairs. he got so angry that i challenged him he came back up and started strangling me with the headphone cords. i was so shocked i took the closest thing (my bag) and threw it at his face. he got even more angry he wanted to hit me but i dodged and went in the corridor. he then started strangling me against the wall and wanted to throw me down the stairs. i had to hit him in the face for him to let go cause it got to a point where i couldn't breathe anymore. at this point i was so angry at him and was only seeing red, my skin started to warm up and i had so much adrenaline i thought i was going to explode. i took the AC that was close and threw it at him that caused the house electricity to shut down completely. we were in the complete dark and i felt like i could kill him any time. \n\nthe police came because i was yelling at my parents so loudly i'm sure the neighbors heard everything about our argument and they called the cops.  the cops came but my parents feigned ignorance and they went back... they probably thought it was a conjugal argument and no kids involved. \nby the way i was only 14 when that happened. i'm still unsure about the details cause i was so emotional during that event. i'm also still surprised that i could lift the AC with my thin two arms at that age. i believe it was a rush of adrenaline that gave me the strength at that time, i really wanted to kill him. also, my little brother becomes very anxious when he hears loud sounds. he is scared of them. he was trembling  and sweating of anxiety under his covers when my dad and i were arguing. \n\nafter that event it went totally downhill. i was already struggling and sleeping 3 hours a day, but after that it was torture. my parents always hit me since i was a child, they also were very emotionally abusive. i honestly don't know how i survived with them for 18 years. i was always miserable but that huge argument with my dad was probably what broke our family. i still haven't forgiven him for that and i show it clearly. my mom and sis say it's my fault it's always so tense at home. haha what do you want me to do? forgive someone who almost choked me to death??? i hate it here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q6gmcb/rant_about_my_mental_health/", "title": "rant about my mental health", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Haaymah", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634023228, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q6gmcb/rant_about_my_mental_health/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426528.3655608, "replies_charged": false}
