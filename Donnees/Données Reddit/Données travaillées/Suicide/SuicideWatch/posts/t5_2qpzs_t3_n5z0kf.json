My dad and I \u2018rekindled\u2019 our relationship after he left when I was 4 yrsold. He was abusive to myself, my siblings and my mom then left to marry his current wife And current kids. Came back when I was 11 and basically judge, ridiculed and chastised me and my siblings then kicked me out. My bf of 10 yes broke up with me yesterday because I \u2018 made him unhappy\u2019 I feel purposeless. I have no friends or close family members. I\u2019ve written my notes to respective persons. But I\u2019m genuinely ready to go. I\u2019m grateful for the sacrifice Jesus made but I\u2019m not cut out for this life. This pain is unbearable, I\u2019d like to not make it to tomorrow.
