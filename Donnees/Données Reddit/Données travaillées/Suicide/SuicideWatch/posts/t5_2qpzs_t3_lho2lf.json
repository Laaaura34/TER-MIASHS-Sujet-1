Everyone says things like hang in there, be strong, don't lose hope, this too shall pass, etc. They don't even care to understand the reason why the other person is wanting to commit suicide. They say life's a gift. But ykw? Not all gifts are great. \n\nThey say think about the people who suffer more than you. I mean, idk why they choose to suffer. What makes them think that suffering is good? Or they are too afraid to take their own life. I've seen people who live on roadsides without even a decent tent giving birth to multiple kids. First of all why? And second of all how? Why you put poor souls into this miserable life when you know that you're not gonna become better. And how could they think about marriage, family, etc when they don't even have enough food. And why must I feel happy that I'm not them? And why should one be happy to know that someone is going through something worse than them? Is this a fucking competition? \n\nIt's all stupid. Life has no meaning. I'm here because my parents wanted someone to love and take care of them at their old age.
