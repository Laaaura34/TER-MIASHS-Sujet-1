I wish dying wasn\u2019t so hard and there was a button I could press that could erase my entire existence without having to kill myself. That way it\u2019ll be easier for everyone around me and myself. Less painful. If I had that option I would take it in a heart beat. I\u2019ve been going in and out of the prayers room (my family is Buddhist btw) to lit up incense and wishing that death could come sooner and take me away so I don\u2019t have to. If that\u2019s too much then at least give me an illness that can kill me so I don\u2019t have to take my own life. Anything, even my brain having an aneurism. I don\u2019t care if I go peacefully or painfully since everyday is already painful enough. I\u2019ve done this about 3 times today because I\u2019m tired of pushing myself. I know praying isn\u2019t a wishing well, and it\u2019s selfish to ask for death instead of strength, but I\u2019ve been fighting for a long long time now. \n\nI\u2019d also like to add on that I\u2019ve had my first cat for 6 years. He has helped me throughout the hard times such as whenever I have anxiety and panic attacks, seizures, suicidal ideations, etc. Overall he\u2019s been there forever since I\u2019ve battled with depression. Recently I decided to get a new kitten and my other cat isn\u2019t happy about it. Everyone say it\u2019ll get better without time but he\u2019s also mean to me. I even read that he will possibly never love me again. He even growls at me and gets aggressive with me because the kitten\u2019s scent is all over me. He won\u2019t let me hold him anymore or cuddle with him. He won\u2019t sleep with me anymore or be there for me when I have a panic attack. I\u2019ve been struggling with depression today and I feel so utterly alone. He has saved me from many suicide ideations before when I think about ending it but he won\u2019t even come near me anymore. I\u2019m crying my eyes out. I just want him to love me again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p5xzff/i_wish_death_could_take_my_soul_sooner/", "title": "I wish death could take my soul sooner.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Tangliness", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629180221, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p5xzff/i_wish_death_could_take_my_soul_sooner/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635425173.2926884, "replies_charged": false}
