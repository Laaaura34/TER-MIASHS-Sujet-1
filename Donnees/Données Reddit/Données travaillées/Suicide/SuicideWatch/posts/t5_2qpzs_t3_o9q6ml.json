I've never been one to have a lot of friends, its always been one or two throughout my whole life. But now, i have one friend whom im too depressed to even contact. Im a shitty friend, a shitty person too. This is one of the lowest times I've been in all year. No matter how much meds or therapy i get mental illness will destroy me. It's not even a matter of \"if\" anymore. It's only a matter of when.\n\n I just want somebody, anyone, to just be close friends with. I just genuinely want to take care of someone too. Hold them, be there for them, but at this point its only a fantasy. \n\nI really cant take it anymore, i really cant. I cry at the drop of a hat, ive been sobbing most of the day. My breath feels short, and my chest hurts. I truly cannot think of a future for me. I don't know what to do anymore. Im so indecisive.
