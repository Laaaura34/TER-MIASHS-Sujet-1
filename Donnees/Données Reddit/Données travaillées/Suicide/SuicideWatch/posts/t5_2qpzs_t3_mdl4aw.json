When jt could be something noble, necessary, beuatiful, and valued. \n\nNear where i live a young man open fired on random people, killing four or so. finally he turned the gun at himself and commited suicide.  \n\nIt was apparently spontaneous. an employee had asked him to leave due to bullying comments at elderly customers the week before.\n\nI researched his life. It was all very sad, lonely, and marred by mental health problems. just like many of us here.\n\nDoesnt have to be murder.  Abusing others, being a menace to society, any number of things that takes away from the world without giving back.\n\nBefore those things happen, I realize for myself suicide is the right thing to do.  Suicide is taboo here and in many cultures.  Japan is an exception. High rates with often younger people killing themselves due to failure and internal misery. Japananese culture is also very kind and polite. \n\ni admire that.  I know when it might be time to leave early I wont hesitate. I will never let life turn me into a monster.\n\nSuicide, as something noble and beuatiful. \n\nthank you friends i love you all", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mdl4aw/suicide_as_something_noble_and_necessry/", "title": "Suicide as something noble and necessry", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dndkskcnslsbd", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616752168, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mdl4aw/suicide_as_something_noble_and_necessry/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428444.5611675, "replies_charged": false}
