Still want to kill myself. I keep having episodes of rage, sometimes I feel like the entire world should be bombed because we're all trash, I have developed intense self-hate and have realized I have no compassion for myself whatsoever. Sometimes, if my eyes even slightly water up and I know I'm going to cry, I smack myself in the face repeatedly to get over it. My inner voice basically screams at me that I'm a weakass piece of shit, guilts me over everything, tells me everyone else would be better off if I killed myself so they wouldn't have to deal with the huge burden I place on them. \n\nWish I had the money for alcohol or drugs so I could numb myself and lose my inhibitions so I could just fucking do it. I'm a fucking loser and a coward. The world doesn't need me.
