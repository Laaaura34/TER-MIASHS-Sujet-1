Sadly, life continues and I have obligations. I\u2019m trying so hard but existing alone is hard\u2026 it takes all my energy. It wasn\u2019t this bad before. I had reasons to stay alive and I chose to stay so that I wouldn\u2019t hurt the people in my life. But as I slip deeper and deeper into my depression they all seem to not matter. I think \u201chey they\u2019ll get over it eventually\u201d. Every day I just wake up and it feels like I\u2019m waiting for something. I just realized that I\u2019m just waiting to die. I\u2019m not going to harm myself because I\u2019m honestly too mentally exhausted to deal with what that entails. I\u2019m just\u2026 here. I think if I ever went to do it I would think about the people I would devastate and decide against it. But I\u2019m not happy. I have never been happy. Nothing excites me nothing interests me. Nothing motivates me. I have started disassociating on purpose to pass the time when I\u2019m doing things that take effort. Sometimes I do it while I\u2019m working on an assignment so that I don\u2019t have to actually experience doing it\u2026 if you know what I mean? I\u2019m no longer interested in what I\u2019m in school for so I have zero motivation to even do the assignments but I do\u2026 when I think of dying the idea of it feels peaceful\u2026 it feels like a giant weight off my shoulders. Anyways, I am here because I don\u2019t want to hurt others but at my own expense. A couple of months ago I saw first hand what suicide does to those left behind\u2026 and I can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t know what the hell to do. I have a therapist and someone who loves and supports me. I have friends and finally cut my toxic parents off for good. I used attribute my depression to that fact that I couldn\u2019t find a relationship that worked out or that wasn\u2019t abusive. Now I have someone who wants to share a life with me, have a family and this relationship is all I\u2019ve ever wanted. The only thing I\u2019ve ever been sure of my whole life was that I wanted a family. It used to be my only reason for living. I should feel better because I have so many things I used to yearn for. But now that I have these things I\u2019ve realized that I still feel empty I still feel lonely if anything I feel worse than before. Life doesn\u2019t interest me and living feels like a burden and thinking about it both fills me with dread and anxiety. I mo longer care about having a family. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s circumstantial\u2026 it\u2019s just me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7823n/alive_out_of_guilt/", "title": "Alive out of guilt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Numerous-Aside0830", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634120059, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7823n/alive_out_of_guilt/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426172.6660786, "replies_charged": false}
