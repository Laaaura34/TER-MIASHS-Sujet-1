I started feeling a lot better and my outlook on my life was better than ever considering the year I had. I\u2019ve been going to therapy (have an appointment tomorrow) and getting my life together these past 2 weeks have been building up to a breakdown of some sort. I called the suicide prevention hotline for a little clarity and it grounded me as my breakdown has paused.\n\nEverything was going so well that I can\u2019t help but think what went wrong for me to be going back down this rabbit hole again. Some advice or words of encouragement are greatly appreciated.\n\nthank you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7qgpw/i_think_im_getting_to_a_bad_place_again_not_sure/", "title": "i think I\u2019m getting to a bad place again, not sure how to stop.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sadsebastianstangirl", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634178669, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7qgpw/i_think_im_getting_to_a_bad_place_again_not_sure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427881.2521112, "replies_charged": false}
