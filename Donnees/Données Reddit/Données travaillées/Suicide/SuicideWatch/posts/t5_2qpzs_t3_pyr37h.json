And this was that job. \n\nI\u2019ve been struggling financially for months and having constant panic attacks about barely barely scraping by every paycheck. I have debt from my credit card that seems to just fill up the same amount I pay off every month. I don\u2019t enjoy doing anything anymore and I literally cannot function or make decisions for myself unless I have someone directing me. \n\nI\u2019ve just cut up my ankles quite badly in the initial \u201clost-ness\u201d feeling after that phone call. I feel like I have absolutely nothing to live for. I love my boyfriend and my dog and my 2 close friends. But that\u2019s it. And honestly I\u2019ve come to these crossroads of being on the verge of overdosing myself on my meds until my dog comes over and I realize I\u2019d never want him to be abandoned because I did something so selfish. \n\nMy dog is my everything. He\u2019s been the only thing to stop me from killing myself so many times over now. \n\nHe\u2019s sitting next to me right now and has calmed me down enough to write this and ask for help. Healthcare here is nonexistent and I\u2019ve been on a mental health waitlist for over 2 years now. \n\nI spent some time after self harming to look for jobs but it just created more stress because I realized I don\u2019t have many options and I can\u2019t be in a job I despise or else I\u2019ll perform poorly and lose it. \nBut I also can\u2019t be picky or else I\u2019m going to end up without anywhere to live. \n\nI feel horrible because I just want the constant fearing for my quality of life to stop. I\u2019m constantly in the state of \u201cI wasn\u2019t enough to even do something this small and now I could lose everything because of it\u201d and the only thing stopping me from being a disgusting piece of shit who\u2019s willing to end it all and make others suffer for my actions is that I\u2019m worried about my dog. \n\nI literally could never express how much he means to me and how much he\u2019s helped me through. I have nightmares constantly about him dying and I wake up in a full blown panic attack because of it. \n\nI\u2019d be fully comfortable dying if I didn\u2019t worry about him. I can\u2019t have kids so I\u2019ve always viewed him as my own. I struggle to go through with it because I\u2019m so scared knowing he won\u2019t be taken care of the way I do. He\u2019s my best friend. No one knows me or him like we know each other. No one will know his quirks like how he needs to be praised the whole time to eat, he will make himself puke in the morning if he doesn\u2019t get cuddled for 20 minutes because he thinks I\u2019m upset with him, he has this one dense spot of curly hair under his ear that he loves having pet, he doesn\u2019t understand body language of other dogs to the point he\u2019s almost been attacked when trying to greet them and all he can think is \u201cthis is a potential friend!\u201d, he watches TV but certain animation styles cause him to panic, he likes his ears to be rubbed when you\u2019re telling him about your day, he won\u2019t eat new food unless he sees you take a bite first, he won\u2019t drink tap water or room temp water, he chews on my thumb to help himself calm down or sleep, etc. \n\nI\u2019m just so stuck. I feel like I have nothing going for me in my life, I can\u2019t find jobs that pertain to my skill level in the field I want more than anything to work in, I\u2019m suicidal, and every time I think things get better- it ends up worse than last time things went south. \n\nCan someone talk to me, console me, give me advice, distract me, anything please. \n\nI tried to cut deeper and in more lethal spots but my dog kept licking at my hands and I didn\u2019t want to push him or yell at him because I know he thinks he is helping me. \n\nMy next method now that I\u2019m calmer would be my medication. \n\nI\u2019m not scared of myself for these thoughts, just trying to hold on for my dog\u2019s sake. I\u2019m really trying.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pyr37h/i_need_help_i_feel_like_im_out_of_options_please/", "title": "I need help. I feel like I\u2019m out of options.
