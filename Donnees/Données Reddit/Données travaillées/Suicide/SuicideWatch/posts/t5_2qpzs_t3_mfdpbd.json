She is deeply depressed and dealing with health anxieties that are more like terrors. She has been saying that she doesn't want to live anymore but that she wouldn't kill herself. Today she said that she wanted to kill herself but that she doesn't know how. She did make a confusing reference to one mode of suicide that I hadn't heard of before, which makes me wonder if she has a plan. \n\nShe lives with a husband and child who don't understand mental health issues and are not supportive. I've convinced her to see a psychiatrist in a couple of days. Every day until the appointment will be a huge struggle to get her not to cancel it. She is terrified of everything right now and paralyzed with indecision.\n\nToday's conversation scared me. I'm not sure if this is the right forum, but my question is: was this enough of a red flag for me to try to escalate the situation to her family? She does have a sibling in another country. It's not that long now until she sees the psychiatrist, but if she is getting worse.....\n\nThank you for any advice you can offer.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mfdpbd/when_to_go_into_emergency_intervention_mode/", "title": "When to go into emergency intervention mode", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "crinklyplant", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616977481, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mfdpbd/when_to_go_into_emergency_intervention_mode/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426639.0822394, "replies_charged": false}
