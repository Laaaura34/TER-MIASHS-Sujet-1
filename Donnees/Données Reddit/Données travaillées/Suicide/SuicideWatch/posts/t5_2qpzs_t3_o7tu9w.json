Short of breath and extremely fatigued. The ones who are going to pass away soon. That young male with Crohn\u2019s and severe anorexia on NG tube sleeping all day. That old lady after liver resection who severely decompensated and now sleeps all day. One day I hope to be you\u2014I wish I could tell you how lucky you are. You are in a far better place than I am. \n\nAll of this reminds me of one of the most basic and fundamental facts of life\u2014consciousness is a curse.\n\nSevere physical pain and lethargy would distract me\u2014I want to be so tired and sick as shit so I could forget about my OCD. And the thought of death gives me so much joy, I fantasize so much about getting ESRD and skipping on my dialysis. I recently started smoking (like 2 weeks ago) and I wished the cigarette boxes I bought would have pictures of people in ventilators and in critical condition (like in Europe cigarette boxes) to remind me that cigarettes cause severe disease\u2014I fantasize about it and would love if my box had those images. One day I will die and nothing can possibly help me cope more than knowing I will die. Indeed, consciousness is the most disgusting and reprehensible curse that could ever exist.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o7tu9w/im_a_medical_student_studying_to_be_a_doctor_my/", "title": "I\u2019m a medical student studying to be a doctor: my patients are some of the luckiest people in the world.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Monkey__Shit", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624646719, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o7tu9w/im_a_medical_student_studying_to_be_a_doctor_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422264.9621086, "replies_charged": false}
