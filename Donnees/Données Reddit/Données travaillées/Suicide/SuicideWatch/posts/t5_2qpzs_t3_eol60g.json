I want to help, but I've talked to him trying to be encouraging before and he was like \"no offense but you don't really know me.\" Which is true. My boyfriend and I started dating a year ago and though his parents like me, I'm still trying to bond with his siblings. I've been in a deep depression before but I am much better and on SSRI's. Despite my own melancholy experiences, I am still having trouble deciphering how to reach out. Is there anything I can do to help him open up to me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-concerned", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/eol60g/my_boyfriends_brother_is_suicidal/", "title": "My boyfriend's brother is suicidal...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bravegirl900", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1579007992, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/eol60g/my_boyfriends_brother_is_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427542.3154204, "replies_charged": false}
