The logistics of your life are less than ideal, but you're lucky enough to have mental health care coverage and caring parents of meaningful financial capacity.\n\nWhat do you think are the important next steps? The \"you\" I employed, if it's not obvious, is largely rhetorical: this is more or less the situation I find myself in. The acute crisis has waned, but I gotta use the resources that I'm fortunate enough to have (qualified therapist & psychopharmacologist; aforementioned parents; some smart, caring friends; mental health care coverage) wisely to try to make life feel less painful and more worth living.\n\nAll comments will be appreciated. Or at least most. Commenters with advice about acquiring a spiritual or religious foundation need not apply; I'm afraid I'm one of 'em reddit hardlining atheists, and that's not going to change any sooner than my height or eye color.\n\nThanks.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/clzot/what_do_you_do_after_a_suicidal_crisis/", "title": "What do you do after a suicidal crisis?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "elusive_will", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1278289126, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/clzot/what_do_you_do_after_a_suicidal_crisis/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426125.5565298, "replies_charged": false}
