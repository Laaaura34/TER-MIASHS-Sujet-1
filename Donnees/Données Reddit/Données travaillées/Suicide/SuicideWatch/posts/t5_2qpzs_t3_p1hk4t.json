I think either the helium tank was too small or I accidentally let some air in my exit bag. It was not a pleasant experience, felt kinda suffocated and left being super dizzy hours after my attempt. \n\nI still have few days before I have to move out of the country I\u2019m in due to visa issues during the pandemic. Should I attempt again? \n\nI really don\u2019t want to move back to my parents house, they are really narcissistic. I have been controlled, emotionally abused and traumatised since I was a child. The rent in my home country is super expensive so I can\u2019t afford to move out again. And I cannot travel back to the country I\u2019m in now  because of Covid. \n\nWhat should I do? Should I order another helium tank or any suggestions to easier suicide methods that won\u2019t cause a lot of pain but guarantee success?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p1hk4t/failed_suicide_attempt_should_i_try_again/", "title": "Failed suicide attempt, should I try again??", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Master-Map4080", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628567744, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p1hk4t/failed_suicide_attempt_should_i_try_again/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428564.9388793, "replies_charged": false}
