They also have messaged all of my ex partners when i was with them and tried to ruin my relationship by calling me derogatory names and saying i was using them. \n\nIf i tell my parents i was fired they will go back to abusive ways and possibly kick me out and i will be homeless. \n\nI just need to know if i mixed these two with alcohol if i would die? \n\nI'm scared of heights so i can't jump and i fail at cutting myself due to having a tattoo which it's stunning and i can't ruin", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q3tlrv/idk/", "title": "idk", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Geroldtheonewhogives", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633681965, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q3tlrv/idk/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635427400.4856644, "replies_charged": false}
