I'm a piece of shit.\n\nIt's night time now in my country. I live with my girlfriend. I knew since december that she'd be out this week for work reasons, so I've been \"accidentally\" leaving our kitchen's gas on for the last month so she'd believe this is an accident and to avoid making anyone feel guilty. \n\nI made my decision but I thought I'd be serene and I'm scared out of my mind. I'd appreciate any words of support for my decision. I don't want to play victim, because as you'll soon understand I totally deserve this.\n\nI started going to psychotherapy 6 months ago for anxiety. What started as the \"normal\" sessions I expected, ended up with me being diagnosed as a sociopath. My psychologist helped me see that I use and hurt people constantly and make them dependent of me. I always seek to have power over people whenever i have a social interaction. I feel I \"own\" certain people and make them feel bad or guilty whenever they do anything I don't like. \n\nAs an example, I made my girlfriend cry with just a dreadful attitude when she died her hair of a color I disliked without asking me. Or when she caught me one of the many times I cheated on her since we started dating 4 years ago, I made her feel she was at fault and apologise for \"not caring for me enough to keep me loyal\". \n\nI didn't ever think twice about what I did, but my psychologist kept prodding, making me question myself. 2 months ago it came to me in one of our sessions. They usually last 1h, but that day I was her last patient and we spent 3h in total. I just realized. I realized what I make other people feel, I realized all the hurt that I cause, I just saw crystal clear how I'm just so unworthy of the life I have and the wonderful, caring, loving friends and girlfriend I have. \n\nI broke down crying and couldn't talk for over 10 minutes. I told my therapist I wanted to die. She said I had taken a huge step that day. That I could get over it and be a normal person. That it wasn't my fault. She said I became this way to protect myself after being sexually abused and physically beaten by my dad most of my childhood while my mum just let it happen. That there was something good in me and we could work to bring it out.\n\nBut I can't just put all the blame on my parents and play the victim. I can't live with myself anymore. I really hurt some good people...\n\nThe gas is on right now. My small kitchen is connected to the living room. It's a small, 45m2 flat with 2 rooms. The windows and the door to the dining room are shut. I'm going to take a bunch of fever meds that make me super sleepy as soon as I post this. I hope I won't even notice. I'll leave Netflix on, to further make this look like an accident. I even cooked something today that justified me using all 4 fires in the kitchen and told my girlfriend about it so it will make sense if they find that they are all on. If I caused so much pain in my life at least I want to go without making people feel guilty...\n\nIf you can just say anything that will help me stay calm in this last stretch I will be so thankful... I'm shivering. Fuck. I'm such a pussy. But I'm doing it tonight. Now.\n\nI wont answer comments because this is a throwaway and I'm logging out after posting because I dont want to leave evidences of my suicide in my phone. But I will read them until the meds kick in. No one will know because my phones battery will die in 3 or 4 hours and the app will close. \n\nThanks and goodbye.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ljafei/im_doing_it_now_im_scared/", "title": "I'm doing it now.
