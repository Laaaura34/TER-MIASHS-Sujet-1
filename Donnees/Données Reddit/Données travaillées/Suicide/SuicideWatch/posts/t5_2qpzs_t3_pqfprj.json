All of my friends are getting jobs and scholarships and going to colleges and have people who love them. I am a fucking idiot who sits inside all day to make art nobody cares about, write stories nobody cares about. I only do those things because if I don\u2019t I have nothing. When the thrill of thinking people care about my characters dies down I chug energy drinks and play a videogame to pass time. When I run out of trashy energy drinks I obsessively slash at myself to feel an ounce of something more. \nI don\u2019t even really want to go to college but I know I have to (in my community that\u2019s pretty much the only way to get anywhere). I don\u2019t really want a future. I used to be a straight A student with a bright future, most people see me as that still, but I lie and cheat to make it seem like I still got everything together. I want to kill my self more than I\u2019ve wanted anything right now I want to hurt I want to die.\n\nI have nothing left. Why can\u2019t I just raid my cabinet for pills whats stopping me. \nI wish I could just kill my self already so people can finally see how much pain I\u2019ve been in. Why do they never see how much pain I\u2019m in. I want to fucking die I want to fucking die so bad.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqfprj/im_a_dead_end_fucking_loser/", "title": "I\u2019m a dead end fucking loser", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "0905Tomato", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631939164, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqfprj/im_a_dead_end_fucking_loser/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425482.496361, "replies_charged": false}
