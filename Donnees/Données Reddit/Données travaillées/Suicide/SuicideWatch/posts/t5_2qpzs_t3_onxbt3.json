I know ive made a comment or 2 in the past im sure about it but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u2026 \nRecently I realized though that I\u2019ve sorta become an asshole with it.. not too proud of that one.    I\u2019ll throw things like \u201calright, well I\u2019m gonna go eat a bullet now\u201d or \u201csure lemme just go walk into traffic first\u201d into my daily life without even realizing what I\u2019m saying or to who (my mother).  To me thinking about it and fantasizing various ways to do it have become soothing in its own morbid way but that\u2019s no reason for me to throw it out there so much.  I\u2019ve also noticed i have no real inner monologue too anymore\u2026 thoughts don\u2019t seem to stay up there where they belong and just kinda come out without any regard to how others may feel about it.  Idk, maybe I\u2019m just slowly going crazy.  But i do know my inner asshole tendencies have begun affecting my life so i think it\u2019s time i finally cave in and go to talk to someone professional\u2026 fml \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb \nIdk, thoughts???
