I\u2019m a 25 year old female who just doesn\u2019t see my life getting any better. I literally go to bed dreading waking up and wake up paralyzed by the anxiety of having to make it through another day. The last 2 weeks has seen me spiral back into old habits I thought I was becoming free of. I suffer from eating disorders and I\u2019ve started binging and purging again to cope with the immense pain I feel inside. I\u2019ve hidden it from my family because I know of they find out they\u2019ll start locking all the cupboards, pantry and fridge, stop letting me have any access to money, take away my car, basically leave my life even more empty than it already is. It feels like bulimia is all I\u2019ve got to live for anymore even though it makes my life a living hell. I\u2019m attending a day program (though it\u2019s online atm due to covid) for my eating disorder but outside of that my life\u2019s gone to shit. I have no job and no motivation to do anything. I pretty much just want to lay on the floor and die each day my brain overwhelms me with thoughts of suicide and how much of a burden I am on my family. I\u2019ve had this disease since I was 12 and it\u2019s made me do some fucked up things. I\u2019m so ashamed of myself for the person I\u2019ve been and the things I\u2019ve done, last year I blocked up the gutter in our street with my vomit as I couldn\u2019t do it in the toilet as my family would find out, we had to get the council out to unblock it I was so fucking humiliated. I\u2019ve stolen food as I had no money for food to binge purge. I\u2019ve lied to my family and at times health professionals to cover up the disorder. Plus there\u2019s just a bunch of other shit I\u2019m disgusted in myself for. Last year my relationship ended with my boyfriend who I thought was the love of my life. I feel like a complete idiot now and blame myself for the abuse I endured from him. He suffers from a drug addiction and mental health issues but he understood me well. I gave him everything I had but it wasn\u2019t enough. And now I\u2019m left with trauma I can\u2019t erase. I\u2019ll never be the same again after what I went through with him. Anyway I just wanted to end this by saying I hope my life ends soon because I don\u2019t know how much longer I can physically and mentally take this pain. I believe in God but don\u2019t understand why he lets me suffer so much. I know I\u2019ve been a bad person but I haven\u2019t always been. I feel for everyone else out there suffering too.
