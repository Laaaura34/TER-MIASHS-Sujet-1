While looking up \u2018suicide hotline\u2019 on this sub Reddit it seemed like those phone numbers were specifically if you are in the middle of a crisis and while I\u2019m not in an immediate crisis, it feels like I could end up in one very quickly if I don\u2019t vent some of this out. Is there a phone number where they will let you vent without it being a full on emergency or do I have to wait until it inevitably gets to that point? It really needs to be a phone call not a typing situation though cause I\u2019ve just got too much to say and typing feels almost unbearable right now.\n\nLast night it was bad enough I actually began to carry out a plan but didn\u2019t get very far before wussing out due to being afraid of what would happen if it didn\u2019t work the way it was supposed to (life-long injury or brain damage etc). Today I was feeling somewhat better but I\u2019m getting in my head too deep and honestly it just feels like I need to vent and get this stuff so it\u2019s not replaying over and over and BECOMES a crisis.\n\nEdit: First, I wanted to add, even if you\u2019re not seeing this post till days later, please still feel free to post a phone number if you know one! You never know when someone else might come across it and need it. \n\nSecond, I rambled about my personal stuff before getting to the actual question so I cut and pasted said question above the personal rant since the personal stuff isn\u2019t really necessary.\n\nEdit 2: spelling", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nvgtcg/hotline_for_when_youre_suicidal_but_not_to_the/", "title": "Hotline for when you\u2019re suicidal but not to the point you\u2019re in a full blown crisis, yet.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "WillAccomplished6970", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623192356, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nvgtcg/hotline_for_when_youre_suicidal_but_not_to_the/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426134.5646, "replies_charged": false}
