Through this time I\u2019ve made many new friends and reconnected with old ones. I thought so low of myself for so long, I would tell myself anything and I still think most of what I thought was true. I would cut myself and give into depression hoping it would be enough to finally put me over the edge and follow through with the suicide I\u2019ve had planned since November of 2020. I\u2019ve learned many things about myself, life, friends, and peoples emotions. I am so grateful for the opportunities I\u2019ve had in my life, there\u2019s people that would do anything for these opportunities and I\u2019ll always be grateful. I\u2019ve worked to be the best person I can and I can honestly say I am not who I was last year, I still hate myself for the way I used to be and I deserve that it\u2019s my karma. I\u2019ve tried to be there for my friends since my attempt and I have been. I love them all so much as well as everyone in my life, I wish I had done more in my life to be successful I might of stayed if I did. I just want everyone to be happy and feel fulfilled with their lives, I\u2019d give everyone my serotonin if I could. I did finally get to a point a few weeks ago to where I finally felt completely comfortable, happy, confident, and excited for my life. There\u2019s many other things but unfortunately I cannot stay here much longer, I thought I would die sad but now I will go with dignity and a heart full of love and compassion, I\u2019m just so grateful. I have pills I\u2019ve been amassing and I\u2019m not ready to let them go, I know it doesn\u2019t all make sense but one day it will for the people in my life. Thank you so much for this time it\u2019s meant the world too me, when like this I look at the sky and appreciate what\u2019s around me while I can. When I\u2019m not here I want to be everything around, the grass, trees, air, clouds, everything that can be enjoyed. Once again thank you so much, I feel now like I can finally go in peace and become so much more. This will be my last post, good luck everyone I wish the best.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o1skr6/thank_you/", "title": "Thank you", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "primecutm", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 35, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623920022, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o1skr6/thank_you/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423017.2194142, "replies_charged": false}
