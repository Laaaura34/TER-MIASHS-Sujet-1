I spent years in psychiatric care but was wrongly diagnosed and never got the help I needed. \nI was bullied and abused as a kid, I was extremely bright and sensitive and high hopes and a huge appetite for life. After I burned out it completely went away. Even if I could have it all I still wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy it because my brain is destroyed from trauma. Severe memory problems, emotional dysregulation that shifts sometimes several times a second. Chronic insomnia. It\u2019s never ending. \nI\u2019m incapable of doing mundane everyday tasks that can pass time\n\nMy life has been constructed to isolate me in the most profound way and I lost the ability to occupy myself with areas of interest because of chronic anxiety\n\nI started having breakdowns where I scream in despair and wake up neighbours who calm the police.\n\nIt\u2019s happened so many times I know the staff who arrive and today we even cut things short because they know there\u2019s nothing that can be done\n\nI can\u2019t cope with the disappointment of what my life has become. \n\nI used to be a singer\nI haven\u2019t sung in ten years and my fits of rage have destroyed my vocal chords. I can\u2019t even hum to myself without triggering anxiety \n\nsevere ADHD ( medication doesn\u2019t work, it usually ends in anhedonia and uncontrollable rage attacks, ASD, burnout syndrome, seasonal depression, tinnitus, ptsd, narcissistic personality disorder, hiv positive, I was wrongly diagnosed with borderline and I have been denied the social care and therapy for years because I\u2019m labelled as a hopeless case\n\nI\u2019ve never been able to work, I didn\u2019t finish school. I used to have too grades and I have rare artistic talents and a deep understanding of art and science but I\u2019ve never been able to build a context where I belong. I\u2019m alone all the time, I often can\u2019t even listen to music because of the sensory overload.\n\nI am so scared of dying but I have no realistic reasons to think this will ever change and I can tell I\u2019ve gone far in the process of pushing myself to the edge and finally kill myself.\n\nI never have energy to do anything, I feel like I spent the last 20 years waiting for a bus that never arrives. \n\nThese days when I call my parents I end up screaming intelligibly outof sheer desperation and I dissociate. \n\nI can\u2019t even externalise curiosity of the world because how the system destroyed me and how the planet is dying.\n\nI am chronically depressed in a way where I\u2019m incapable of falling in love and meeting someone. I lost so many friends and opportunities. I wouldn\u2019t even have been able to fantasise life would become so painful. The envy makes me physically nauseous and hyperventilate. \n\n\nI wanted to live but this life is never going to be good enough. What I need to sustain balance always overwhelms me and leaves me in deep fatigue.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/odxbi1/this_is_my_story/", "title": "This is my story", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "arasharfa", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625448950, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/odxbi1/this_is_my_story/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426583.2446008, "replies_charged": false}
