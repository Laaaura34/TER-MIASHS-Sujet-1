This was all done to me by my family. I\u2019m biracial Asian and white and my white American family stole me from Asia and abused me, and didn\u2019t allow me to continue to speak mandarin/Hakkanese, nor see my Asian family. My white mother stole me and she literally had a white husband waiting for me when she stole me from my real father. I was then designated as a victim of abuse and Cinderella. They had their own biological child and I became a maid for her too. This all happened in the early 90s. I\u2019m in my 30s now. I\u2019ve been called pretty all my life but I didn\u2019t understand this til recently / I never looked in the mirror much because it brought up PTSD CPTSD. I look so much more like my father than my mother. I couldn\u2019t bare to look at myself. I\u2019m realizing I\u2019ve been a people pleaser and a servant my whole life. I can\u2019t stand looking at myself. I can\u2019t stand being alive and I tried to call mental health facilities but they\u2019re all focused on substance abuse. I need mental help.
