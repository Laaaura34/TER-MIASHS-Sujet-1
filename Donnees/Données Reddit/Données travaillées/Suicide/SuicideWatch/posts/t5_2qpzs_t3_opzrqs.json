I've had multiple attempts and a recent one that destroyed my physical body in that I have multiple injuries that limit me. This was to escape an abuser in the moment (not planned)\n\nI recently was broken up with and my friends (not close friends as I have never had any) aren't there for me. I have no one. I have been estranged From family for nearly 10 years. \n\nI'm on the verge of completing suicide. I've cried out to the system and tried many techniques for my own benefit that is not medication as I'm too sensitive to side effects. \n\nI just can't cope with the daily fluctuations and severe emotional agony each day. I have no one to hug, to cry with, to laugh with etc. \n\nI'm desperate. I'm convinced I will end my life this weekend. I've put all the hard work in. I have. I know that is something that needs maintenance but my illness is winning. \n\nAnyone know what this is like? I know I cannot rely on another human to make it all better as that is the same as looking for drugs or an external thing to sort out the internal and it isn't reliable. I wish I had support around me but I don't.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/opzrqs/chronic_suicidal_ideation_and_urges_will_this_be/", "title": "Chronic suicidal ideation and urges.
