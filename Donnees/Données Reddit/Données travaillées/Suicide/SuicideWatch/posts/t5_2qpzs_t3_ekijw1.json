I should be strong, pull myself together, keep going. In less than a month i should move out, go to evening school and work at the same time. I should move into an apartment with people who have no idea about my problems. The apartment is 3 hours away from my hometown, by train. And i get nothing on the line, i'm not responsible, i suffer from my eating disorder (formerly anorexia, now atypical bulimia) and depression. I was in the ED clinic until mid-November, but somehow it didn't help. I hate myself so much. I feel hopeless and empty. I don't really want to kill myself, but I want to die, to vanish.  Sometimes I wish that a car would run over me or that I would fall down the stairs and break my neck. Ups, it was an accident. God, it's all too much and too tiring. Please, can someone end it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ekijw1/my_brain_screams_aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/", "title": "My brain screams: AAaaaAaaAaAAAaAAaAAA", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "marysaccount", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1578255981, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ekijw1/my_brain_screams_aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422952.5014403, "replies_charged": false}
