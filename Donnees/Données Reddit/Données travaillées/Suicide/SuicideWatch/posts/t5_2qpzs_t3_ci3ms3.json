Had 4 suicidal crisis in the last 2 weeks s I wanna organize a sleepover with all my friends to prove my brain i am not alone. I was even thinking of making a cute invitation like when we were kids (i am 22 )  i want to write a text to send with the invitation explaining that i ve been feeling really bad and that i want to have all the important people for me there with me to have a good time. I dont know how to write it in a way they dont feel like they are obligated but that they understand this is so important to me that i ll really feel sad if they dont come. I know i will fee less important if they dont come. Also some activities that dont include alcohol cause it makes me have panick attacks. I just want it to be a safe place for me. \n\nI am already sad thinking no one will come", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ci3ms3/restraint_sleepover/", "title": "Restraint sleepover", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MarieAngellique", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1564151749, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ci3ms3/restraint_sleepover/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426140.3044941, "replies_charged": false}
