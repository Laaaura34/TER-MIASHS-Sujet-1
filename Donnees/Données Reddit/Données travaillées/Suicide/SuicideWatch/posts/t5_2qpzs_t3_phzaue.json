I\u2019m a kissless virgin. I\u2019ve never even tried. I\u2019m good looking and tall but I can\u2019t muster up any courage in themself and what kind of woman would want a guy with no social life who sees himself as a worthless piece of shit. I\u2019ve just had an extreme urge to kill myself after seeing someone who was considered the biggest loser in the school years ago with a group of popular people. I can\u2019t go on. I\u2019ve fought for a year but it\u2019s time to give it up now. Things don\u2019t get better, some people aren\u2019t cut out for life. I feel almost at peace now , almost. I\u2019ve left the house in preparation and I\u2019m typing as I walk. Close to the destination.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m okay, I couldn\u2019t go through with it. I sat on the cliff top for a while with the wind blowing in my hair looking out to sea and it felt like the right time to go but I felt a strange sense of calmness. I cried for a while and decided to go home. Got in and slept for 11 hours and just woke up now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/phzaue/im_going_to_kill_myself_in_16_minutes/", "title": "I\u2019m going to kill myself in 16 minutes", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "brokenloser712839", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 95, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630788288, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/phzaue/im_going_to_kill_myself_in_16_minutes/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425315.9555929, "replies_charged": false}
