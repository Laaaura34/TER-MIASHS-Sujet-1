I was never good enough for them. same with my parents. I have dreams about them killing me in the most gore way and then being all sad. it's disgusting.\n\nI saw A yesterday and will see my therapist tomorrow and that's the only thing I that I think about beside how I'm actually gonna check out. imma try for them two today.\n\nI only hurt everyone anyway. they will actually be better off without me in the long run. cause I'm too much to handle. I'm too big of a headache.\n\nthank you for letting me vent.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbebkm/i_hate_how_everyone_will_be_the_sad_one_after_my/", "title": "i hate how everyone will be the sad one after my death", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tacohann", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634658568, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbebkm/i_hate_how_everyone_will_be_the_sad_one_after_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426740.125326, "replies_charged": false}
