There isnt if everyone and everything is replaceable and I'm going to spend the rest of my life chasing off boredom in various ways. I dont care about others, I dont care about myself. I've just expelled the only other reason I was trying to live, so now I dont have a point.\n\nI think I will the day after I graduate. That will be when I hit a turning point. I'll have known what my worth is from an academic perspective, based on which universities accept me, and I wont have a use for anyone around me. \n\n\nI dont know why I'm writing this post. Maybe as a reminder or something? Whatever. I've made up my mind now.
