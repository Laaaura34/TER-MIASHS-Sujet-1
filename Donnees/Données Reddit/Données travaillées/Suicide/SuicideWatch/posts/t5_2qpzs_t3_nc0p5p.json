I'm 17, been through a fair bit, nothing too crazy I would like to believe, although I know you might take it as an understatement. I was born in Cali Colombia, South America. My Mom was 17, my dad 23. Dont worry it wasnt statuary rape, teenagers have sexual urges too you know? Its fairly common for this type of relationship to happen, especially outside the US. I was conceived into a broken family, broken home. I dont think they were ever truly together, then again my dad cheated on her while she was pregnant so color me surprised. She left colombia to come to work in the US. I was left with my father, and he was my one true friend, apart from being my dad also. Had a few stepmothers, dad was a player. I guess I was always smart, straight A's, honor roll, private schools. I was taught values, and understood complex concepts from a young age. I remember I used to save coins in a piggy bank, my dad's wisdom. I was taught the importance of being proactive and self aware. Trust me this plays a big role later into what this will be, a long story. I didnt know my mother, she left me for the first ten years of my life. I come to the US to \"study\" and live with someone I was meant to call mother, but ended up being a raging drunk with vulgar tendencies. I wouldnt say shes a bad person, but then again my vision is narrow, and I only know her as the angry woman she is, maybe that's just life. I was normal I guess, chunky, nerdy, but wasnt socially awkward or anything. It wasnt until highschool that shit kinda hit the fan, although instead of it being a turd it was my perception of reality, and instead of a fan it was a crushing realization. I had a smartphone, and to save myself the anguish I'll just be straight with it. I ended up downloading some pretty disgusting material by accident if you know what I'm saying, police raided my home, I went through the legal system as a juvenile, got treated like a predator. Not a pedo, I havent even become sexually active yet. These past 3 years or so have been, exhausting. I dont recognize myself. I came to the conclusion that life is hell, and it's our fault. For every time we ignore ignorance, for every time we turned our eyes away, we have allowed ourselves to fall into the pit we are. My mind works fast, and yet it doesn't feel like it does. As in, I find myself not smart, but instead life pretty stupid. It's so easy to fix racism, just restore the balance by giving wealth back to people of color, create generational wealth, ending stereotypes and therefore false beliefs of superiority over generations. It's so easy to fix human trafficking, just address the taboos of our society honestly and without sugarcoating, giving predators the help they need without demonizing them and making them go into hiding just to keep committing atrocities. It's so easy, and yet most of the population is ignorant or ironically, apathetic to it, just like me... so I guess I'm not that different. I have gone down the depths of the darkest of rabbitholes, hollywood running everything, silicone mask wearing actors portraying themselves as the rappers and celebrities we idolize, draconians, satanism, luciferianism which is commonly misunderstood as the same thing as satanism, it's actually the third eye and treating yourself like god. Studied some religion, politics, a lot. I came to a conclusion, it's not absolute, but it's what I Got so far into my young age. This world is hell, maybe not literally, but it feels like it. Lucifer just wanted to be as God, who has done more devilish deeds than the so called accuser we pin the blame of everything on. Omnipresent, omnipotent, all loving... I think not. My perception is limited, but I've heard enough. This world is hell. I have no more lingering attachments to this reality, I care not for the evil, I care not for the pure. Maybe if I knock on the door, it will be answered. Maybe with pain, maybe with bliss. I want to save this world, but this world doesn't want to be saved. I could follow in Nipsey's steps, become a role model, teach wealth and wisdom to my people. I could change this world... but I dont think I want to anymore. I just wish to marinate in my selfish existence. No pain, no joy, stillness. We dont know what's after this, but I'm yearning to find out. I dont think I'll do it, but I just might. Maybe then i wont have to resort to medicating my misery with the simpler Joys of life, like food, knowledge or pleasure.
