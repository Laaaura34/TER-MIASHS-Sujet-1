I have no job, no friends or any adventures to speak of. Almost all the memories i have always are from indoors.\n\nI've been manipulated, Threatened, abused,bullied, raped... abandoned and forgotten\n\nI am diagnosed with major depression and psychosis, Suffer from keratoconus\n\nIt really went down hill after i turned 26 and came to realized i wasted my life (Which i don't I have not lived a single day) Never experience teenage hood or early adult hood. Zero experiences... Ive dreamed of going out and living my life for once... But fear, it always beats me... What will people think? Will i fail? It scares me...\n\nI'm almost 30 and i havent lived life, i'm tired of it...\nI am tired of living like this and if i cant change it, i'd rather die already... I have no one who will miss me...\nMy uncle who i loved like a father and who was my only friend Died last year. My grandma suffers from dementia and even though she would hurt, She would quickly forget.. My mother is responsible for my horrible childhood (i take responsibility for my adult hood) My father chose to live far away from me and i havent spoken to him months. I havent spoken to my older sister in a year She wouldn't a damn\n\nI'm all alone... I've been crying non stop for 5 hours, convincing myself that i should just end it. It would be better to end it to live another day like this... I wish i would have never been born...
