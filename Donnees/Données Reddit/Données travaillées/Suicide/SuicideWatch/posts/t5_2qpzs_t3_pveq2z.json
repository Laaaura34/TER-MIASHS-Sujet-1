I have tried basically everything. Maybe I am just an a*whole who deserves to die. Maybe this is God\u2019s way of calling my soul back because he have other plans for me. Maybe not. I can not bear this pain anymore. I just want to sleep. I don\u2019t want to hurt my family but I also don\u2019t want to be alive just so that others don\u2019t have to feel guilty. I don\u2019t have a date yet but I know that if someone hurts me enough I am ready to go and buy a knife and a shit load of vodka. Kind of hope I don\u2019t die and also kind of hope that I will die. I just want the pain to end and I have tried everything but nothing helps. Maybe I don\u2019t want help. Maybe I just want to die. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know anything anymore except from that I can not bear this pain. My recent posts have not had that many comments so I guess no one in here is able to help either. I don\u2019t know why I am writing this.
