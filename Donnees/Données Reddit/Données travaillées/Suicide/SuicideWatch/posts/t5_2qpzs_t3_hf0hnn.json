A few months ago, someone I knew only slightly went missing one day and she left a suicide note, and it got me thinking about how I should be prepared. **I don\u2019t plan to do it anytime soon**, but I know that some day, unless I get hit by a car or something unexpected, I\u2019ll kill myself. In it I\u2019ve mentioned the recurring problems I\u2019ve had that I think I can expect to continue bothering me. I\u2019m confident that I\u2019d turn to drugs (like I have in the past) before killing myself, so I assumed that I\u2019d be using around the time of my death. I\u2019m making drawings on the backs of the pages because I\u2019m an artist and I want to leave something pleasant and meaningful behind.\u00a0\n\nI just want to know if there\u2019s anything I should change. Every day I\u2019m trying not to kill myself and I\u2019m getting help and have been for years. Think of this as harm reduction for my family, just for when it finally happens.\n\n**Anyway, here\u2019s the note:**\n\nI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s all just too difficult. Without the drugs, without the highs\u2014I can\u2019t do this. And with the drugs, there are the inevitable comedowns, which, I have found, always outweigh the highs. So either way, I come to the same conclusion: I can\u2019t do this. But it\u2019s not much I\u2019m missing. I wasn\u2019t going to be anything great. Or at least, I would never feel like anything great. And if nothing good reaches me\u2014if chronic despondency and cynicism will always get the best of me and continue to filter out any payoff of my misery\u2014then why waste the effort? No matter what would have happened in my life, had I kept living, I would have become numb to it with time and retracted back into my default melancholy. Everything always falls flat\u2014that is my experience. Excitement simply doesn\u2019t last for me, and the world is just so incredibly dull in my eyes. Life is monstrously ugly and unremarkable.\n\nFor some time, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be the type to leave a note. I\u2019m impulsive. I always thought that one day I\u2019d just be over it all and I\u2019d down some pills or cut an artery, and maybe scribble down a goodbye real quick, while bleeding or vomiting all over the paper. I thought it would pain me too much to think about my life and death within my last few hours of living, much less to write about it all. But I\u2019m a writer, and I figured it would be heedless and selfish to leave nothing behind. So I wrote this ahead of time. (I\u2019m sorry for any erroneous, vague, or inconsistent language.)\n\nI\u2019ve known this would happen for a while now, I just didn\u2019t know when. But I always knew one thing for sure: I could never let someone or something else claim my life. It\u2019s mine, so I get to end it. I don\u2019t feel that my life was given to me as a sort of gift; rather, it was imposed upon me. I was given this weird, demanding vessel of flesh to experience the universe through, and so much of my time and effort has gone into taking care of this stupid ugly thing that we call a \u201cbody.\u201d And on top of this tedious maintenance, other expectations must be met, and I feel the need to not only meet but exceed each one of these expectations. It\u2019s exhausting. Call me selfish or ungrateful, but that\u2019s how I feel, and I don\u2019t care who knows or who sees this. I\u2019m dead.\n\nPut me in a box that is just big enough for my body\u2014one that will quickly disintegrate, and do not embalm me. I refuse to be another ostentatious corpse in a stupid metal box clogging up the Earth with its selfish, arrogant body, leaking poison into the groundwater. I will decompose and there is no way around it. To slow or mask the process would be stupid. I should be no different than a bird who died and simply became a part of the Earth again.\n\nDon\u2019t be misled by the nature of my death\u2014life can be a beautiful thing. But beauty and happiness are not and have never been one in the same. When I was ten, it dawned on me that a life of great length would be meaningless if it meant happiness would have to be compromised. I wrote it on a piece of paper and put it in a locket I had. I meant to keep it until I died, but you know me\u2014I lose things\u2014so here\u2019s this instead. I had used the word \u201clove,\u201d not \u201chappiness,\u201d but the utilitarian sentiment was there. And I\u2019m doubtful that I have much left to experience that will be worth the painful waiting\u2014the spaces in between the sporadic moments of contentment and excitement; the spaces between the hope. Those quintessential moments have become increasingly transient, and I don\u2019t believe it would be reasonable to expect a comeback.\n\nThroughout my life, I\u2019ve been travelling through \u201cmindscapes,\u201d as I call them\u2014the different periods of my life. I visualize them, like landscapes. They can be comfortable, or they can be strange and unsettling, but sometimes, it seems that each new one is more horrible than the last, and life feels like a series of diminishing returns. I often find myself longing for the past, however miserable it may have been, and however well I may be doing at the moment. Comfortable familiarity seems to always be just out of reach. I\u2019ve been in an incredibly unpleasant mindscape lately. I\u2019m in no man\u2019s land again, and this time, I\u2019ve been gunned down. Life has always been a delicate thing, and it\u2019s finally shattered, but at least I didn\u2019t waste away slowly like so many do.\n\nSince I was very young, I\u2019ve felt terribly out of place. I often felt that I didn\u2019t fit anywhere in this world. And maybe I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen terrible things, not because of external circumstances, but because I have an immutable tendency to inflict pain upon myself. I\u2019ve seen crippling fear and hopelessness, unbearable comedowns, and my own darting eyes. Age sixteen was infested with shadow rats and waking nightmares and utter confusion. There\u2019s little joy left. I\u2019m filled with malaise every second that my body remains in operation. I want to forget everything.\n\nI hate who I am, and it\u2019s not like the hatred I would feel for another person. Sure, I\u2019m horrendously ugly and burdensome, but more than that, I hate myself because I know myself too well. I\u2019m devoid of mystique in my eyes. I hate my face, my voice, my body, my name, and my mind, not necessarily because they\u2019re bad, but because they\u2019re mine. I\u2019m tired of them all. I can\u2019t live with myself any longer because it feels like there\u2019s something intrinsically bad about who I am.\n\nAnd the music\u2014it would never be enough. There\u2019s no need for secondhand regret, because I know for a fact that nothing is ever near as great as it seems, and unfortunately, the reverse of that is far from true. Things can be just as horrible as they appear. In fact, they can be far worse. Addiction is so much more harrowing than I could ever have imagined. Depression is tolerable, until it isn\u2019t anymore. Try and blame me for wondering why the hell I should decide to continue living when every day I\u2019m struck at least twice by a profound, seemingly incessant sadness, a sadness that is immune to ideal circumstances. In the morning I run to try to catch up, to make up for my sheer laziness and incompetence, but there\u2019s never enough time, and never enough drive. So I have to take out loans. And that comes in the form of drugs. I borrow happiness. I repay the universe periodically through the comedowns, but I fail to keep up with the payments\u2014I always fall short. I rack up debt, and that debt must be paid in the form of withdrawals. And the best way to avoid debt is to die. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nI am truly sorry to put you through this. I just couldn\u2019t continue. Everyone becomes disillusioned with time, and some experience it far sooner than others, and some are particularly tortured by it. I can\u2019t compartmentalize. I can\u2019t realize something profound and then just ignore it and continue living as though nothing has shifted within me. It\u2019s too much. Life just isn\u2019t for everyone. There are some people (like me) who have lost the capacity to appreciate things. I\u2019m unresponsive.\n\nI cannot speak to any of you directly here, because I think that would be too painful for all of us. I don\u2019t want to haunt you. I waited. I waited for years because I didn\u2019t want any of you to feel like I could\u2019ve been something, like I missed out on some grandiose opportunity. If someone doesn\u2019t have some meaningful direction by my age, what more can they really do? I\u2019ve always wanted to die young. I don\u2019t want to grow old and tired and stagnant. You know I love you. I don\u2019t need to tell you that, but I will. I love you. I love you so much. All of you. You know who you are. But I\u2019m too grotesque and sad and addicted to keep on living. I am sincerely sorry for any trauma I have caused you. I just can\u2019t think straight. I can\u2019t get anything to make sense. My head is screwed on all wrong, and I just want to cut it off\u2014revoke my brainstem.\n\nAnd I beg you, please don\u2019t cling to the memories. Nostalgia is and has always been nothing more than a terrible trap. Don\u2019t dwell on the past, because you\u2019ll only find yourself longing for something you can never have. And please know that there\u2019s nothing you could have done. Your lives must go on. When a person really wants to die, he or she will find a way. I doubt you could have stopped me. You are all doing your best. Be stoic (in the philosophical sense, not the colloquial sense) and know that I died content. There won\u2019t be a comedown for me this time. No crash, and no withdrawals. And I can assure you that comedowns and withdrawals are far worse than death. So suffer on your own behalf, not on mine. I was doomed to this from the beginning. There is no free will, and there is no changing your fate. So fucking live. Experience things. Don\u2019t bother buying more time for yourself if you don\u2019t intend to do anything valuable with it. There\u2019s nothing left for me, but the rest of you still have a place in the world. I was bound to off myself sooner or later. If you thought otherwise, you were dead wrong. How long could someone like me really be strong? If you can, be happy for me. I\u2019m okay now. I\u2019m forever incapable of suffering. I\u2019m done chasing and I\u2019m done waiting. I love you.
