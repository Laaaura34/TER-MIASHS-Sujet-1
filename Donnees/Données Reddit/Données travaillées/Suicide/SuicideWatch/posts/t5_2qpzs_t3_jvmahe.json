Once my mind finally lets go of one thing, it finds the next thing to worry about. Recently I\u2019ve been worrying about what kind of person I am. I know I\u2019m a good person, I have flaws like anyone else but my mind has this amazing way of just torturing me honestly. \n\nI recently got a new job & I\u2019m waiting to move forward in the hiring process. I\u2019m happy I\u2019ll finally have something to do with my time since I\u2019ve been out of work & school for months. I\u2019ve been working on rearranging my room & getting a new piece of furniture in. Today I didn\u2019t have much to do, I\u2019d gotten everything I wanted done for the time being. So, I watched YouTube almost all day. I ate with my family, spent time with them like I usually do. Rather than tell myself it\u2019s okay to have a lazy day & that I\u2019ve gotten quite a bit done recently, I fixate on what I did wrong. I spent way too much time on my phone, I was unproductive, I always seem to find something wrong with me even when I\u2019m trying so hard to be positive. The littlest things will send me into a dark spiral I haven\u2019t figured out how to get out of. For instance, I\u2019ll hear something on a show I\u2019m watching & start to feel guilty, wondering if I\u2019m guilty of doing this when I know I\u2019m not. I never used to be this way. What\u2019s wrong with me? Can anyone relate to this? Does anyone have any idea what this could be? Anxiety, depression, both ?\n\nThank you for reading \ud83d\udda4", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jvmahe/overthinking_has_really_started_to_take_a_toll_on/", "title": "Overthinking has really started to take a toll on me /:", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "xpurple-alienx", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605586173, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jvmahe/overthinking_has_really_started_to_take_a_toll_on/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428126.50163, "replies_charged": false}
