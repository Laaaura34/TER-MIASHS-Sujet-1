It\u2019s so important for people to be able to vent and not further stigmatized and alienated.\n\nI\u2019ve been going through an emotional rollercoaster with my husband who just abruptly left me and my suicidal ideations are almost exclusively tied to his treatment of me.\n\nI think it is sad in our society that people have to resort to really painful and extreme ways of dying. Physician assisted suicide should be allowed to people who are suffering.\n\nThis is more of a test post for venting and support, but what has helped you ?\n\nEdit : I haven\u2019t posted on Reddit often, but wanted to thank you for the kindness. I love you, Reddit \ud83d\udc95. Hope life treat you good before I slap it for you. To be in pain and still reach out to comfort me, who tf are you people.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cubgv9/i_want_a_guaranteed_painless_way_to_die/", "title": "I want a guaranteed painless way to die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hellobougey", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 53, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1566552424, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cubgv9/i_want_a_guaranteed_painless_way_to_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427165.9871309, "replies_charged": false}
