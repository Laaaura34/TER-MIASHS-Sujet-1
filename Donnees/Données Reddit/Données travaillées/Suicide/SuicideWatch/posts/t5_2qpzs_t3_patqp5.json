She comes out of the room and hands me a note saying \u201ci want to die, im thinking how to do it\u201d\n\nThis destroyed me. Is not the first shes has said \u201ci want to die\u201d\n\nOnce she calmed down i talked to her to seek treatment and medication (multiple occassions) but she says shes fine (she is trully fine, but i fear a next episode)\n\nI am a bit depressed of this as i am fearful she can escalate things and harm herself eventually and the thought of me not doing MORE to help. But don\u2019t know what else to do. I dont wanna force her either.\n  Suggestions?\n\nEdit: wow. Its incredible the amount of support that i have found here. Guys you are all golden for reaching out. May blessing fall upon you all. This group is amazing. I will contact a fee professionals to aid me with this situation and approach it the best we can THANK YOU! \nDon\u2019t give in guys. Life is really ugly but remember it has a beautiful side as well.
