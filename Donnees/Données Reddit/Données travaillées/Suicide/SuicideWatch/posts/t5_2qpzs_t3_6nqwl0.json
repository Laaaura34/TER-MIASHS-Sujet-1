I've gone to therapy for it at 3 different stages of my life and it's always disappointing. I can't control my mood shifting to juvenile levity, which complicates things. I've had intrusive suicidal thoughts for a year. I am considering SSRIs.\n\n***TL;DR is in all the bold text.***\n\n---\n\nI grew up hating overly-confident characters whose ignorance stemmed from hubris, so I have always thought self-doubt to be wise. Also, when I was young I started overeating and choosing to stay inside (games, internet) rather than exercising, socializing, or going outside in general.\n\nI deliberately punched myself in front of others in the second and third grade, most likely as a sort of penance, hoping I would associate pain with any problematic parts of my personality that may have caused internal or external friction. There are a few reasons for that...\n\nWith disdain for my own body/appearance and weight, **my laziness commingled with my self-hatred; one justified the other**, leading to a cycle of me thinking I'm wise for insulting myself for sitting on my ass all day which lead to more things to feel sad about. Comfort and leisure were my drug, and depression was my enabler. A separate fuel to the depression's fire were my two siblings, both older brothers, who I looked up to in different ways, but always socialized with each other more, generally did better in school and seemed to receive more valid praise for their various achievements according to my new negative internal narrative. Around them, I felt dumb and that my personal interests were of no value. I had a really bad habit of lying when I was young, and also was interested in more juvenile pursuits in terms of activities and entertainment, which seemed to cement the silent narrative in my family that I was the \"bad kid\" that I still believed even when I was getting all A's & B's in high school. Thankfully we've had our better moments but I still will never shake that nagging mental image, and it's what remains in my mind as we've grown apart as we've gotten older and had virtually no intimate social contact. A final piece of evidence for my internal allegations against myself is my lack of romantic development. I want to be in a loving intimate relationship like the majority of people on earth, but I never have. A key factor to my longing is a need for acceptance and validation by someone who is unlike myself, as that acceptance is the only one I would trust as **I do not respect myself enough to trust any self-love**.\n\nMy self-hatred became a subconscious gospel that was projected onto all my social thought processes from thereon. If someone has a reaction to me that was neutral, my brain will always find a way to interpret it as negative to at least fill in the gaps with mostly-false harmful information. As a result, almost all my social interactions became timid and apologetic, as **I fear others' responses will be negative, but that new timid behavior still pushes people away** with its general unease and weakness. I constantly fear/am curious about what others think of me and desperately want to know, but not enough to risk aggravating or alienating them in the process of finding out so if I ever try to find out I will only ever pursue it in the most indirect ways. I am very eager to receive constructive criticism, as I'm willing and able to stand corrected, but I rarely feel like I'm able to ask for any without inconveniencing or alienating others.\n\nThis key crystallization of 'extreme social anxiety and strong inner critic fueled by lack of self esteem' occurred alongside my continued normal development as an active young adult despite my large tendency of laziness. I would still love to spend time with friends and **I never really exhibited the real physical/activity-based symptoms of depression (lack of motivation to participate/engage/get out of bed), which is why I'm very hesitant to call what I have \"depression,\" but it's a convenient term which I may continue to use throughout these statements.**\n\n**My natural personality tends to be a lot more cheerful**, eager to make jokes (that mostly fall flat) and easily excitable. This is a stark contrast to the quiet, reserved, form of myself when I'm consumed by depressive thoughts. **This contrast makes it difficult for me to open up about my depression** as I feel I need to maintain that persona for their sake, but also makes me think it's difficult for my claims of depression to be taken seriously by people who know me as the funny one. I feel like I'm never in control of who I am, either. I would like to be a calm and logical amalgam of both levity and seriousness, but this random light switch keeps flicking the jokester's happiness on and off based on what context I'm in and who I'm around. I would not be surprised if this was largely due to any ADHD which my family has a history of, because of its similarity to the lack of self-control.\n\nMy general **lack of social interaction makes me feel stuck in this perpetual state of not living my life to its potential**, not sharing moments with others, not building character, not making anything of myself, and not having the social interaction I crave. I let my teenage-hood pass my by, by staying indoors and researching genres of music I was obsessed about or listening to podcasts that simulate jovial interaction between friends. You can only re-listen to 400+ episodes of a so many times while wasting time re-playing the same video games. Now, my newest form of escape is to try to make up for my lost teenage-hood by reading every melodramatic graphic novel and watching whatever sappy emotional-youth-centered television show I can find. The funny/dark thing about it is that it only has me confront my lack of social experience closer, as I now do it with fiction instead of people, similar to podcasts which are a one-way flow of information without my participation in the conversation.\n\n----\n\nI've gone to therapy for depression when I was about 10, then around 14, and just recently this past academic year at college at the age of 19. The game changer for this year was how the previous summer I started **noticing my own voice in my head habitually saying \"I want to die,\" \"Please just put a gun in my mouth,\"** and other overtly suicidal catchphrases repeatedly. It was like a tic; I don't have tourettes syndrome and personally have never met anyone who does but this felt like a thought-based internal version of what I imagine it would be like. **It's like a pop-up from a virus on your computer; you don't want it to be there and you immediately want it to go away, but it just keeps coming.**\n\nThis merely served to strengthen the therapist's usual argument that I've *solely* become neurochemically dependent on an inner critic that has run wild. That seems generally true (though I'm not clear on what they mean by dependent) but it's not news to me, and I don't think it paints the whole picture as it doesn't explain the dichotomy between these negative/intrusive thoughts and my primary consciousness.\n\n**During therapy, just like the last two times**, I was given positive mantras and exercises to increase positive self-talk. I would try them for about two weeks, start to believe that they were working, and then take a step back and realize my life hadn't changed one bit which let all my effort crumble. **I lose will-power, go back to the lazy cycle of comfortable self-hatred**, and lie my way out of therapy. I would tell them and my parents that I was feeling better just so I would stop feeling like I was wasting my time.\n\nPart of what makes therapy so difficult and feel so disingenuous to me (in comparison to just talking to real friends and family) is that **I continue to overanalyze and read into the relationship with my therapist just as I do with social interactions, which leads to more depressive thoughts** spinning any small details to negative statements about myself or how the therapist thinks about me. The two most common thoughts are that \"they can tell you're a bad person, they're just not letting on or telling you because it's their job to make you feel better\" or \"they wouldn't be helping you if they weren't getting paid.\" Another part is that I need context to learn. I need to know the pathway of beginning-to-end-goal and direction of motivations to gain any knowledge/insight from any activities or information. With this in mind, **I often feel like I'm wasting time** or not making progress **if I don't know what the therapist is** looking for or **trying to do** with certain lines of questioning. I'm afraid they have to withhold information about their findings or process as they think I may take it the wrong way or act irrationally due to my problems. I feel that, if I go into therapy again, I will have to be very upfront with these two things.\n\nIf there's one positive thing that I've come away from therapy with, it's the certainty that **my 'depression' is a result of a problem with me physically/chemically in regards to my mental health and *not* caused by a flaw in my character or personality.** I can feel a bit better about myself by detaching my view of myself from my depression, but of course this relief is only available during momentary lapses of the aforementioned depression.\n\nNow, if I continue that self-detached look at my \"depression\" (which, again, is more a strong mix of social anxiety & lack of self-esteem) I am given a new way out by **considering SSRIs like Zoloft or Prozac, or other related drugs. I would love to hear peoples' thoughts on them**. I still am not completely open about the current existence of my depression, and I'm afraid that if I tried to pursue obtaining these drugs legally that I would be turned down due to lack of exhibiting a previous serious history of risk. I am extremely curious about them, and have strongly considered going back to therapy a fourth time as a means of attaining them.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nAddition 1:\n\nI've started to find stability. After numerous circumstances, of both validation and observing others, I've started to gain a general comfort with myself and hope for my future, which caused the intrusive thoughts to stay intrusive and not bleed into my main train of thought for a good portion of time.\n\nHowever, three* major remaining factors lead me to continue to struggle with social anxiety/lack of self-esteem and an even stronger string of separated suicidal thoughts that are now starting to bleed into my consciousness again:\n\n1. My mood still tends to swing to being generally uppity/silly with little reason or warning (as mentioned earlier), which sometimes leads to annoying my peers which I then notice, mull over, and continually reprimand myself for when my mood swings back down. **These \"mood swings\" suck** (they may be misdiagnosed, I just don't know of a better name for them) **because no matter how much I anticipate and attempt to prepare against them, they always happen and I can't stop it. In different situations or around certain people, I just change, and my negative/depressive mind only punishes me for any even slightly embarrassing things I remember.** It just occurs internally and I feel like I can't standardize my personality no matter how hard I try. I really think this is one of the missing pieces of the puzzle that the therapists didn't catch which could clue into the foundations of my other related problems.\n\n2. I feel like I've always alienated people I respect. It's likely a result of this increasingly unpredictable mood and subtly erratic behavior. I still have these moments every once in a while where I feel that someone, who I considered a friend or at least an admired peer, starts avoiding or moving away from me in reaction to something I've done. Most of the time I later know what it is that pushed them away, sometimes it's an accident or acknowledged-negative-aspect of my character, and sometimes I have no idea. In these moments, I always want closure; if not an opportunity to right the wrong, I would want nothing more than to convince that person that I understand and agree with them, showing them that I also dislike my flaws/myself. Unfortunately, pursuing this closure would probably only push them away more (or, at least, that's the narrative my depressive mind has). I can only imagine that they wouldn't want to be around me, so I need to respect their space but that leaves me no opportunity to communicate to them how I feel. **It sometimes seems like I'm destined to push people away**. Feeling that just hurts immensely, despite the fact that it doesn't happen super often. This leads to a special flavor of suicidal thoughts that I will finally earn the respect of those who don't like my when I commit suicide, as I will be acting in accordance of their will to the ultimate extent. I end up thinking something like \"they will only care when I take my own life. Only then will they take me seriously and realize what I've endured. Only when I do it they'll know that I hate me too, that I see my own flaws, and maybe I'll earn their respect. Well, that's only those who will remember me, anyways.\" All of this specific self-talk is exacerbated as I've been having a gradual falling-out with a friend recently, which I'm afraid is due to spreading realization that I'm not as good a person as I think or say I am.\n\n3. As I am afraid of pushing people away/alienating them, **I am afraid of what people will think if I talk to them about these problems, but I need to talk.** I'm afraid they won't believe me (as mentioned earlier) and/or will think I'm just doing this for attention which will make them think lower of me and only put me further from getting help. As I've said earlier, I am very eager to receive input and constructive criticism but I rarely feel like I'm able to ask due to the possibility of inconveniencing or alienating others. My negative mind makes me think that I will further embarrass myself, overstep my boundaries, or **seem selfish by seeking help from others for all this as it's placing a lot of unsolicited responsibility on them.**\n\nFor the three reasons outlined above, my self-doubt has started emerge again. It's varies in its subtlety or extremity and is inconsistent, but it's there and I'm afraid my natural unhappiness will just be a part of my life forever. I know I will have to deal with it. I'm hoping that I will fully solidify myself as an adult later on and find happiness to overcome this problem,\n\nbut I need a failsafe in order to commit the effort to living on and trying to better myself. I need time to grow, but I want to make sure I won't be wasting my whole life if it doesn't work out.\n\nThat's why **I've recently been entertaining the idea that if I'm still not happy when I turn 30-years-old, I am going to** remove my marks from the world, tie up all loose ends, make sure all debts are paid, and **take my own life.** This idea of giving myself a guaranteed decade is both a way for my conscious mind to regain temporary stability while feeding into my suicidal contemplations as a means of keeping chances of self-harm at bay and tricking the self-destructive part of my brain that I'm actually cooperating and taking a step forward in its direction, though I consciously think I will probably have solved all this before then. Still, there's the chance that I won't have, and I will probably be much more eager to kill myself after failing that task.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nAddition 2:\n\ni'm definitely not full-on suicidal; i know that's its own whole state of being. i'm someone who naturally thinks about suicide frequently, but rarely with any depth. i hope i'm just melodramatic, anxious, overthinking, etc.\n\ni've confronted those parts of me plenty of times, and i still can't turn it off.\n\ni still truly doubt the appreciation i receive from others, even close friends and immediate family, and think they just find themselves in situations where it's overall personally beneficial to maintain different amounts of positivity with me, or feel obligated rather than internally compelled to be with me.\n\ni definitely notice my primary symptoms are exacerbated/mainly an issue when im around certain communities or social circles. they still exist when i'm not, but are arguably negligible. the shitty thing is i inevitably morph any new social environment in my head to a problematic one; i make bad impressions or take things too harshly, which then leads to real or imagined negative relationships which fuels my primary symptoms again.\n\nthis shit isn't logical, but the fact that i still feel it is the problem, which then makes me think i'm just inherently bad which lead to the problems in the first place.\n\ni haven't thought about my suicide-at-30 option for a while, and i still doubt i'll use it, but it definitely still stands within consideration.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nAddition 3:\n\nI'll losing motivation to do my work, and find internships or work for the future.\n\nThe worsening instability of my mood has lead to increased irritability.\n\nEver since my last (unsuccessful) use of therapy, I've tried to rely on the consoling input of others to cope, but I realized the hard way that not all people are cooperative/kind to those struggling with certain things and most people don't give good advice.\n\nThese two things, the irritability and talking to those who don't actually want to hear about my problems, were primary factors in my recent loss of social activity. I've had an unspoken yet palpable rough patch with peers who I considered my best friends after I've been crabby towards them in pressured situations. I'm pretty sure alienated them with stories of depression struggle that they weren't ready for. This catalyzed a previous drifting apart between our social groups, as they happened to be connected to people who understandably don't click with me. Their need for space from me seems completely reasonable when looking at my actions.\n\nThese people very obviously maintain a generally friendly demeanor when we're working together, but don't have energy to uphold social contact with me or fake social interest when they're not obligated to be near me. I work with them a lot, to the point where I'm afraid I've trapped them, forcing them to be around me.\n\nI have plenty of other friends, but now it's especially hard for me to internally take their appreciation seriously (due to my own conditions), and I don't see them nearly as often.\n\nI'm still having recurring fantasies about how killing myself will affect others, mainly those who I suspect don't like me. I think about how suicide would finally make everyone aware of what I struggle with, which is something I constant feel the need to express. I imagine those who don't respect me realizing I hate myself, showing how we've always agreed on me. I imagine them learning how people are never exactly as they seem, and possibly being more open-minded in the future.\n\nI happened to contemplate suicide long enough to decide on a method. If the time comes, I'll get a pistol and shoot myself in the head the instant I jump off a bridge or building. That should be guaranteed, combining two reliable methods.\n\nI have seen a handful of other people with arguably worse lives and worse personalities than me, both self-aware and not. Still, I am unable to make myself feel or truly believe that I am a person of merit to those around me. No matter how clearly I know the truth, I can't act on it because I can't feel it.\n\nI have finally made an appointment with my primary care physician to talk to them about getting pills, possibly with an actually good long-term long-distance therapist, just at the beginning of this summer. I really hope it works because I'm starting to feel like I may be much more at risk of killing myself some time in the future.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nI got out of school for the summer, which was giving me my anxiety. I've spent time with great friends who have given me self-worth. I've made friends through communities based around both my artistic tastes and moral outlook, which has strengthened my trust for social skills.\n\nI was on Zoloft for two weeks and never contacted the referred psychiatric office because I felt fine.\n\nI still have occasional intrusive thoughts, but they are way less severe and nothing I can't deal with.\n\nIf things come back again in the future, I know who to call and what to do.\n\nI may be free.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6nqwl0/ive_had_intrusive_suicidal_thoughts_for_one_year/", "title": "I've had intrusive suicidal thoughts for one year after a lifelong battle with depression.
