She can't deal with me until my 18th this december, but I understand. Who wants someone who's scared of everything, who can't clean a fucking kitchen table, who has anger issues, who is on 5 different meds, who's scared to even talk to you. I'm not jealous of her relationship with your bio son like she thinks, I just can't understand how a mom doesn't hate her kid. I cant understand a mom who doesn't guilt trip him, who doesn't manipulate him into giving her compliments. It doesn't hurt to see her and him together happy, it's just confusing. I don't hate him, I think he's a cool kid. I just avoid him so he doesn't have to be exposed to someone as fucked up as I am. It hurts to know I'm so difficult that you cant be bothered with me for two months but I get it. I've never been wanted, but it still hurts.\n\nThis is why I tried to die, no one wants me and those who put up with me because they feel like they need to shouldn't have to be around someone like me. I could OD on my pills tonight, but I don't want her to have to deal with my body or traumatize her or her son. I'll probably figure out how at my next placement, probably somewhere behind the school so I dont traumatize anyone there either.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7pb9f/im_unwanted/", "title": "I'm unwanted", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PhoenixFireCat", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634174534, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7pb9f/im_unwanted/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426860.3284347, "replies_charged": false}
