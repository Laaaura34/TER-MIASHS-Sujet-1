Just now, typing this out, I've come to the realization that that is over 1/4th of my life it has sucked the joy away from. 1/4 of my life...\n\nMy dad died when I was in high-school. I never dealt with the thousands of issues that arose as a result of that. There was a...terrible accident and he was dead. In the blink of an eye. In a way I hate him for it. But I love him. And I miss him. There were things he could have done to prevent it, but he was over-confident and now I don't have a father. My family never really healed. It was not supposed to be this way. It was not supposed to fucking be this way.\n\nRecently this has gotten worse, or maybe it is only a temporary low. I'm not sure of anything. I live with my girlfriend but rarely see her. Our work schedules conflict. I'm on nights, which seems to be fuel to the fire of my depression. I'm not sure what's changed, but it's been all I can do not to have a full blown mental breakdown at work. \n\nMy thoughts have run dark. They say: You could kill yourself. You are worthless. They all hate you anyway. Why not? What's the point anyway? Look at how far you still need to go! All you do is toil away in obscurity not even worthy of mention. They will not remember you. They will not miss you. You are worthless and pathetic. Everything is worthless. They will be happier that you are dead.\n\nI'm sick of fighting this. I'm not done yet but I am tired. 6 FUCKING YEARS.
