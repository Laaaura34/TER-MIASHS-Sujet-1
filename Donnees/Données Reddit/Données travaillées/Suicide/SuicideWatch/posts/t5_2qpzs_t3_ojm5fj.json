Precisely the plan was to electrocute myself as it doesn't really require a lot of prep. I won't go into details about the specific act due to the fear someone might attempt to recreate it. \n\n  \nAnyways, that would have been my second suicide attempt, the first one being about a year and a half ago with me stabbing myself in the neck a few times. Not the most elegant suicide method I admit but I wasn't looking for something elegant at the time. I was diagnosed with dysthymia (Persistent Depressive Disorder) about 3 years ago, changed a few therapists and medications but nothing helped enough.   \n\n\nIt just feels like life has just been postponing suicide since my first attempt. On the bright side, I have not self-harmed since then but hell do I want to sometimes. In every bridge, every speeding car, every kitchen knife, every rope, every policeman even all I see is a way to death.  \n\n\nThe main question that people might have from the title - Did I go through with it? No. Why? I don't know really, instead, I went for a run (which is usually a temporary mood boost for me but it goes away quite quickly) and then I was too tired to do it. Do I still want to do it? Yes, yes and yes. I only stopped myself today too because a friend of mine has her birthday today and I don't want to ruin it even if we are not really close. It's just all postponing but I'm not sure until when.  \n\n\nAnyways, thanks for your time, hope you are doing better!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ojm5fj/i_had_a_suicide_attempt_planned_for_last_night/", "title": "I had a suicide attempt planned for last night.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "justathrowa2122", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626202208, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ojm5fj/i_had_a_suicide_attempt_planned_for_last_night/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428574.413844, "replies_charged": false}
