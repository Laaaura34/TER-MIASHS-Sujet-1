I can't live with myself knowing I broke a promise to him. I miss him so much. I wish I could go back in time and stop myself. How could I? I can never replace him, I don't want to. He's incredibly special to me (voice in my head: I guess not special enough because you still fucked him over.) I'm so stupid and thoughtless. I ruin everything. I just want him to call me and talk to me. I would give anything just to hear his voice one more time... I am broken. I am so empty without my best buddy. My dear friend, my pal for life, I'm so sorry that I went back on my word. It has been a very confusing time. You have every right to be angry and not trust me. I don't know how to even explain why I did what I did. I never meant to hurt you. I feel so disgusting. Will you ever come back? Will you ever? I miss you terribly. I missed your birthday because of this and it makes me very sad that I couldn't celebrate with you. I love you man.
