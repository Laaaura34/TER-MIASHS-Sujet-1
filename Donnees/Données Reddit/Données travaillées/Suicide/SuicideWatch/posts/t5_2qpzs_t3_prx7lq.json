My coworker flirted with me, we got together. Here\u2019s where it splits. She told me she was fucking me and two other guys, we weren\u2019t exclusive so nbd. Then she told me she\u2019s pregnant and I\u2019m the most likely father. This was last July. January roles around she finally decided to abort and then I got into a car crash and she broke up with me over text (even told me how proud she was she \u201cgrew\u201d enough to not *have* to do things in person.\n\nI stuck with her through all that and she dumped me like a sack of shit.\n\nThen after months she starts trying to hang out with me and makes me sell her booze when I\u2019m at work even though I was a recovering alcoholic. \n\nI got caught drunk at work cause she pushed my buttons one two many times and I snapped. Lost my job, my living situation is that I\u2019m on a couch and about to be homeless and now I make 60% as much as before working at a gods dammed circle k and I hate it. She\u2019s moved on just fine and still works her cushy job. I\u2019m out of options, at least any good ones and I know what I need to do to show her what kind of person she is and what she\u2019s done to me but occasionally I feel happy and don\u2019t think about her and it makes me rethink my \u201cfinal solution\u201d. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not miserable every second of the day but the amount of time I agave to work and the poverty I\u2019m facing now is unbearable long term and I don\u2019t think I can get out. Do you think I should just bite the bullet and be done or should I let another person get away with taking my whole life away from me again?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/prx7lq/my_life_has_gone_to_shit_due_to_falling_in_love/", "title": "My life has gone to shit due to falling in love.
