I workout like 6 days a week to try and help with my mood but nothing is working. I don\u2019t want to ask my therapist for help cause I feel like a major burden so I\u2019m hoping by my birthday I don\u2019t off myself or something. I don\u2019t want to tell any body about this because I\u2019ll be forcefully be put in the hospital and I really don\u2019t want that. I\u2019m 21 and I\u2019m feeling like my life is over and I\u2019m trying to hold on until my birthday so I don\u2019t kill myself. It stinks that I can\u2019t control my thoughts so I\u2019m just venting here. \n\nI would be living a lot behind if I ever killed myself. I\u2019ve done pretty well in school, having social relationships, and getting far in my fitness journey. However I think I haven\u2019t done enough in my life and I feel like if I were to die today or tomorrow this would be okay because everything that I\u2019ve done up until now is okay. \n\nAppreciate anyone who comments on some advice thanks all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pn1e74/honestly_im_such_a_pathetic_waste_of_space/", "title": "Honestly I\u2019m such a pathetic waste of space.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Throwaway818389292", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 30, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631481577, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pn1e74/honestly_im_such_a_pathetic_waste_of_space/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635427641.2978752, "replies_charged": false}
