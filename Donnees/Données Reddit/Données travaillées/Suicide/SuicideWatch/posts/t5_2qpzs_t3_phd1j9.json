I want to get a dog so at least someone besides my immediate family can love me but I feel I am still not understood. I am alone.\n\nAdd in the crushing societal collapse and the extended pain and fact that I was not fired for lack of work or production (I have been grinding out 50+ hour weeks at a hard job and working to learn and improve myself and have tried over the years to continue in this but whatever I have done hasn\u2019t been enough.\n\nEveryone tells me I am smart and work hard but I have been fired from almost every job I have worked and have no way for my parents to take care of me full time when I need to take care of them in a few years and even then my sister should be able to.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine life after 30 and it\u2019s just so much of a pain. Taking on a life that clearly doesn\u2019t want me and nothing I do being good enough to just put food on my table and knowing the suffering will only get worse. Whether culture or climate change or struggling to spend another year without a job and the debt I face and knowing that no one will hire me ever again I see no point in living. I don\u2019t want to hurt others and revenge or anger is out of the questions.\n\nSuicide would be easier and cleaner than struggling like this for no point. Family is the only reason I am alive now as I am just so tired of it all", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/phd1j9/reasons_to_not_kms/", "title": "Reasons to not kms", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "yolotheunwisewolf", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630700412, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/phd1j9/reasons_to_not_kms/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422309.308346, "replies_charged": false}
