Forever? \n\nThis life shit is hard and i live every day in misery. My dad committed suicide, my older brother attempted suicide. I\u2019m extremely suicidal and am a danger to myself each day. \n\nSomething that i\u2019ve really noticed was how hard it is for me to make eye contact with people now. I can\u2019t, like at all. I have no confidence, I don\u2019t even know who i am. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s my mom or some random stranger. it\u2019s so hard for me to make eye contact and talk to anybody. Will i ever be normal?? What does that even feel like?\n\ni don\u2019t know this is all mumble jumbled bullshit but i really wish i could have a hug right now", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qd7xcq/is_it_possible/", "title": "Is it possible???", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Western_Dependent388", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634871878, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qd7xcq/is_it_possible/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425538.409308, "replies_charged": false}
