Im on and off heavy drinking. Dont take any drugs or medication aside from sleeping pills, if I dont take them I could go few days without sleep. At some point I removed myself from all social media platforms and kind of pushed everyone close to me away. I tried to help myself but ended up in a darker place. I'd appreciate any tips to help me trick my brain into relaxing or falling asleep naturaly, it may solve part of the problem. I apologies in advance if this post sound insignificant or not worthy for this subreddit.
