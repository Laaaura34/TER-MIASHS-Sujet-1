I try to have joy when I can but as soon as I stop doing whatever, or it doesn't go well enough or I cannot stop thinking about negative stuff, my day gets ruined. Again and again.. \n\nI thought I was over it... I kinda was.. Last year life was great honestly.. But it was all escapism.. All I did was nutrition study, language study, food making, exercise and sleep.. \n\nBut then of course, I got so many constant comments about my appearance how I was ugly, that I looked like a guy and pointed and laughed at I just stopped going outside, stop making varied delicious foods, though still did the others for a bit.. But even that is gone this year.. Whenever I try to become stronger, better version of myself, more resilient, kind, fun.... I get met with so much constant push back it is getting exhausting.. and nobody understands.. I don't share much with my friends these days because it's just the same and so exhausting, especially to be remembered myself about all of the negatives, when I just am trying to be in the now and do what little I can to improve on myself..\n\nAt this point however, I am getting worried I guess.. I already attempted before.. One serious attempt, and multiple smaller one which at most just gave me some temporary pain but had 1% chance of killing me really.... Why I am worried is that I actually feel it.. The temptation, thoughts, feelings about suicide becoming as strong as back when I had my serious attempt, and I don't know how long I can go on without trying again..   \n\n\nSadly there is no help for me.. I need money to fix myself... At least some minor surgeries to fix my flaws so I can look average at least and not harassed fearing leaving the door every time, move out to a safe place instead of where I currently am which is also unsafe, have money for more than basic needs unless I save up for 6+ months at a time to splurge a bit on more fun stuff like clothes I need or maybe a new game and such.. Just living on food, meds, basic life necessities gets exhausting.\n\nI thankfully started seeing a psychologist last week so at least I got that finally after asking for years, but it's like once a month kind of thing atm because it is a free offer and I cannot afford to pay for one myself.. \n\n  \nI also am seeing if I am stronger than before to see if I can hold a job or study again, since last I tried it went extremely bad and I broke down completely.. And that's with streaming.. It has a pressure like a job (for me), but it has been difficult.. though while it is extremely difficult to me, it has also brought the most joy to me in a long while... I feel so conflicted. Especially since I am also here, feeling the pressure and just not being able to handle it as much anymore.. \n\nIt was the last thing I felt I could try. See if I could actually accomplish anything, yet... I feel my friends and some followers just pitied me or were curious for a bit, and now what.. I am too broken to become anything ever.. So why bother going on.. Especially since my entire life except for last year (only year in my life where I actually felt happy) has been overall terrible, hard, sad and filled with escapism.. \n\nIf I didn't have streamer subs and a friend coming over soon I dunno, I feel I might've been gone already by now, or tried to be.. Sigh...  \n\n\nThank you for reading..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ogkl6n/feeling_like_an_ugly_failure_and_that_i_am_no/", "title": "Feeling like an ugly failure and that I am no good at life..", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Korean__Princess", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625791868, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ogkl6n/feeling_like_an_ugly_failure_and_that_i_am_no/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426987.2286088, "replies_charged": false}
