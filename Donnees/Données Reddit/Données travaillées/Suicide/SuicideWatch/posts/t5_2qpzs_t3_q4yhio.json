I finally have an assistant manager job with an income I could support myself on, but I I have no savings. But I fight with my mom all the time, tonight she\u2019s given me one week  until she kicks me out, stops paying for my car insurance, my therapy, as well as my cell phone bill. \n\nI have no savings, so I would be homeless. She owns the car I drive so I don\u2019t know if she\u2019d let me keep it to live in. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while, so it just seems like it\u2019s the right time now. I\u2019m just tired of crying all the time. \n\nI\u2019m debating weather I will pretend like nothing is wrong all week before I do it; or if I fully commit, quit my job, break up with my girlfriend and just use the small amount of money I have to try any drug I can get my hand on and drink until I get alcohol poisoning.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q4yhio/im_going_to_kill_myself_in_one_week/", "title": "I\u2019m going to kill myself in one week.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "thecodeineiscoming", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633829542, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q4yhio/im_going_to_kill_myself_in_one_week/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425320.0933378, "replies_charged": false}
