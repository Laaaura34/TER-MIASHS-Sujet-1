Things that are \"fun\" are just meaningless, what's the point of going to a nice dinner, why should I cherish my family, so what if I travel the world? Taste only lasts a moment, my family's chosen to stay set in their ways and I've already seen the world on the internet. It's ugly. It's full of people that are too stupid to fix these mistakes and actively resist changing. The degree I'm not even able to complete would only be preparing me for a bad job I mildly dislike that would just ensure I don't live in poverty. I could be happier in art, but artists are never happy given they are more likely to starve to death than to live an acceptable life. \n\nWhat does it matter if I choose to end my life, everyone dies someday. At least I won't have to wander around the world like some insomnia afflicted ghost. I despise children and I know I won't be having them because I'm 90% sure I'm going to physically abuse them out of anger when they make a mistake. I also hate dogs and cats (ESPECIALLY baby versions of them, I seem to have a chronic loathing for anything cute). I tried to read those \"why should I stay alive posts\" on various websites and all it mentions are family, dinner, children, dogs, cats: all things that make me more angry. I'm filled with hate towards this world and I want to leave this world. This world has nothing to offer to me, nor do I have anything to offer to it. \n\n\"Is there anything you want that you can't get?\" Well, in terms of materialistic things, I guess I want the new stuffed pokemon. I bought it a week ago. What now? I'm unhappy again. What would make me happy long term is when every person can afford a mansion. There's no war, and everyone receives higher education. And the world meets the guidelines in the Paris agreement. Obviously this is impossible: I literally have to choose between food or rent! I've been to therapy, but therapy doesn't change the world around me. In fact therapy doesn't do anything for me, and I've been in for months. \n\nI wonder how I used to be so optimistic, but I no longer remember what made me so passionate about living. Why should I live if there is no joy in being a part of this world? If the living have desires, then without one am I not no different from someone who's already passed on? I couldn't care less for those who may miss me. They are part of this ugly world, after all. \n\nI would find a reason to keep my life, but it seems there already is no life that's available for me to live.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/px21y1/how_do_i_live_life_without_a_life_to_live/", "title": "How do I live life without a life to live?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "icantdecidewhoiam", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632818642, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/px21y1/how_do_i_live_life_without_a_life_to_live/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426558.4705741, "replies_charged": false}
