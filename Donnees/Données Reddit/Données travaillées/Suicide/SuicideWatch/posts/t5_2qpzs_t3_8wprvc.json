I wanted to meetup some foreign friends, but for everytime that i spend laughing there was two times that i cried.\nIt still was one or my best experience so far.\nI feel like cutting myself and strangulate. \nOn the last day of the festival i think im simply going to jump off a nice 50+meters cliff. Im not afraid of dying, im afraid of living.\nI do not believe ill ever be happy in the end.but emptiness feels more appealing than living a life that doesnt teach you anything.\nFamily, friends, Can help you out but i am more of a rusty bail chained to their feets than a chair they can rely on.\nIll make them sad but nothing compared to the bad things \u00e0 toxic person like me will make them endure if i keep on trying to fight.\n\nThank you for reading, ill read some answers if any, but m'y decision is taken. Might update one day but this is not what i wish for.
