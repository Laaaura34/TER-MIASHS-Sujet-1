It\u2019s finally reached a positive feedback loop that I can\u2019t control. I get dizzy, I get confused, I can\u2019t complete a simple task, I get more frustrated, I get more confused, I get more dizzy. I want to end it all right now, but I can\u2019t when everyone for the first time in my entire life is being so supportive. It\u2019s crazy to think this is what it took. I feel my fianc\u00e9 becoming more distant, the stress must be unimaginable. I just have so much I wanted to do before I left this world but I\u2019m losing my ability to do much of anything anymore. I want to stay strong and I know people live fine with brain tumors for a long time but I can tell this is going to be a long difficult road I don\u2019t think I want to travel.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pd6a4p/its_going_to_happen_soon_i_cant_sleep_since_ive/", "title": "It\u2019s going to happen soon, I can\u2019t sleep since I\u2019ve gotten the news.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "blasphamy420", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630140316, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pd6a4p/its_going_to_happen_soon_i_cant_sleep_since_ive/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426576.3903677, "replies_charged": false}
