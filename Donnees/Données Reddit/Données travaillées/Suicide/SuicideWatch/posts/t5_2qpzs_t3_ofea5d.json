I read through the rules and sidebar and want to make sure I\u2019m following everything. \n\nSo here it is: I have a desire to die that has been growing in the last few months. Thinking \u201cI want to die\u201d is like a mantra I ruminate on through out my day. \n\nI don\u2019t have previous attempts, just previous depression and family history of depression. I have ideas of how I would do it, but I\u2019m not happy with them. I would want find a way my wife and young kids would get insurance money (seems tricky), and I would want to be found by first responders so that no one I love is traumatized.\n\nI\u2019ve admitted to myself that thoughts are serious enough that I should try to get help. I know intellectually that my wife and kids require my continuing existence for their well-being, despite my feelings I\u2019m just a paycheck and a living household appliance. I know there are lots of other reasons to live, even if none of them feel compelling right now. \n\nI mentioned my suicidal thoughts to my brother and he encouraged me to take advantage of psychologist services through my work benefits. I tried booking an appointment but their openings were only for weekends. I chickened and canceled as I don\u2019t want my wife finding out and worrying. I need to try again somewhere where I can get in during the work week. \n\nI should also try talking to a doctor about antidepressants again. I took them for several months during a bad stretch 15 years ago. \n\nI was really interested to learn from the subreddit wiki that seasonal suicide rates are highest in the early summer. This makes me feel better, knowing I am experiencing this with other people. \n\nI will hope to make some more posts on here or figure out the \u201cCheck-In\u201d posts or something. My feelings of being a burden extend to therapists and Internet strangers, but I will try.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ofea5d/first_post_admitting_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "First post admitting suicidal thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cenazoic_soul", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625643872, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ofea5d/first_post_admitting_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428024.9736154, "replies_charged": false}
