I fixated on the idea of running away and committing suicide for the longest that my mindset is just this. recently my parents moved and i just graduated and i\u2019m having a very hard time adjusting for 2-3 month straight i\u2019ve been just crying myself to sleep. and i\u2019ve lost a couple of weight which is bad because i\u2019m very skinny, my bmi is around 14-15. I started doing stuff again like bad habits*, self harm. i feel disgusting and i really want help. my mind feels messy and all i do is cry. i have notes on how to change on, how to get better, and i\u2019ve watched multiple videos and guides but it isn\u2019t getting any better. i\u2019m trying my best i\u2019m doing art to make money so i can pay for college and i\u2019m trying to get a job so i\u2019m not useless. i messed up my grades and i\u2019m going to a community college also i have no social life and i know these stuff don\u2019t define me but they still bother me so i\u2019m trying to change but it\u2019s very hard and everything is messy i created a reddit a while back and never really used it anyways i thought you guys could help because it\u2019s gotten really bad for me. i have a good boyfriend, friends and family who cares but i know it\u2019s gotten way too much for them as well so i don\u2019t wanna bother them with these thoughts. i asked my sister to set up an appointment with a therapist for me but i\u2019m worried that it\u2019s expensive.
