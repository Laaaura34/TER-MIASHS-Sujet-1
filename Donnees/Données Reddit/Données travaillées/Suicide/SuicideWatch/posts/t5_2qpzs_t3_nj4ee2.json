And also because I am **ashamed**.\n\n**Shame** ... It's the emotion of my life, because of this fucking harassment.\n\n* The shame of always being disturbed when I'm in my 30's and it's been 15 years since I have been bullied.\n* The shame of not succeeding in moving on when I do not have the impression that I have lived through horrible things. I was not raped. I have not lived in horrible conditions in a third world country. I was not physically abused. I was just being verbally assaulted every day for 5 years. And yet words can literally kill you slowly. Harassment is a poison that is injected into you in small doses every day. At some point, the bully doesn't even need to act, you secrete this poison yourself. I'm able to have that reasoning, believe it, and tell it to another bullying victim, but when it comes to me, I don't admit it. I always feel like it was ... nothing. And that I make a big deal out of it.\n* The shame of not having known how to defend myself against their words. I had no repartee.\n* Shame when I read that what does not kill makes you stronger. You know what ? I don't feel strong at all. The period of harassment didn't do me any good. Externally, yes, you would think I am doing quite well. I am not ugly. I have 1-2 friends. I earn a good living. But inside... no. It's like I have an indelible sadness. I don't know when it happened exactly, it slowly took hold in adolescence ... I can't get rid of it. It is more or less present. I can manage it better than 10 years ago, fortunately. I can spend days feeling pretty good, optimistic, motivated, and the sadness is just a subtle melancholy. But this sadness is never far away, and when it arrives, I feel like I'm still 14 years old, after a horrible day at school... Like, back to the past without any Dolorean.\n\nIn short, there you have it, shame, sadness, social anxiety with a bit of paranoia (I often have this thought \"Me\" versus \"Them\") ...\n\nI have already consulted therapists but nothing effective ...\n\nBut the good thing is that I don't want to kill myself. I've had the urge, believe me, and I'm doing this thread for you too, not only to get this shit off my chest. There are so many people who commit suicide because of bullying at school, it's insane. It's \"OK\" to have suicidal thoughts, don't dismiss them (but please don't take action without thinking very, very, very long.....)\n\nAs for me, thanks God, I am still able to have positive emotions and to feel joy. I just have to accept the dark side I guess.\n\nThanks for reading me.
