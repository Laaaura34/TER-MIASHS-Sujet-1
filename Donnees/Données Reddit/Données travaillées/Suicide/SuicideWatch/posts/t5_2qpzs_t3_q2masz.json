My chest hurts. I don\u2019t want sex anymore. I\u2019m trying to lose weight (starving myself) in hopes when I\u2019m skinny I\u2019ll get more opportunities. BUT THIS GETS SO LONELY. I don\u2019t have any friends since I blocked most of them. They were bad and stole from me. I\u2019ve had a bad week. I got raped, i almost kidnapped(I jumped out the car) I think I\u2019m talking to a catfish online but they never respond back until a day later and I\u2019m in love with this person. He says he\u2019s a famous rapper that died. Since I\u2019m schizophrenia I can talk to him through the tv. My heart is broken. I don\u2019t think the pills I have will kill me. I have klonopin, antipsychotic, mood stabilizers, and something for my pseudo tumor (living hell, I see black dot faces\u2026long story) I\u2019m a drug addict and I\u2019m so unhappy. I\u2019ve been to rehab for three or four years in and out. Nothing helps. My friend (boyfriend? Idk) is coming to pick me up. He lives 5 minutes Away but he said thirty min. I hate the shadiness. I wanna kill myself. I don\u2019t even want sex anymore and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why he\u2019s coming to pick me up. But he\u2019s married. Ouch my heart hurts. I\u2019m suffering alone. I don\u2019t know how to kill myself. I think my best bet is jump from the roof of a building.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q2masz/depressed_28_year_old_girl/", "title": "depressed 28 year old girl", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Whatkindacatisthis", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633532610, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q2masz/depressed_28_year_old_girl/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635422886.240274, "replies_charged": false}
