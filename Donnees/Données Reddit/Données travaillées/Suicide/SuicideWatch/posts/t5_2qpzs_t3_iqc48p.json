I\u2019ve become a lot less shy and developed good social skills, been working out and basically gotten to a place where my past self would admire who I am today but in the back of my head that sense of tiredness seems to grown. I feel less sure about my future and sometimes can\u2019t even imagine having one. I think I\u2019m happy and enjoy where I\u2019ve gotten but I\u2019ve lost that sense of being able to see a future for myself. I keep jumping between feeling like I just want to die to feeling so proud of myself when I look in the mirror. I don\u2019t even feel sad about it just tired and waiting to be able to sleep and rest peacefully. I think about suicide a lot more often now but don\u2019t feel scared or anything and that feels worrisome, like there is something wrong with me. I\u2019ve tried talking to some friends about it and they sometimes tel me to think about the people around me but I\u2019m my head I\u2019m thinking why would I care if once I pass away it\u2019s no longer my problem,  my reality just stop exciting, my problems go away and I just become part of the energy and matter that makes up the world. Don\u2019t expect any help but I guess it\u2019s just nice to feel heard and know that you aren\u2019t alone. If my time is short it\u2019s better to make that short time feel better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/iqc48p/unsure_whats_going_on/", "title": "Unsure what\u2019s going on", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Luis_gg21", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1599771315, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/iqc48p/unsure_whats_going_on/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428144.999939, "replies_charged": false}
