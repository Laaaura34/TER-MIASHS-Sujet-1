I have a long history of depression and suicide attempts. The last one was three years ago. I'm now in a 50/50 change in which I may or may not make it through the night. I called a suicide prevention line, but all they had to say is to occupy my self by either work or taking a walk. I'm not a newbie I know what to do but it didn't help. It's my last resort here, please help me. The easy way is to kill my self, pills are at hand and the knife is sharp.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pvacb6/i_need_help/", "title": "I need help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Lazy_Popcorn", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632587744, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pvacb6/i_need_help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427883.3103423, "replies_charged": false}
