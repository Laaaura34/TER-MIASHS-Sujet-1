I'm a few months away from homelessness, too mentally ill to hold a job that can support me, but I don't qualify for disability. I left my abusive family behind when I came out as queer and trans, and many of my friends have grown distant or straight up left me. My love life is not a thing, which just drives home the point that I am an unlovable, ugly mess who wants to be held and told she's worth it to someone that close to her.\n\nI don't see a way out, and all I can hear from people is how the half a dozen or so people around me might be upset, with no regard for the fact I am in constant mental and physical anguish. It physically hurts to exist when your emotions never turn off, and the baseline is debilitating melancholy. I want to die because it's the only way the pain would stop with the exception of an ungodly miracle.\n\nI just want it to end. Even if it is literally the end of my life, and all that remains after is nonexistence. At least there'd be no more pain, and then everyone I know can come to terms and move on", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e1suhu/life_is_just_constantly_painful/", "title": "Life is just constantly painful", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwitout97", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1574743181, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e1suhu/life_is_just_constantly_painful/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427564.478206, "replies_charged": false}
