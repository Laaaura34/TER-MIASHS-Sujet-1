I\u2019ve spoken to this one woman before, she\u2019s super judgmental. She doesn\u2019t think the things going on in my life are that upsetting. She slightly talks down to me and feels condescending. She uses a really fake voice while telling me she\u2019s going to hang up basically. \n  I know the difference, there are some decent people on crisis lines that are sincere. \n  Do people understand that just because they wouldn\u2019t get upset about your problems they are supposed to be caring about the person they are talking to. I feel like I failed a test and she decided I\u2019m not worthy of being in a crisis. \n  I\u2019ve spoken to her before. I didn\u2019t realize it was her. She totally invalidated me before. I stopped calling the crisis line for quite awhile because of her and how much worse I felt afterwards.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kxgp3s/when_im_told_well_im_going_to_let_you_go_now_on/", "title": "When I\u2019m told \u201cWell I\u2019m going to let you go now\u201d on the Suicide crisis line", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lostunivorn", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610664002, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kxgp3s/when_im_told_well_im_going_to_let_you_go_now_on/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426125.9733264, "replies_charged": false}
