All I do is work at a job I can not stand and go to a school where every living soul hates me. Every girl I\u2019ve ever even known has left me. Everyone for years and years and years, all they say, CONSTANTLY \u201cit\u2019s gonna get better\u201d shut the fuck up.\n\nYou\u2019ve been there saying that all along and when, one time, anything, when the fuck has it ever been better? Words are words and they mean nothing to me anymore.\n\nWhy won\u2019t something go right, why won\u2019t somebody love me. I take such strives to try and better myself constantly but I am rejected everywhere I go.\nNobody wants to hug me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbimhs/why_wont_it_get_better/", "title": "Why won\u2019t it get better", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ghostknotinwhite", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634670934, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbimhs/why_wont_it_get_better/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425193.0082114, "replies_charged": false}
