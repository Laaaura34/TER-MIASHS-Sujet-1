First time I asked for a rope was at 11 and I still remember it clearly, and while my high school years were what I used to consider the worst possible time for me to be alive, the past 3 years have been way, way worse, so much I don't consider it having a bottom, as it can always go deeper.\n\nI basically left a mental-crushing 6 years of secondary school to then go to C\u00e9gep (don't know the equivalent, iirc it's unique here and before Uni), and in C\u00e9gep, even though my brain came a bit together and I made actual friends and a strong and likeable personality, I slowly went back to not being able to focus in classes, to barely getting out of the bed anymore, to dropping out. 3 times, plus a fourth one during a career school. It's as if my brain just couldn't register anything anymore, and a constant and heavy headache followed me everywhere.\n\nNow, for the last 3 years, I haven't left my house or made any long-lasting progresses, even though the couple times I left (family gatherings and such), I morphed from a reclusive dude 5 years ago to the actual heart of the party, good with kids and a very smooth but honest and sometimes rash talker (manipulative also, it fused with my personality and is one of the things I'd qualify making me a 'bad person'). \nBut for actual advancements, I just can't keep up with it. I feel (or used to feel) motivated and hopeful, before the grim reality of this world sets back, and depression takes over again, and despite 2 or 3 days going well, I then go back to barely even being able to leave the bed or feed myself. Not matter how long or hard I try, one day is all I need to fuck it up. \nEven going as far as to remove every electronics from my house didn't either, as I just go further into escapism. I genuinely feel like my brain is thoroughly fucked at this point, it having been stunted by years of the same thoughts patterns and having developed an incredibly addictive personality.\n\nOther relevant infos:\n(Had psychiatric following since I was a kid, stopped cuz 18+, so now I'm without one);\n+ (tried at multiple organisms, but none ended up working and I'm not in a state where I can forward the energy);\n+ (pretty sure I'm at the lethargic phase of depression, since waking up itself makes me feel as if I haven't slept at all, and I could sleep up to 18 hours a day);\n+ (actual dementia symptoms that may develop further later on, but that are right now foretelling of a bad future);\n+ (not an actual brag cuz dudes who use that unironically are losers, but I was considered way above average when younger (never got the number tho), and from what I read, most dudes with higher IQ end up as either under-achievers or depressed. Also a factor in life having no meaning for me, since I can't fool myself into giving it one);\n+ (Canada, need a licence for firearms that I won't try to get).\n\nMy question is:\n\nHow do you leave the depths? How do you even find meaning in the world, when you have convinced yourself that nothing in this world has any purpose? Is there anyone that can even get out of such a huge hole or succeeded in doing so? I've been interested in trying out psilocybin, but it's illegal right now to even test it in laboratories where I live, even though I feel like it'd be a life-changer in a therapy, or rather my only reasonable, enduring and fast choice. \nMy brain is stuck, and the same thinking patterns of almost a decade of deep depression gotta have stunted something in there, along with the pills I was given, that only worsened my brain and made me feeling-less for the bigger part of Secondary School.\n\nI've been actually checking on cliffs close to my city to jump from and end it, or any other ways that isn't a slow-burn like pills but has a high success rate, especially since my time in this house is limited, but I may as well throw a line here and see what I can get.\n\n(Not sure if it posted, my mobile datas aren't so great right now)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/puzeu7/how_the_hell_do_you_even_come_back_from_the/", "title": "How the hell do you even come back from the depths of depression when you never felt the 'real world'", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "alt4chill", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632543272, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/puzeu7/how_the_hell_do_you_even_come_back_from_the/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422901.2893426, "replies_charged": false}
