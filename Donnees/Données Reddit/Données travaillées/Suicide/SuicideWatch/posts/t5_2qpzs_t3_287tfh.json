I have a great job but I think after a few decades programming I'm burnt out. I'm way behind on all my projects, staring at things that made sense to me years ago but are gibberish to me now. I'm not sure what my next move will be, both short term to save my ass, and long term to keep supporting my family. I think that's why I'm a little extra depressed today, the family. I should be out celebrating with my family, relaxing, whatever... but I've been here staring blankly at a laptop for hours. If there was any day this loving, providing father could use help, its today. Of course I keep thinking about all the other father's out there, struggling, many who have it so much worse than me,and I have no right to feel sorry for myself... which makes me feel even worse. \n\nAt any rate, I'm not in suicide crisis. I had the morbid thought pass through, followed by \"how shitty would it be to leave my living family unexpectedly, especially on a day like today.\" I used to have thoughts like that years ago when I was going through a messy divorce, and never acted on it. I have hundreds of more reasons not to do it now. Still, the thought scared me.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/287tfh/this_probably_should_go_in_offmychest_but_maybe/", "title": "This probably should go in offmychest, but maybe here... first suicidal thoughts in years", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throw_a_cide", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1402856432, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/287tfh/this_probably_should_go_in_offmychest_but_maybe/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426154.3656614, "replies_charged": false}
