I\u2019ve been going through a lot and I thought sending them my a suicide note would show me whether if they care or at least they would actually pay attention to me.\n\nI\u2019m not much, all of my friends are busy and don\u2019t really talk. My best friends decided to take a break from me and it\u2019s been ridiculously hard. I am actually considering doing the real thing cause at this point life is a joke. \n\nThe only thing is that is stopping me is the idea of what I\u2019m doing being messed up. So guys if you could be honest with me? Is what I\u2019m doing messed up?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lm9r3y/committing_suicide_to_see_if_theyll_care/", "title": "Committing suicide to see if they\u2019ll care", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Strong_Arm3044", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613610066, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lm9r3y/committing_suicide_to_see_if_theyll_care/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428388.1395676, "replies_charged": false}
