(We'd tried to restore our friendship after we had a big fight which was caused by her and told us if something bothers us we will tell next time immediately) So I asked her over the phone and she told me nothing was wrong and then she did not answer my next messages anymore, neither did she invite me to her birthday and we did not talk since.\nI figured she was busy with her life and she had treated me careless a couple of times in the past that I wasn't important to her anymore and she did not bother to tell me but let me figure out alone.
