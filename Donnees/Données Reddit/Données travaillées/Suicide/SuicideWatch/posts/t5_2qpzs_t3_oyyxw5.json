Because I can\u2019t talk to anyone irl about any of this because it\u2019s all too hard and painful and complex.\n\nI grew up in a loving, supportive, safe household. Even though my mom doesn\u2019t truly believe in or accept the reality of mental illness (she didn\u2019t believe me when I said I had anxiety in high school/early college), nevertheless I have wonderful parents. I\u2019m newly married to a pretty amazing, loving man. I have a home, a steady job, a good income. And I think that\u2019s what makes all of this so much more difficult and confusing. Because in spite of all this, deep inside of me, ever since I was young, I have never felt like I was meant for this world. I\u2019ve always felt like an outsider, even with family, even with my husband. I\u2019ve always just felt detached from everything. Never truly content or at peace. Always restless and thoughtful, sometimes melancholy, sometimes just apathetic. I haven\u2019t felt truly happy for so long.\n\nMost times I think I\u2019m not brave enough to do it, that I\u2019ll never succumb to these feelings of just wanting to disappear. But in my darkest moments, it\u2019s begun to feel plausible, and it terrifies me. The other day I found myself thinking about the gun in my husband\u2019s safe. I\u2019d never do anything. But the feelings over the years have gotten more frequent. I feel so terribly, horribly alone. So many nights I just cry before falling asleep, my husband sound asleep next to me, and the loneliness makes me want to scream. He knows somewhat of my struggles, he knows I SH and have thought about death. But it gets tiring of always feeling like a burden because so often I\u2019m down and in tears or just cold. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. I feel so guilty because I feel like I have absolutely no reason to feel this way. I have a good life. Nothing traumatic happened to me. So what\u2019s wrong with my head???\n\nAnyway, I just needed somewhere to place these thoughts tonight so I can stop thinking about disappearing.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oyyxw5/just_need_to_know_im_not_alone/", "title": "Just Need to Know I\u2019m Not Alone", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "blueskies951", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628221914, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oyyxw5/just_need_to_know_im_not_alone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427495.9185143, "replies_charged": false}
