I've called suicide hotlines 4 times this month. I don't feel like there's a point in calling again. It doesn't help me anymore. \n\nI've been suicidal multiple times though out my life. My friends always kept me going. But the pandemic ruined my friendships. Compassion fatigue. Months without seeing anyone. Our friendships were never the same again. And when I started having suicidal thoughts again last year, no one could be there for me. They all gave up on me, until only my 2 closest were left. But they're gone too. One having her own mental health problems, and another investment in his relationship and family and job, with no time left for anyone else. \n\nI've been hurt by people so many times, I'm so filled with anger and fear when interacting with anyone. It used to be just strangers, but now even friends and family and coworkers and teachers and doctors have all traumatized me. Even my cat traumatized me, by dying while I was in the hospital. I loved him so much. I miss him so much. He was the only creature I had let myself fully invest my heart in since I had been cheated on years ago. And I'm completely heartbroken. \n\nSomething is wrong with my brain, or my hormones, or my nervous system. But I've spent years trying to get help. And all I've gotten is useless therapy (I've seen 14 counselors now... Something isn't working) and useless medication (I've tried nearly every antidepressant, and several antianxiety and other calming medications). \n\nI'm not going to kill myself yet, because I'm getting to see a friend for the first time in months on Sunday. And I have ab appointment with a community mental health case worker on Monday. I've already gone through community programs like this twice before and not gotten the help I need. But it's taken me weeks to get this appointment, and it's less than I week away, so even if I starve myself I won't be dead by the time of the appointment. So I might as well go. \n\nI went to the emergency room for stomach pain on Wednesday, so I'm in an Airbnb right now, but the reservation runs out tomorrow and I don't know where I'm gonna go. I've been staying in campgrounds since my relationship with my dad fell apart in May, but I'm so tired, I don't want to search for a campground, I don't want to drive and set everything up. I don't want to figure out what to eat for the next few days. I don't want to deal with waking up at 5am feeling like I'm gonna throw up and having to walk to an outhouse in 45\u00b0 darkness. \n\nThere's so much more I could say.. but it's just pointless. I've written 1-2000 words in a journal multiple days this week, and still I feel no better. \nI wish I would've gotten the help I needed before I was in a whole this deep. I used to have close friends I talked to every day. I used to have a home. I used to be making great money as a programmer. I used to love people. I used to play music. I used to have animals. I used to love life. \n\nI don't want to live anymore", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p3q1sx/im_so_tired/", "title": "I'm so tired", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dicklecopter", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628876183, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p3q1sx/im_so_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423032.275307, "replies_charged": false}
