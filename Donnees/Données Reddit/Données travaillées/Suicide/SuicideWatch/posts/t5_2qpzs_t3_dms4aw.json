I\u2019m not good for much; I apparently can\u2019t even pull my own weight. Do I really want to continue to wait for death? Maybe it would be better if I were to take control for once. I don\u2019t want to live with this torment, my ever-growing list of wrong-doing and regret...\n\nI feel trapped. I doubt I could follow through with suicide; I\u2019m too indecisive and cowardly. I already live by near-constant escapism, and life seems to get more difficult with time. Everything degrades. I don\u2019t want to be here. I don\u2019t think others have made my life especially hellish; I\u2019m just not good enough, not strong enough. I wish it would all go away. It\u2019s too much for me.\n\nFrom what I can see, my options are to die or continue to suffer and then die. Had I the choice, I\u2019d just not exist. Life involves far too much risk and uncertainty and confusion and pain for my liking\u2014but who am I to say how life should be?\n\nI\u2019M TRAPPED, and I\u2019m going to suffer and die pathetically.
