I\u2019ve been making expensive mistakes my whole life and never know if or just how bad I fucked up until it\u2019s desperately too late. \n\nI have this daunting sense of dread that someone is gonna royally fuck me over just around the corner at any fleeting moment. The clock is ticking. I feel like it\u2019s just a matter of time before I\u2019ll make one last fatal misstep and I\u2019ll have my fate handcuffed to some ego-driven sadist\u2019s hands. Either that, or someone will just kick me while I\u2019m down out of a pure whim just for their entertainment and ruin my life for the sport of it. Some people like to hunt witches even if they\u2019re not witches at all. They feign trust and companionship. They veil their true self until  you are of no more use to them. Then, they throw you out their car window on the freeway, turn up the music you would once sing together, and drive away with nothing but selfish, careless thoughts running between their ears. Their brain has been and always will be lysed of guilt and empathy from synapse to synapse.\n\nWell, if I manage to survive the hostile wild just long enough I can be free of my environment\u2019s cruel dangers forever. What a blissful thought. No more brutal, heart-thrashing betrayals. No more bleak, pitch black nights that end with tear soaked pillows. No more... *anything*. It will be the final release from this risk-driven life that will most probably end in another expensive misstep via my self-destructive tendencies or other\u2019s cruel, selfish intentions. The time has come to exercise my selfishness. I am done playing the game and I am above all, done playing by the rules!\n\nNo apathist will force me to forfeit my keys this time around. I simply will not accept it. I am willing to do what it takes to get what I want. I **NEVER** bluff. When I wager something, I have *already* accepted in my mind that I have lost it already. This does not by any means pad the fall, but it chisels the terms. Win or lose.  That being said: fold and we could walk away with both our gilded stacks. Something tells me there\u2019ll be no walking away from this table though. Not this time. Our heads are static and concrete. The old tricks have worn thin and jaded. \n\nI will chew up what is left of this life and spit it out. Savor the taste in my mouth like a virgin tongue coated with its first brisk dew of a warm spring dawn. My final pleasures will be for myself only and shared with no one. I will live more in this final period than I had lived the rest of my prior bleak years. \n\nAnd finally, *with pleasure*, I will lay down for my last cute little nap. You will *never* forget me, but you will *never*  see me again. I know unequivocally that this is what you want from me. I\u2019m just the toy you got for Christmas that you don\u2019t want to play with anymore. Don\u2019t fret one bit, I checked out a **LONG** time ago. Just. like. you. It was dead before it was born and the end will perfectly parallel the beginning.\n\nRemember kids: Santa won\u2019t bring any presents if you\u2019re not asleep! Goodnight.
