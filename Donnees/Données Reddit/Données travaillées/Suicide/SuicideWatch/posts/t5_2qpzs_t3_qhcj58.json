No matter how much I rest it's not enough. I guess I'll rest when I'm dead is really lining up for me huh? I thought about writing a note. I don't have plans yet, just musings about location. Apparently if you die in house that requires hazmat cleaning an that's a lot of money none of the people I know have. So somewhere outside would be nice. I'd need to set up a safe place for people to not find me but still be discoverable. Figure out if there's an app on a timer to call the cops and release some messages to my family that I'm sorry, it's not on them and I love them all but I'm just not made for this world, maybe the next one. I know they love me but... Do you ever wonder why all the love in the world isn't enough to keep some people here? It's because we aren't supposed to be here in the first place. We know it's a life on borrowed time. We're merely meant to observe and we have to go back sooner rather than later. It makes me sad knowing that no matter what I do all that borrowed time is wasted on this situation of a life. But also sad thinking about going overtime and trying to experience more. It's just... Time. Soon. Not today.
