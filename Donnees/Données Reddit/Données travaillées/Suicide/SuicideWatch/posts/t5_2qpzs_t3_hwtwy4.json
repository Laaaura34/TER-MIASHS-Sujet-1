I'm turning 16 in a few days but i really do not want to keep going. At 13 i started to develop an eating disorder (anorexia/bulimia) but it wasn't too bad, recently though (early this year) it started to flare up and its the worst it's ever been. I am so tired of being scared of food and gaining weight. I only have a few online friends who i feel like i'm just a burden to at this point because they are the best thing to happen to me and i feel like i don't deserve them because of how nice they are to me so it feels like i am just baggage to them. Things with my parents aren't the best and I feel like i make things harder for them. I have been in therapy before but it doesn't seem to help.I am really tired of feeling so worthless and depressed so often. My mood swings are so intense and everything comes and goes so i don't know how to control my emotions. there is so much more but i'd rather not reveal it all to strangers on the internet but the cycle never seems to stop and I just feel bad for those around me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hwtwy4/i_dont_wanna_be_here_anymore/", "title": "i dont wanna be here anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "peach-m1lk", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595559407, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hwtwy4/i_dont_wanna_be_here_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422934.4804423, "replies_charged": false}
