Yesterday morning I took over 20 extra strength pain pills trying to attempt. Something to note is they expired 2019 and I am also close to 200 pounds. I slept for 7 hours before waking up. When I woke up I threw up a lot through out the day and felt very tired and nauseated but I started to feel better in the evening. Its the next day now and I feel better, except for a lack of appetite and mild chest pains, but other then that I feel back to normal. Am I okay? I hoped the throwing up cleared my body out and I would now be okay but I'm worried.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ozg2z5/suicide_attempt_aftermath/", "title": "Suicide attempt aftermath", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CarefulThing6998", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628285575, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ozg2z5/suicide_attempt_aftermath/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428543.3794205, "replies_charged": false}
