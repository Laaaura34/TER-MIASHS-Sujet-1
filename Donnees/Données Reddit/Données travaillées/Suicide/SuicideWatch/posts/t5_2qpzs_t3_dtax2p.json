It's been about a month since I last attempted to end my life but it's been getting harder to manage. Today I feel like I'm back in that spot. I haven't done anything yet this time but I'm really scared that I will. I'm scared these emotions will drive my hand. I'm scared I will do something without much thought, something I can't take back, something I may not live to regret. Everytime it gets closer to being fatal. At the beginning of the year I tried stabbing holes in my neck with a bbq skewer. Early September it escalated to cutting my throat with a kitchen knife many times in one go. Last month I tried to overdose on 103 tablets of sodium valproate. Today I'm having thoughts about cutting my neck again I'm trying my best not to but I'm so scared of myself right now I'm in tears as I type this, Begging for a way out. Last time the doctor pointed out on his own neck the vein that delivers oxygen to your brain. I can see it o. My own neck clear as crystal as I have very prominent veins. It would be impossible for me to miss it. If I succeed that's it, there's no undoing it. If I fail I could very well end up being a vegetable for the rest if my life probably wishing I had succeeded or still had the capacity to try it again. I'm in a panic. I need to be stopped. I have no idea what I expect to gain from posting this here but please. Whoever you are. Save me.
