I feel like it's the only way to get what I've always wanted.\n\nSometimes I just want my friend to see this side of me and genuinely care me for once. But I've never had the courage to express how much and how long I have been suicidal for years caused by the same reason, repeating and suffering over and over.\n\nI just wish my friends, family, this world would care me.\n\nAnd I feel like the only way to express it is through suicide. I wish people could see me in the news and pity me.\n\nNo one irl ever knows how much I'm hurt, sad, suicidal. I feel like there's no one around me that I could trust and \ntell my true feelings. It sucks.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading my rant.
