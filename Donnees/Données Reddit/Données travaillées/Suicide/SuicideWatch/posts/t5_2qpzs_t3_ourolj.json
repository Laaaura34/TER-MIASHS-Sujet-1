But right now, I'm considering a voluntary hospitalization for like a day or two just until my anxiety (reaction to meds) gets less crazy and I hopefully am less fixated on overdosing. But I'm also not sure my intent is high enough that I would be able to actually go through with things, versus just obsessing about it and wanting to have enough intent to follow through. So I'm very much on the fence about whether to go or just try and manage it at home to avoid the drama.\n\nAny experiences with admitting yourself to hospital voluntarily?
