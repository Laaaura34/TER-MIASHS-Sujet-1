Every sleepless night all I do is cry nonstop I\u2019m fucking sick of it. Even though I cry I can\u2019t feel anything no happiness no boredom no anger no joy nothing, until I found a solution, I started cutting myself with razor blades, and thanks to that, the emptiness in my body was replaced by something and that was pain, that necessity of feeling something feeling alive for at least a night was too strong for me to handle.\nI have deep cuts from my hip all the way to my ankles and if I ever run out of room or if my leg is too bloody and messy I\u2019ll just start on the other leg and arms. I\u2019m too much of a coward to just end it all with a clean cut to the wrist or neck so I\u2019ll just keep doing it until I die from blood loss on top of my puddle of blood. I\u2019ve been waiting for my demise for so long so I hope every day I do this I\u2019ll be closer to my death I started to feel extremely tired, dizzy and my skin started to look more pale each day, please if there\u2019s a god please make it sooner and just end my suffering, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible to go years and years without crying and feeling like shit for at least one single fucking day. All I do is try to provide for my family all I do is try to live and really tried everything I tried changing my looks, my personality, exercise but never works. I hope my day come soon.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ns9o6a/why_is_mutilating_my_body_the_only_answer/", "title": "Why is mutilating my body the only answer", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Long_Letterhead_1362", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622825381, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ns9o6a/why_is_mutilating_my_body_the_only_answer/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635427048.0266423, "replies_charged": false}
