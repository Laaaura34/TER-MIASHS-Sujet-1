I just finish cutting and scarthing myself and I need something to pass the time since I'm lock in my room. I'm shaking as I'm writing this, so don't be surprise if you see any errors in here. This is a long story so hope you don't mind.\n\nI have anger issues and get annoyed very easily. Typing this out is already making my annoyed. Whenever I feel mad I always cut myself. My heart starts racing and I feel like there's a lump in my throat, which makes my voice sound weird and shakes. My eyes keeps looking everywhere and I start grabbing my hair to cover my face or expression. \n\nI always have a fight with my family. I hate my siblings so very much and feel like I want to kill them. My father doesn't really care about us but he's somehwta religious. I hate my life and everything selse. I hate how I have to control my temper. I hate how I have to think about what I day 24/7 but ended up saying all those hurtful words anyways. \n\nI fucking hate my brother and wishes that he could just drop dead. The only thing that's keeping me through all this is by believing in my religion. I know it's weird but my father's religious things has been rubbing off on me a bit. I scratch myself to death, dig my nails into my skin, and even cut myself using my fingernails over and over until bloods oozes out. I prevent using the scissors, because sometimes I forgot to put it back. My mother always scream like crazy when she can't find the sccirors. I prevent using the knife as well because I usually cook for my siblings with it. My mother is a clean freak, and I guess it got to me a bit. \n\nI'm an introvert and really hate it when someone touches me even if it's on accident. I hate loud noises but my whole family members loves it and are extrovert. I wish I was born like that too. I hate how I look a lot like my mother when she was young. I hatebhow people always say I look so fucking much like that wrench. It's annoys the shit out of me. My sister likes to tease me by poking or touching me. (Not sexually) she knows how I hate it so fucking much but she did it anyways.\n\nMy parents always say that my brother has to be a good example for me and my sister. Because they force that shit on him, my brother is now one of the thing I hate most. You can see by his shitty actions that he cants take a damn fucking joke. I don't know how no one in my fucking family can see it but it irritates the FUCK out of me. I'm not sure if they're blind or pretending not to realize it. \n\nMy sister is a pain in the ass for always doing shit I hate. We share a room and she always uses my clothes without giving them back. Her side of the room is fucking messy and she has the damn audacity to place her guitar on my side. I told her counteless times that we agree on placing our own things is our respective side of the room. But she keeps saying we share a room, and my side is her side as well. Dumb bitch. She came up with that deal and decided to break it.\n\nEveryday I feel like I want to run away or just kill myself. I kept on thinking about running away to my best friend's house, but she has her own problems as well. She always tells me what's on her mind and if she has any problems with her family. I like how she's doing better and starts opening up to me. She use to cut herself and it makes me very worried. She had to go to counseling in our school once because the teacher saw the cuts. I hope she's doing okay now. I want to tell her about my problems as well, but I'm not ready and I'm afraid of telling people my opinion and what's weighing on my mind. I have been best friend's with her for more than 6 years I think, but it still doesn't change the fact that I'm scare of opening up. You see, I don't have that much freidna but I do have acquaintances. I have this habit of picking the right frens. Out of all my friends I always get 90% that are loyal and love me for who I am. I change districts at the age of 12 I think because of my father's job. My childhood was shit. I live in an Asian household, my parents are very strict then, and use to beat me with everything thing they can find in the house. \n\nI remember this one time, (I was in Kindergarten) where I was crying and screaming, my grandmother (my mother's side) hated it so much she took keys and threw it at my face. (Mostly my mouth) The next day, I kept touching my gums. My friend saw and ask me what happens o my gums, because it was bleeding a little and was very red. I just told them it's nothing and cried quietly, remembering the incident about day before. My grandmother keeps asking which grandmother I love more, her (my mother's side) or my other grandmother (my father's side). And when I say I love both equally she gave me a disgusted look while glaring and said \"I was the one who took care of you and stayed with you\". What kinda fuckery shit is that?? My other grandmother took care of me as well. And they're both my grandmother. You can't just save one and kill the other can you? My other grandmother from my father's side is very sweet and I love her so much.\n\nMy life is so fuck up. But I keep telling myself it's not and that there are other people who are suffering more than me. And that I shouldn't me selfish and think about myself. I have never tell anyone about my problems let alone my experiences. Just thinking about people reading this is already giving me anxiety. \n\nI personally don't think I am diagnose with anything or have any mental health problems. But, I always make a big deal of everything. Like when I walk in a crowd I feel like everyone has their eyes on my or whispering about me. I know it's not true and that why would they pay attention to a stranger like me, but it's just my thoughts okay? Even when I'm talking to someone I feel like they're judging me in their head. I sometimes feel bad about my sister because she was the only one who could put up with my shitty attitude. Remember how I said I have anger issues? After we fight she was always the one to reach out to me. Even if she annoys the fuck out of me I just cant help but feel bad for her. I don't think this problem of mine is called delusional. Maybe most people have this too. I just feel like everyone is thinking negative things towards me. I'm always overthinking things. Every damn thing. I want to stop it by I just can't. It makes me feel insecure and scare about all those thoughts. \n\nMy sister is actually the exact opposite of me. She always say that she dont want to hate anybody because she say it's bad. She always make this squeky kiddy voice and act cute in front of my parents. I'm not against it but it just irritates me. My parents like it and is giving her more love. I'm not complaining, because I don't like reaching out to people even if it's my family. My father and sister are very fond of each other. My mother loves my brother too because he's very smart and can even be a doctor. I know I'm being overly sensitive, but I've been studying people movements and I always want, in my case, need to know everyone's schedules. I always try to predict what they're gonna say or do next even in a simple game like rock paper scissors. Its a habit I picked up after being bullied for my whole childhood, in order to get ready for being bullied again. I went to this school for rich people, but my family was average, thus making me at the lowest 'food chain'. I was around the last year of my kindergarten, the bullying started. \n\n(Present time) There was this old lady who lives across the street 2 house to the right from me. She was very kind and the thing we have in common is that we both love gardening. We stop seeing each other face to face because of the pandemic but we wave to each other every time we saw one another's. Her husband just died recently, which was  last year or the beginning of this year. Ever since then I rarely saw her coming out of her house. I remembered we made a deal that when her pineapple plant grows and bear fruit she will give me one. Her plant were covered in weed and it seems that some of her plants were dying too.\nI just hope that she will get better soon. \n\nMy grandfather from my father's side pass away 2 months ago. He has amnesia and the only person he remember is his wife even if he lives with his daughter which is my aunty. He always shout my grandmother's name even if she in the kitchen, toilet or anywhere in the house. I rarely meet him, but thinking that he died without even having any fun memories with his grandchildren hurts me so much. I know my cousins doesn't hate me. But I have a feeling they they resent me and my family for not always being there with them. I have a feeling that they are always discussing among themselves how terrible I am. And that I only show up on the day he died. I hate how I'm always having these negative thoughts that I'm not even sure are true or not.\n\nI wish that I was never born. If I have never existed, everything could've change. My grandfather wouldn't have amnesia and pass away early, my family won't fight much, my father would love my family and treat them with care, my best friend could live a better life, and that everything would just be happy without me around ruining everything. \n\nI always think that if I had one wish, I wish for world peace and everyone would love one another. But now, I'm not sure if I can keep up with that thinking. I used to be optimistic and think that everything will be okay. After years of waiting, it doesn't change. Why? Why must people live an awful and miserable life? Why can't everyone lives happily? If I could just die and take all the sufferings from this world with me, I'll gladly do so. Could I have changed everything if I don't have anger issues? Would everything be better if I just kept being optimistic and stop having all these thoughts? I'm not even sure if I have anger issues or not, if I have depression or any mental health problems. How can someone know if they have depression?  Everyone just keeps assuming and saying they have depression. I don't want to offend anyone of has that, thus I stop myself from even thinking of it. My happy and optimistic personally ended when I was 12 I think, I was when I change districts and away from the bullying and toxic place. \n\nI don't know why I'm like this. I want to try therapy but it's embarrassing to have it and it's expensive. And I'm still living under my parents roof. They don't know what I'm thinking or why I'm like this either. I can feel that both my siblings hates me so much and wishes that I could just die. Especially my brother, I just know it. I just finish the scratching and cutting, I've call down for a while now and have come to my senses. I remember what my brother said to my father earlier after we fought. \n\nB = brother.\nD = Dad.\nM = Me.\n\nI just finished fighting with my brother and was sitting on the sofa with my hands grabbing my hair.\n\nD : Why are you guys fighting again?! We just finished praying and you're fighting. B just ignore her.\n\nB : You can't always do this! If you keep on ignoring her she will get worse\n\nM : What do you mean worse?!? You started it first and now you're saying I'll get worse!?\n\nAt this point I was at the verge of wanting to cut myself. I want to go up to my room and cut myself but I also want to hear the conversation so I was restraining myself from moving.\n\nB : You shut up. You're always like this, getting mad at everything. You think everyone likes you? (Thats why you have such little friends. I dont think they even like you.) \n\nWhen he says the part with the (), I'm not even sure if he really said that or not. I feel like he said it in his head by seeing his expression. I'm not so sure because whenever I'm angry my head gets really hot and I was try to calm down to prevent myself from passing out. \n\nM : *I was just mumbling cuss words* \n\nIt was not loud because cursing is a very big deal in my family. And I was grabbing my head to try to cool it down. At this point my head was really really hot and I had to clam down so I went into my room. I slam myself on my bed, took my pillow and cover my face, I grab my bolster to make a wall while hugging it and cover myself with my blanket. Whenever I feel stress or feel like having a mental break down, I do this. Because it feels like I'm being hug or love. I just felt like it because the black wraps around my body, my pillow is covering my ears from listening to all the nasty words, and I have the bolster to support me as I hug it. This is all in my head and I know they're not real but it helps me. It calms me a little but it wasn't enough because I kept shaking. You know when you're on the verge of crying you have that hiccup thing? Yeah I felt like that. I didn't want to make any noises and show them what I'm feeling or my emotions so I tried to shut my mouth by biting on it or my tongue. I don't know why, but whenever I cut myself and felt the pain or see blood, it helps me know that everything is real, I'm real, and what I'm feeling is real. \n\nWhenever someone wakes me up when I'm sleeping I get so emotional and get frustrated. I sleep early but wake up late because of my dreams. My dreams are mostly good ones. I always had nice dreams and I could control it every time. It helps me escape from reality. I am aware that it's a dream when I'm dreaming. I don't know how I can do this since everyone keeps saying you can't control your dream all the time or aware that it's a dream but I just can. \n\nRemember the fight I had with him? The one where my father said to just ignore me and my brother said \"she'll get worse\"? If you're wondering what we're fighting then here's how it went. \n\nWe just finished praying, we pray every night as a whole family because my father is religious or sum. I was really sleepy and had my second dose from the covid-19 vaccine 2 days ago. And my period is coming soon. I covered myself in my jacket, making it very clear than I was sleeping and didn't want to be disturb. Suddenly I heard a shitty scream directly and my fucking ear. I was so damn shock and almost had a heart attack thinking something happen. But guess fucking what. It was that dickhead of a brother of mine that was screaming. I was so irritated and let it go. It was rare of me to let something like that go but I was really sleepy that time and didn't have the energy to fight. \n\nRemember how I said my mom was a clean freak? Me and my brother had to mop the living room floor everyday at night, we took turns. Tonight was his turn and so he has to push the sofa in order to mop the front part of the living room. I was sleeping on the sofa at that time which was just a few hours ago. Usually when we push the sofa we would do it gently to prevent any scratching noises on the wooden floor. It's just what our mom told us to do so we just followed whatever she said. But since just now I kinda got mad at him for SCREAMING at MY EAR while I was ASLEEP. He roughly pull the sofa from behind, with every stop I would bonce in front, just like hitting the brakes on a very fast moving car. I know he did that shit on purpose. He pulled short but fucking big pulls just to annoy me and make me bounce while I sleep. I tried to ignored it which was rare of me to do so. But every pull and stop was rougher and shorter, on the third pull I had enough and got angry at him. He had the fucking audacity to get mad at ME for SLEEPING on the COUCH. WTF?? The whole damn family sleeps on it. My father slept on it once and I had to push the sofa/couch by myself WITHOUT help! My father is 80-90 kg and I'm 40-50 kg. How can I be heavier and harder to pull than him?! Not to mention, I have noodle arms! They fucker of a brother did it on purpose I tell you. He didn't even fucking say sorry for screaming at my damn ear while I was asleep, or even waking me up like shit. And he said I'll get worse?! You speak English bitch? Do you even hear yourself? Egghead bitchknob or a shit eating fuck face. And that's how I ended up in my room right now while typing my someone of my other experiences. \n\nHere's another one. My mother always went ballistic when she saw me waking up late. This one time were I woke up at 4pm and she came home from work, she was screaming her head out. I know it's my fault, I was really scare of her and that time. Whenever she gets mad at me she would beat me up with almost anything. She was choking me this one time and I was beg her to forgive me many times, but she wouldn't. My father was really strict as well but he doesn't pay much attention to us. My mother never gives us privacy and always has her suspicions on us when we went to our room and lock the door. So privacy was never there. \n\nMy brother is now going in to university and I really can't wait for him to go. I've been longing for this day for way too long. If he's gone, all my worries will be ease a bit. I don't want to say much about him because I really hate him. I don't want him to die out there because I rather him dying in my hands. I know it's rather harsh and I'm just saying it because I'm mad. But everyone can't think rationally when they're mad right?\n\nJust now my sister went into our shared room which is where I'm in rn. And she wanted to take a pant. I act like I just woke up. This was how our convo went.\n\nSister : You should sleep with the lights off. \n\nShe was very considerate and kind but I snap at her and said\n\nMe : let me sleep how I want \n\nI said it in a harsh tone. When she went out and lock the doors behind her. I realize what I did and felt really regretful. Sometimes I hate her and sometimes I don't. I kept saying she's one of the person I hate the most. But when I can back to my senses I know it's not true. She's literally the opposite of me. She could even come with my attitude when the rest of the family can't. She called me kind when my other family members said I'm rude and nothing but negativity. I pray and hope that when I do at some point couldn't bear it anymore and commit suicide, she still be her happy and kind self. And that her memories of me could maybe get erase. I don't want her to remember a person like me as her sister. I feel like a disgrace and a happy baby should've been born instead of me. Or another life could've been safe instead of me existing. \n\nI don't want to continue any further because I feel uncomfortable having people knowing my problems and my thoughts. This is my very first time saying my thoughts out loud even if it's through text. I felt relieved knowing there's at least one person listening. Even if there isn't, at least I get to say post this like a diary. I was afraid of having one because I'm scare my family would found it. Thank you for listening to my story. I'm sorry if I have bothered you or took to much of your time.
