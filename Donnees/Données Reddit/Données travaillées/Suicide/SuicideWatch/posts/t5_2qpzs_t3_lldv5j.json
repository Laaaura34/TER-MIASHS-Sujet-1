I was forced into this degree at 17 and I was too young and naive to say no. I have worked tirelessly for the past 6 years but I feel like I'm going nowhere. I have lost half the hair on my head and most of my friends because I spent 90% of my time holed up in some library studying. \nI don't see anything in front of me other than at least another decade of studying. My parents are old and I cannot afford a career switch at this point. I haven't done anything I liked doing since I was around 17. I'm depressed and as someone who knows the basics of depression Ik I fulfill most criteria. I cannot afford a therapist and mental health is taboo in my part of the world. \nI cry myself to sleep at night and I think about the least painful ways to kill myself. Most of my friends in med school are equally depressed so that doesn't help either. One guy I knew working towards the last step of his medical licensing exam actually killed himself last month. All doctors in my country have to work unbelievably hard to get our licenses and to get through med school, but are in turn heavily overworked and underpaid. This will be my future even after grad and it's not what I want my life to be.\n\n At this point the  only reason im living is because ik my parents would never make it through if something happened to me. \nI'm just so tired. So so tired. Ever since I was in middle school I have worked tirelessly at school and never taken a break. Even at age 13 I was drinking coffee and staying up till 3am studying or doing something extracurricular like model UN research. I'm 23 but I feel 60. \nPls help, what can I do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lldv5j/help/", "title": "Help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "withmeth", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613510154, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lldv5j/help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428462.49274, "replies_charged": false}
