I spend my days going to school, and sitting around playing video games or watching youtube. Existence is so absurd in my eyes. I do not understand why we are even here. We all do not understand why we are here. We are just here. Why is it that some are fated to get to have some happiness (which i believe is only possible temporarily), while others are fated to just be lonely, have a miserable family life, or are just deal with misery with no slice of that happiness pie? I am just so tired of existing and am just ready to fucking off myself. I have done nothing but what has been expected of my by society (make good grades, get a good degree, go to graduate school to further my education and expand potential financial earnings), but I can just never seem to get any other happiness. I have anxiety so bad about the existential i can't even go get gas for my car without feeling panicky. I am just so depressed. I hate my family life, I hate everything. I do not understand women, I do not understand my family, i cannot make a meaningful connection in this life. I have tried therapy, I have tried medication, yet nothing helps.
