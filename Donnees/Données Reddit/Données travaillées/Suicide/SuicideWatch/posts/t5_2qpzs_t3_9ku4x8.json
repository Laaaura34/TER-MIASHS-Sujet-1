Week then contest what I\u2019m bring to the table. I don\u2019t think blaming anyone is going to prove just. Holding people responsible for their actions over others and how they are known to wait and manipulate over others. Then yes I suppose I\u2019m to blame for twisting and manipulating what I think to not match what the status quo thinks. I\u2019m not here for that. But I know who I was over the fact that people have and will say whatever they want about people to cover up what they have said about people. When I assume I only have good thing to say about people? I\u2019m sorry if that the case I\u2019m dead tomorrow.. and you all can keep you lives over knowing that I haven\u2019t been listen to over a thing any white community along with one or two attacker\u2019s have been able to put out black people for a very long time. I don\u2019t hate anyone but their attitudes. Why should I give anyone a chance over this alleged selfishness of my part. I hope that some day I know enough better of my self to be able to show anyone that they were wrong and that it just effects them and not me.\n\nIn me knowing that I don\u2019t have or need anything has been the worst pain Ive know; and slcast them out as delusions. To the point where I\u2019m desperate to not have any thoughts feelings or possessions. Just cause it\u2019s hard to see, want to believe, or know that I was raped and molested and racially impugnated from my life honor and what I hold dear. Why would I want to try for any of you. Not that I still don\u2019t regardless around the ideas of my own poverty and what I have and haven\u2019t known. If it at all matters I don\u2019t need or want anything to do with me, them, then. Anymore than him, they, and those; types of people even if they are just shitty kids.\n\nI don\u2019t care about every tid bit of my being miss conditioned or irresponsible have to do with my situation, cause I\u2019ve just been that to people when I would consider me at my best summer going into frogs, froshyear, and the summer after, leading to the whole of sophomore year until I was sexually raped and molested for racial prejudice and pandering over who I was, and entitlement issue consequence by everyone but me to this situation. My mom during this time was just as if not more abusive to me then my dad ever was but I still hold them both in the same regard and court for being not their for me, for this very reason.. I was anything other then trying to be myself and as secure as I could be.\n\nBeing bullied at school and at home left me with an estranged social circle that may never recover from what has been done to me not for me. Even if it took eight years to come to terms with what really happened and keeps ruining my life with these actual friends family and Sarah..\n\n\nI want to die because I don\u2019t think I could show everyone where this has put me out from people that I actually care about. Around the fact of who has let me be myself and respected my boundaries, the people that didn\u2019t; and if at all I recognize them. I\u2019m not sorry for being mad. I\u2019m a better person the the madness they make of me but me knowing why I\u2019m upset in my: inhibitions and morals, has let me know that I\u2019m the same as I was and people are being manipulated around that. Because they hate distrust or just don\u2019t like themselves; professionally, socially, or in and with friends and family. Either way I don\u2019t how to care anymore I want to die because I\u2019m better then Their ideals or plans for Themselves and where They\u2019d leave me to rot regardless of what They say or think. Who They and and what They\u2019ve wanted from me. Based on others or Their disrespect. And how They rather have what They have to say over me saying that I\u2019ve been hurt by them.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9ku4x8/civil_defense_iii/", "title": "Civil Defense III", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "young_mof", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1538510979, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9ku4x8/civil_defense_iii/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426459.5553527, "replies_charged": false}
