All I have is my father, who abuses me, and my cat, who I love very much.  Two days ago I bought a bag of cocaine. I had never done drugs before in my life. I enjoyed using it. I've never had so much fun before. Today I plan to buy more. I would like to have enough cocaine to overdose on. I'll see how much I need to die. I'm tired of suffering. My father abuses me every day. I'm a loser. I have social anxiety. I'm a virgin because I'm always rejected, and that adds to my anxiety.
