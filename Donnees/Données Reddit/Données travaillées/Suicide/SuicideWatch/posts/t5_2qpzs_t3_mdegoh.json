I just cant help but feel guilty when i hear of death. Like im the one here who has tried so many times to go, and someone who wanted to be alive has been taken. It\u2019s like i cant help but think that should have been me.\n\nThey had plans for their future, excitement, goals, they wanted to be here they wanted to be something. And i dread every day that i wake up, i put off going to sleep for hours on end just so that the next day doesn\u2019t come so soon. I hate it here. And someone who actually wanted a part in this was taken away.\n\nJust makes me feel guilty for being alive when ive tried so hard not to be. Like it hits me and i feel like the most ungrateful little shit.\n\nThis is so repetitive because i dont even know if it makes sense, but it really brings me down differently. Like i should have gone, not them", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mdegoh/survivors_guilt/", "title": "survivors guilt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "XNH1NGED", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616725031, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mdegoh/survivors_guilt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426198.8693552, "replies_charged": false}
