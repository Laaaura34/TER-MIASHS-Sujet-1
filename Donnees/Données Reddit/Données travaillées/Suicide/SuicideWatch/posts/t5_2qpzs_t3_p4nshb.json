People who were supposed to protect and care for me neglected and attacked me. They treated me less than human. Less than anyone else around them. I had to fight for basic human decency, I had to fight just to show any expression of emotion, for any display of companionship, for any symbol of life, for any bit of human compassion.\n\nA mistake by my hand meant the apocalypse; a mistake by anyone elses' was treated appropriately. Punishments for the tiniest rule were treated as murder; For everyone else, appropriately. The difference in how people treat me versus everyone else is disgusting.\n\nThe positives of anything were stripped from me, and they poured their negatives onto me.\n\nI had no control of my life. All I want is control of my death. I want to die with dignity; I'll have to fight for that too. Nothing is more dehumanizing than knowing you can't pick your own life-- or death. I won't suffer any longer.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p4nshb/ive_never_had_control_let_me_control_my_death/", "title": "I've never had control; Let me control my death", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SilenceHacker", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629005889, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p4nshb/ive_never_had_control_let_me_control_my_death/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423010.3519304, "replies_charged": false}
