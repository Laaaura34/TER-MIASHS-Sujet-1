Like even when you try to do good things for yourself, any positive outcome is very short lived? I just feel like I can\u2019t get a fucking break. \nI really don\u2019t want to write a whole post bitching, but it\u2019s just SO frustrating. Every time I have something good or feel like I\u2019m starting the process of getting my shit together, the universe is just like \u201cfuck you\u2026 nah, you thought\u201d. It\u2019s just a joke.
