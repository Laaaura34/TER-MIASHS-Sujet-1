Nobody els. So what kind of bullshit is it that ur supposed to stay alive to stop from hurting other people? I just don\u2019t get it. The last thing I ever want is to hurt anybody. At the same time tho, I just want peace. The only way is suicide. I don\u2019t want anybody to reach out with there comments, I don\u2019t want help. I don\u2019t want some,\u201dI made it you can too speech\u201d. It\u2019s all rubbish. If someone has dug themselves out of a mental hole than that\u2019s amazing, and couldn\u2019t be happier for you. I kno for me I\u2019ve dug myself out far to many times just to eventually be brought back to the same place. This isint a pitty party. The reason I am where I am today is all on me, nobody\u2019s fault but my own. \n\nI just can\u2019t wait until I have the courage to go threw with it. I\u2019m tired man, 27 years old and I\u2019m just tired. I just don\u2019t have the energy or the drive anymore to try anymore I really don\u2019t. It wount be today, and it wount be tomorrow, but some day soon. It\u2019s gonna be all over, although it makes me sad that I will miss lived ones. I\u2019ve lived a good life, I\u2019ve just had enough.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mrjc1s/to_be_guilted_into_staying_alive_is_bullshit/", "title": "To be guilted into staying alive is bullshit", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheOhioState420", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618507023, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mrjc1s/to_be_guilted_into_staying_alive_is_bullshit/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426199.3883736, "replies_charged": false}
