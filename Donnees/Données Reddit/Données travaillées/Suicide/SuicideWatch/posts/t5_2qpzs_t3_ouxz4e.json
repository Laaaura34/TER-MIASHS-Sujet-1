I have been rejected because a girl found out that I\u2019m on meds. I feel so unlovable in this state. Without the meds I am worthless and can\u2019t even hold a job. When I\u2019m on them I do reasonably well and currently have a well paying job. I don\u2019t want to settle for a life of perpetual loneliness. Thought about ending it for a while now. Why am I so dependent on sex and not feeling lonely? \n\nI think I\u2019m never going to bring kids into this world because I don\u2019t want them to deal with sexual failure and rejection either. \n\nI know this is ridiculous and I should just suck it up.
