I leave offices in a worse state, I disassociate and tell them straight up what the problems are. In return its always: \"Im sorry this has happened to you\" \"that sounds rough\"  \n\n\nI moved back in with my family, the two years I was gone I was emotionally abused by my ex, got fired from 7 jobs due to anixety. I would throw up at work. Therapy made me feel worse. I was manipulated into sex. Had to go to the hospital. My family shows me how worthless I am.   \n\n\nI met an amazing person during that time. I dont want to hurt them, but I am living away right now. I know that if I move back as planned, It will all fall apart again. I know that I cant do it because \"trying\" isnt good enough. It was never good enough.   \n\n\nI wont be able to pursue what matters to me, but even then, it doesnt matter much anymore. I had dreams of what my life COULD be, but thats gone. I dont want to hurt that amazing person, but I know that grief is just a phase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm not good enough to keep trying, Im not good enough for myself.
