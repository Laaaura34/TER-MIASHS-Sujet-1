I just don't know what to do anymore I don't have the energy to try to even fight it anymore I just want to rot away in a corner", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nlb7z0/no_help/", "title": "no help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "whatabouttheclouds", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622015000, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nlb7z0/no_help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422269.9828508, "replies_charged": false}
