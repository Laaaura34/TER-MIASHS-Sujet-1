So now I\u2019m asking again. Why do people keep saying \u201cNoo don\u2019t commit suicide, your not alone\u201d or \u201cIf you commit suicide you\u2019ll just pass the pain to someone else\u201d Why do people try to \u201csave\u201d us like if one sentence if gonna give us a sudden change of heart. I know they\u2019re just trying to be kind but it gets old really fast. Plus the same person who said they\u2019ll be with me no matter what left me, they all left me at the end. So close to ending it all for multiple reasons. So no NOTHING IS OKAY, NOTHING WILL EVER BE OKAY, ILL ALWAYS BE ALONE WITH MY STRUGGLES NO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TRY TO HELP. YES YOUR TRYING TO BE NICE BY HELPING ME BUT HOW CAN I BE SURE YOU WITH PLAY WITH MY FEELINGS. ILL ALWAYS JUST BE AN OBJECT FOR OTHERS TO PLAY AROUND WITH AND NOT A HUMAN PERSON, ITS WHAT I DESERVE HUMANITY IS JUST PAYING ME BACK", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pj8wi4/why_do_people_wanna_save_me_from_committing/", "title": "Why do people wanna \u201csave\u201d me from committing suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Hot-Alternative6368", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630963561, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pj8wi4/why_do_people_wanna_save_me_from_committing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428337.127465, "replies_charged": false}
