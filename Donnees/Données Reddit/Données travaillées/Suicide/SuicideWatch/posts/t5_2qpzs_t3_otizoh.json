I also have my own business that does well. None of it means anything, it all just makes me feel more stuck in my current circumstances and life. \n\nTruth is I\u2019ve been suicidal for over a year, I have letters written, plans in place but I just can\u2019t commit to a date. I have no idea how to get out of this pointless life, there is no point to any of this. Work yourself to death so that you can retire then die. Suicide honestly seems to be a logical short cut when you weigh the years of work and sacrifice vs the ones your supposed to enjoy later in life. \n\nI came close a few months back but couldn\u2019t follow through. I am even more determined now though. Every day is just a chore, and I don\u2019t see the benefit on the other side of it all. \n\nI used to be healthy and really active, I can\u2019t even get motivated to leave the house any more. My lifestyle has deteriorated into a substance abuse binge eating loop, I\u2019m pretty well finished with all this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/otizoh/im_successful_but_suicidal_as_hell/", "title": "I\u2019m \u201csuccessful\u201d but suicidal as hell", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Fickle-Pineapple-513", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627506255, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/otizoh/im_successful_but_suicidal_as_hell/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428203.5790937, "replies_charged": false}
