There were unhealthy elements but I've dated other people and I know how it sounds to say this but, I've truly never had the same connection with anyone. I am 100% positive there is no one I will ever click with like that again. \n\nI cheated I lied about it, it blew up in face rightfully so, I don't even know why I did it. It was just an escape from what little I had going for me, which was really toxic of me, and of course I wish I did it differently but I can't.\n\nNow I am sitting with just me and my nothing and the future seems shitty and I don't want it or really deserve it anyway, excuse the self-pity.\n\nSo I wanna die, I really do. Its the only thought that makes me feel any better.\n\nI'm scared to be honest, kinda nervous coz I believe its going to be nothing on the other side which is good but kind of scary. I'm also not sure how to do it. I live with my parents and my brother and I don't want to traumatize them. That also makes me feel F'ed up about it, I don't wanna put them through that coz they do care.\n\nI just want to die", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqn1xw/i_feel_like_i_ruined_my_life_and_i_wanna_die/", "title": "I feel like I ruined my life and I wanna die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Futile_Tea", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631973941, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqn1xw/i_feel_like_i_ruined_my_life_and_i_wanna_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423155.3691769, "replies_charged": false}
