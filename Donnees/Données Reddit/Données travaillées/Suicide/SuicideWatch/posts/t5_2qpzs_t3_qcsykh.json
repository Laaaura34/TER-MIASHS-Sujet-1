No-one understands, no-one can help me, and I feel so alone I can\u2019t stand it. I never thought I\u2019d have to live past 18/19, yet here I am, stuck here with maybe 2 reasons to be glad about it, or at least to keep drawing in air, one of which I may be forced to lose, the other I\u2019ll lose one day anyway when my cat dies of old age.\n\nThe whole reason I feel like giving up on myself is because it feels like the world and everyone I know already has. Yet they tell ME to keep fighting! Fight with what? With what fucking energy do you expect me to keep going? For what reason should I stay, just so YOU don\u2019t have to feel fucking guilty and get inconvenienced by my death, is that it? So all the assholes you know don't start gossiping about how your kid topped themselves? So YOU don\u2019t have to feel like you were bad parents?\n\nI\u2019m so tired. I\u2019m alone, and I don\u2019t know how to keep going in a world where the only two reasons I have to live could disappear on me at any time and leave me with nothing and no-one. I\u2019m not strong enough for this, I\u2019m weak and pathetic and nothing but a burden. I wish I was better, but I can\u2019t seem to be, no matter how hard I try. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m such a fuck-up. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m alive.
