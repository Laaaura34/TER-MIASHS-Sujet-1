The only thing I feel is anger but even that goes by fast. My mom is abusive I can\u2019t last until I turn 18. My sister is awful yet things only go good when she\u2019s home. She left yesterday now I\u2019m stuck with our mom. Cps is horrible and can\u2019t actually help me. \n\nI try to think about how much better my life would be if my dad was alive. In reality he would just be beating the shit out of me everyday. \n\nI don\u2019t feel love. I don\u2019t feel happiness or comfort. I hate my body. I hate my face. I hate my life. To think days ago I was working on my art portfolio and now I can\u2019t even get out of bed. \n\nI haven\u2019t eaten a real meal in days. I can\u2019t afford food or water anymore. Not unless I steal from my mom and I can\u2019t do that. I haven\u2019t even started high school yet and I already want to die. \n\nI\u2019ve wanted to die since I was 9. I\u2019m finally gonna do it. I\u2019m doing it Wednesday. I hope I die before then", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q0pmqd/i_have_nothing_left_to_live_for/", "title": "I have nothing left to live for", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "willsmithonice", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633291654, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q0pmqd/i_have_nothing_left_to_live_for/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426865.534429, "replies_charged": false}
