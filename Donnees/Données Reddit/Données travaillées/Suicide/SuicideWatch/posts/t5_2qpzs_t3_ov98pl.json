It's just practice though, I'm just testing the waters right now, testing if my inhibitions of killing myself will be countered by alcohol. So far, drinking is making me numb and oddly making me free and pleasantly buzzed. Weird. I think I'm really going to go through with it tomorrow night.\n\nIt's 23:18PM in my country now. Tomorrow I'm aiming to drinking myself silly to really go through with my attempt. Hopefully, by early morning 2 days from now I'm gone. My family will be calling me for breakfast, and after not hearing from me in my room, they will be breaking my locked door, only to see me slumped on my futon, a rope strangling me, tied from an eye hook on the wall for my hammock. I am not eating nor drinking anything tomorrow. I read that death makes you shit and piss yourself. No, thank you, I won't be embarrassing myself anymore after dying. \n\nCheers, sub. I ahve been responding to some posts that raelly connected with me. for some bried moments i felt their hardships too and that makes my life less lonely. i hope they got whta they were looking for, either in life or death. \n\nPaalam.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ov98pl/rehearsal/", "title": "rehearsal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "madalumdom", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627745614, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ov98pl/rehearsal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426410.712511, "replies_charged": false}
