My dad died when I was 14 and it\u2019s just me and my mum. I\u2019m 26 now but I still mourn the loss of my dad like it happened yesterday. She\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m trying not to kill myself, at least while she\u2019s still around. When I was younger I thought that if I died I\u2019d get to see my dad again but then I lost belief in god or even that possibility happening but I still want it to end sometimes cos I\u2019m so exhausted of just feeling sad and alone. \n\nI have a boyfriend who doesn\u2019t understand or try to understand nor empathise with me. Sometimes I wish he would just tell me he loves me even though I\u2019m depressed or even though I have anxiety :\u2019(\n\nSomeone tell me it gets better and that I won\u2019t always feel like this. Someone tell me i don\u2019t have to die for it to go away", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ojc9x2/i_close_my_eyes_and_think_of_killing_myself/", "title": "I close my eyes and think of killing myself sometimes", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "xxaydiv", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626169677, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ojc9x2/i_close_my_eyes_and_think_of_killing_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426788.2158709, "replies_charged": false}
