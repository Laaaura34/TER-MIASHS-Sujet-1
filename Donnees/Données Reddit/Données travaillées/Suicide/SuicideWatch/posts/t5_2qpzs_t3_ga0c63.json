The only two options are recovery and suicide. Of course I want to get better, but I honestly can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s like to live for any purpose other than placating the abusive voice in my head. The thought of ever achieving freedom and recovery feels completely out of reach. I genuinely cannot see myself ever getting better. All I want is to just give up.\n\nI wish I had the courage to commit suicide. I dream of going back to uni, spending a month or two eating as much as I fucking want and being high all day and finally dying once I\u2019ve distanced myself enough from loved ones.  \n\nI am repeatedly told that \u201crecovery is the hardest thing you\u2019ll ever do\u201d, and honestly if that\u2019s true I can\u2019t imagine how bad it\u2019s going to be. Even if I do fully recover and get my life back, I know that the pain I have to experience to get there will be so much worse than anything I\u2019ve had before. I don\u2019t know if I have the strength or if it\u2019s even worth it. I want to hide from the world and eat and eat and smoke and eat and die.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ga0c63/id_rather_die_than_endure_the_pain_of_recovering/", "title": "I\u2019d rather die than endure the pain of recovering from anorexia", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "emeraldenchiladas", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1588124287, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ga0c63/id_rather_die_than_endure_the_pain_of_recovering/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422252.0619478, "replies_charged": false}
