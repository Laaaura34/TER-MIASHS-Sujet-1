To have sex. The goal was to feel better, knowing that no longer being a virgin could give me some self esteem. Or at least I'd have an excuse not to think about it.\n\nBut even by paying for it, I couldn't have an intercourse. \n\nI fucking hate my body. I hate being a man. I hate all of this. I'm a living failure as a male.\n\nI just wanted to know that maybe I still didn't met the right girl, but no.\nMy destiny is to be alone. For fucking ever.\nNo wife, no friend, no kids, just keep doing the same job and keep doing nerdy things for all eternity.\n\nMy life is irremediably damaged and cannot be fixed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nn7ou3/im_a_failure_as_a_man/", "title": "I'm a failure as a man", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Mello39Wright", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 591, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622236044, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nn7ou3/im_a_failure_as_a_man/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426916.4500349, "replies_charged": false}
