I want help - but at the same time I don't because I feel like it just won't make a difference? I don't want to let my family down by going back again, especially after lying to them and saying I have been doing better, but I don't know what to do anymore at this point.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mo9rsw/when_to_go_inpatient/", "title": "When to go inpatient?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwingafterthisk", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618077979, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mo9rsw/when_to_go_inpatient/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423040.570482, "replies_charged": false}
