I\u2019ve been suicidal but functional for quite some time but now I  just can\u2019t take  it anymore.  For background info, I\u2019ve suffered from depression and anxiety since my teenage years. I currently see a therapist and on medication but it doesn\u2019t seem to be helping much. I\u2019m a nightshift  RN with 3 kids and I\u2019m BEYOND burnt out. The 12 hrs shifts, the constant stress, the insomnia, the patients, fucking Covid, I can\u2019t stand it anymore. Also l, my 2yr old is non verbal and being evaluated for autism. He is in speech, OT, and development therapies during the week, to try to get him talking. So there\u2019s the normal terrible twos on top of constant whining, watching for non verbal cue\u2019s so he doesn\u2019t get frustrated, planning and doing activities all day so he gets tired out by bedtime. Not to mention the clean up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m living with Taz the Tasmanian devil, he destroys everything. I can\u2019t go to the bathroom without a mess being made somewhere. When he is finally in bed, I then have two other kids that need my help and attention. My whole life is taking care of people and I\u2019m tired. Im so very tired. My husband shares in the responsibilities but even with his help I\u2019m overwhelmed. I hate my life. I absolutely hate it. I wake up and I\u2019m immediately ready to cry because my life is over yet. I have to wake up and do it all over again. I keep telling myself, my kids need me and I have to keep going but I\u2019m slowly starting not to care anymore. I just want to die. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll do it but, it won\u2019t be long though.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/poy0qn/waiting_for_the_end/", "title": "Waiting for the end", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jessthedestructive", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631736962, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/poy0qn/waiting_for_the_end/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426569.2267456, "replies_charged": false}
