She was 57, and I am 28. \n\nNo father. I\u2019m alone. I am stressed from life, loss, and handling her things without a will. \n\nOne other person close to me; spends time with me but not \u201cpresent\u201d in my mess with me. Unable to be communicated with currently. \n\nIt\u2019s been almost 2 months and I somehow feel worse than I did the week of her death. \n\nI have a lot of regrets about our relationship. I know I am only human, but she deserved more in life than what she got and I should\u2019ve given more. I was pretty selfish in my youth. We were just starting to mend our relationship when she died. I brought her a Mother\u2019s Day gift just a week before. \n\nI hate knowing that after all of her life, she went back to the nothingness that we were in before we were born. \n\nI don\u2019t want to die because I think I\u2019ll be reunited with her. I want to die because I won\u2019t be without her anymore.\n\nI\u2019m 4 days shy of not having SH\u2019d for 1400 days. I am struggling tonight. Alternatively, I want to drive away from the city and turn off my phone for a day. Stop being a mourning daughter, an invisible girlfriend, a tired pet parent of ill animals, a lawyer\u2019s client, an executor, etc. Not have a check list of things to do for her house, or my job, that no one can help me with.\n\nI truly believe I\u2019ll take myself out one day. Maybe I\u2019ll give myself the same amount of time as she had. Sometimes, I just don\u2019t see how I can make it that long, though. I don\u2019t know how I can love the same things I loved before she passed. What did I even love? I foolishly gave a lot of my heart to others. That\u2019s about it. \n\nI don\u2019t have the energy. \n\nI don\u2019t want advice or solutions.
