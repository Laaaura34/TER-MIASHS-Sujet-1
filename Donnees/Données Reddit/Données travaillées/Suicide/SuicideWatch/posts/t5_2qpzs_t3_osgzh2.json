I was raised in a Christian household, I was raised with proper, well adjusted parents. No trauma, no abuse, no abandonment or lack. Up until high school I always had at least one best friend, literally I always had one person who would agree with me that I was their best friend. We\u2019d play tag a recess or just walk around the playground and talk about random shit. I went to church every Sunday, went to the beach with family, got along great with my siblings, parents had no favorites and treated us all equally, I had a cat I adored though admittedly sometimes terrorized it, I had (have technically, still living in the same home) a huge backyard that I played in almost every day with my siblings, we had (again have technically) amazing neighborhood friends. I would wake up every day with legitimate joy and wonder, I was excited, even for school. \n\nI had the kind of childhood that probably makes most people on this sub seethe with envy. Those people would read my post with incredulity, how in the living fuck is this guy? Why does he belong here?? He couldn\u2019t possibly understand what we\u2019ve been through\u2026and I agree. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what the fuck is wrong with me, yet somehow I\u2019m emotionally and psychologically stunted, I isolate myself from family, I lash out at others for the smallest things, I victimize myself quite a bit, I just have a genuine disdain for this life. \n\nI feel like I have so much to say and yet my brain is so foggy. Of course when I want to say something my brain locks up, but if I want to sleep and relax, suddenly World War III has erupted in my head. Not that anyone would pay attention anyway, I understand that I\u2019m just another faceless person on this sub, whining about the same shit over and over and over again, just like everybody else. \n\nI was never popular, never had much attention given to me outside of family (yeah I know I sound pretty spoiled, many people on this sub couldn\u2019t even get attention from their family). I guess my problem is that I\u2019m just so\u2026terribly average and normal in all kinds of ways, and very much not average in all the wrong ways, in very disgusting ways, if that makes any sense. \n\nI have all this disgusting and inhuman traits, and nothing good. I have nothing to offer, I just shouldn\u2019t fucking be here. Why did the universe allow me to be conceptualized? Why did my biological parents, whoever they are (adopted), have to create me?? \n\nAll I ever wanted to do was be a super empathetic, compassionate, loving, safe, kind, accepting, giving, and joyful person. I am none of those. I\u2019m quickly losing my ability to empathize with others because I hurt too much, I can\u2019t extend compassionate or love because reality is too cold and harsh, I don\u2019t feel safe with myself\u2026how long until that happens with other people as well? I\u2019m not very kind, I\u2019m super grumpy and angry at life and everyone in it, I\u2019m becoming very unaccepting of others because I feel like the universe or god has rejected me, I am not joyful, that\u2019s just a big no, I cringe at happy and uppity people. The only silver lining here is that I\u2019m sort of giving, only because I hate myself so much that I want to serve others (albeit in small ways) and forget I exist, I want to be put last. At the same time though I hate that I\u2019m feeling so left out\u2026so I want to be heard and acknowledged, but I can\u2019t get any acknowledgment or attention from who it matters most..\n\nI\u2019m a horrible person with sickening thoughts anyway, why should I get any sort of acknowledgment. I shouldn\u2019t get to have friends, to have a girlfriend (haven\u2019t had one ever lol), to have a family that cares about me, to have hopes or dreams, I am nothing, I am no one important or special. I am just a dirty rag, I\u2019m the one cracked egg, the defective product, I have no purpose or use other than to be thrown away and discarded. I am understanding this and accepting this more and more\u2026\n\nHonestly I barely care at this point whether people care anymore. I don\u2019t care\u2026that\u2019s all that matters. \n\nI\u2019m trying to think of other things to say, but that\u2019s probably a sign that I should stop. I\u2019ve said all I can say, I\u2019ve said many things multiple times over. I am not unique, I am not special, I am not someone anyone wants to be friends with or someone to look up to, I have no special qualities, no good looks, no intelligence, no wit or ability to make others laugh, I don\u2019t make anyone feel special or noticed or important, I don\u2019t make anyone excited when I walk in the room, if anything I suck the life out of the room, everyone watches me from their peripheral view, analyzing me to see what I want or what I\u2019m going to do, eager to see me leave. \n\nI just\u2026don\u2019t get it. I serve zero purpose and have no function. When people on this sub or anywhere else try and give me to stay, what is the fucking reason? Couldn\u2019t be because I will help humanity, couldn\u2019t be because I have some special to offer, couldn\u2019t be because I look good, or give people the giggles, or befriend others easily, or make people feel at ease and calm, important, heard, it couldn\u2019t be because of anything good is my damn point. \n\nWhat do you want me to just sit in the corner and merely exist for the sake of my family? What kind of fucking life is that? Clearly no one in this world needs me, so you can\u2019t possibly imply that there\u2019s some greater goal for me to achieve, or people to meet, or grand adventure to go on. I can\u2019t do fucking anything that this world needs me to do, I can\u2019t be anything this worlds need me to be, so just let me fucking go. \n\nUnfortunately society will not help me in this endeavor, so I must undergo this task alone, via hanging of the self. It should be fun. I don\u2019t care about the pain or slow agony of suffocating anymore, if anything I look forward to it in a sick way. I know I don\u2019t matter and don\u2019t have any worth or use, so it\u2019s for the best. I\u2019m a creepy weirdo anyway, so I\u2019m just imagining all the faces of the people who will feel at ease knowing there\u2019s one less potentially dangerous person in the world, and I\u2019ll be happy knowing I won\u2019t live long enough to be one of them. \n\nSo thanks for everything I guess, reddit has been a huge life saver\u2026until it isn\u2019t I guess lmao. But seriously you guys helped me get through a lot of shitty moments, helped me fall under the illusion that I wasn\u2019t alone and I actually had a \u201ctribe,\u201d like I had found \u201cmy people\u201d. I know \u201cmy people\u201d don\u2019t exist, or if they do they\u2019re incredibly fucked up and nasty, and I don\u2019t want any empathy or compassion from them, I don\u2019t want to be related to them in any way shape or form. So I\u2019ll choose to kill myself instead. \n\nI literally cannot wait. For those of you who are leaving with me, see you on the other side (if there actually is one). Hopefully it\u2019s a much better place than this, and we can ride on the cloud tops laughing at all the suckers stuck down here thinking it\u2019s worthwhile.
