Most of my dreams are weird, because some antihistamines and antidepressants can cause you to see weird dreams, and I\u2019m on mirtazapine, so that\u2019s probably why.\n\nAnyways its not really a single dream, more like the end of whatever dream I was seeing. I notice that I am in a dream, which happens very often actually. Then I get this feeling, like whatever binds my soul to my body is gone and my soul can leave my body. I feel happy and content, and I try to leave my body, I don\u2019t feel afraid. Just as I feel like I\u2019m being released from my body, I wake up, I notice that it was just a dream, and I feel disappointed.\n\nI\u2019ve never attempted suicide, I don\u2019t think I will. Although I came close a couple years ago. But these days things are becoming more and more hopeless for me. On top of that I am in physical pain some of the days because of IBS. Which is nothing compared to a serious disease. But where I am right now, I can\u2019t hope for anything other than death.\n\nI can play video games sometimes though, so I guess I haven\u2019t given up yet.\n\nI am not in a lot of pain, I want to say that again. I can\u2019t handle it. I must be strong. But I am not strong. I am just not strong, that is just not who I am. Please don\u2019t tell me I am strong, IBS is like not a serious disease. Most people can handle it just fine. My life has ended because of it, because I am not strong, I can\u2019t push back.\n\nAnxiety attacks started again. God there is just so much darkness. It is drowning.\n\nI may not be able to reply if you reach out. I am going through an IBS flare up so I have to stay in the bathroom most of the times.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oy6voe/not_at_risk_there_is_an_immense_amount_of_darkness/", "title": "(Not at risk) There is an immense amount of darkness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nitratehoarder", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628125802, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oy6voe/not_at_risk_there_is_an_immense_amount_of_darkness/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635427903.886674, "replies_charged": false}
