That broke me out of my regular schedule and gave me time to think.\nI'm thinking about quitting engineering.. Or just quitting life.\nAnd it's not because I can't do it... I know I'm capable enough of not only getting my degree, but also getting at least a decent score...\nIt's just that I don't know what I am doing anymore... This thought has been gnawing at my head ever since my submissions last semester.\nI honestly feel lost.. for the lack of a better word. \nAnd now after my internal semster exams I feel even more lost... I don't even seem to understand the subjects that I actually enjoy and want to learn. My lifelong dream was to be an automobile engineer. To design and build cars. And given that, I slugged and worked my ass off to get where I am today. But now I don't feel like I'm learning anything.  \nFor most of my life I've had a crystal clear goal. No matter what I was doing, I knew what I wanted. Whether it be good grades, learning a new skill or just maybe buying something I want... I've never known not being on a path. I don't know what to do anymore. Even if I drop out, I don't know what I'd do afterwards. \n\nAnd the stress sometimes gets to me.I've been getting it in waves.. in the middle of class, I'd think about something and it starts without warning. Hands get shaky and it's hard to breathe, all the while I'm holding back the urge to cry.\nI don't want to admit it, but I've been thinking about suicide for a little longer than a year now. This might sound clich\u00e9 but the easy way out looks just out of reach every time I think about this. \nI don't know who to talk to about this... I don't know if anyone can actually understand, because I know I can't really explain what I'm feeling.\n\nIf you're still reading, I apologize for my negativity. I just wanted someone to vent to.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9bjwt4/lost/", "title": "Lost", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "_dog_person_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1535637967, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9bjwt4/lost/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426302.4904451, "replies_charged": false}
