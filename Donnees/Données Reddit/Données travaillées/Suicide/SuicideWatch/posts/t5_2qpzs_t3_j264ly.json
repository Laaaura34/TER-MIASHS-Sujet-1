If the quality of your life can be assessed through your social bonds, your successes, and how you feel, isn\u2019t my existence objectively worth ending? In my 30s, been like this since I was nine, and as an adult I\u2019ve learned to hide myself when I\u2019m feeling bad because I tend to make irrational decisions. No one ever notices I\u2019m gone, and then when I do reconnect with people or make new connections I end up terrifying them or being a nightmare friend. My roommate of a year and a half is getting short notice that I\u2019m moving out and he seemed relieved when I told him, I made friends with this girl online I ended up growing a fixation over which terrified her to the point of blocking me on all social media platforms, and when I asked my parents if I could move back in with them their first response was \u201care you going to take advantage of us?\u201d Literally nobody on any level of social relations wants me around. My parents own a lot of guns. They can\u2019t keep all their closets and safes locked ALL the time. I tried to confide in a coworker today about my problems and it freaked him out and now I\u2019m embarrassed to talk to him.
