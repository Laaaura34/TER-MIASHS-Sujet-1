I\u2019m tired of living, but afraid of dying, I know its really common but my anxiety/panic attacks and depression make it worse every day...  Background story, since I was a teenager my grandma and mom traumatized me and my other sisters about being overweight and how important was to stay tiny and skinny... long story short I developed bulimia and anorexia and with that depression and anxiety, instead of helping me my mother and grandma blamed it on me and how I was trying to seek for attention. I love my mother and grandma but they still think they didn\u2019t do anything wrong and I don\u2019t expect any apologies from them... With those problems (bulimia, anorexia, depression and anxiety), a big amount of insecurity came to my life, I started to date and I was so insecure but never jealous, but I always got cheated on, after some other bad experiences my jealousy developed pretty quick and in some recent relationships it showed off a lot. Im in the army, active duty and mind my first month I got sexually assaulted and no one cared, I was too afraid to say something. And in my last relationship I got cheated on various times by my ex fianc\u00e9 while I was deployed in Afghanistan, that completely broke me mentally and physically, I came back with a lot of problems, went to behavioral health and got diagnosed with ptsd, severe depression and anxiety. In current events I\u2019m married, and I have a beautiful daughter I love with all my heart... but things are still going down; my pregnancy was horrible and my husband (we are dual mil) wasn\u2019t able to be here he was on rotation, during my pregnancy I tried talking to him but he always ignored me, my messages, calls everything... he spent money going out, drinking, eating out and paying juicy girls to play pool with him... I was a complete burden to him. I never planned on getting pregnant while serving I was on birth control and it failed but decided to keep it going because he asked for it... when I had my baby (literally giving birth) he wasn\u2019t answering his phone calls and when he finally did he was eating out with his friends and got mad at me... He came back for 3-4 days and everything seemed pretty good I had hope. But when he finally came back (my baby was 3 months) he never wanted to take care of the baby, or do things to help me. I had to spend time trying to pump, clean, feed the baby, and get things ready to go back to work... I gained a lot of weight, from 137 to 180 and after pregnancy my metabolism went down and with that my confidence and will to keep going, I got diagnosed with post partum depression and I didn\u2019t want to do anything, I just lived and live for my daughter. Now, my marriage, life and career is more garbage, my husband and I just fight constantly, I get reminded how fat I got every day at work, my husband doesn\u2019t like me sexually and gets disgusted by me, he spends time masturbating to other girls on his phone and caught him talking to his exes before... I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t explain myself but all of this and more are killing me inside, I hate myself more everyday and since a long time everything has been getting worse, I wanna die so bad but Im afraid of whats gonna happen, I love my daughter, my husband and my family but I can\u2019t anymore... This hole is keeping me in a state of mind where I can\u2019t think straight, Im always over depressed, anxious. I want my husband to be with someone prettier, and sexy, I want my daughter to have a healthy mom that can giver her everything, I want my family and my mom to be proud of me and I can\u2019t, Ic can\u2019t be like that anymore, I\u2019m more like a burden every day... There\u2019s always more to the story but this is all I am able to write... I need help but not even therapies, meds or the suicide/vet line can help me... I just wanna be courageous enough to kill myself and end all this pain.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i6n1yd/my_life_is_going_down_every_day/", "title": "My life is going down every day...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AngelEsp98", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596993493, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i6n1yd/my_life_is_going_down_every_day/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422944.099226, "replies_charged": false}
