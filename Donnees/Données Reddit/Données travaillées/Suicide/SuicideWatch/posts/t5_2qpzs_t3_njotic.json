I started out in hell. Being told I was a mistake. Kicked in the face while choking on a chip at 2 by my mother. Being pummeled in the body and face by my father till I shit blood and blood was coming from every orifice on my head at 4. Being made to eat my own vomit by my stepmother. Having cigarettes put out on my body at 3 by moms new boyfriend. Having to sacrifice myself at 3 to the same man to keep my sister safe from his demented sexual escapades. There's so much more just in the first 5 years of my life. I got the help for it but it was a long LONG uphill battle that thankfully my new parents, who adopted me, stood by me for. Then as I thought I may now have a normal life, minus the childhood, it came crashing down again.\n\nI was to be a father. Only the mother has now done successfully swindled every person and state system to bar me from my son's life. She tried having me labeled a woman beater and a child molester. None of which I am, as I had vowed if I ever turned into one of those people that I was first introduced to when I began my life, I would light myself on fire and throw myself in front of a train. Since I'm here typing this it should be obvious of the person I am. I provided the court with so much evidence that went against her accusations, that her own lawyer abandoned her in the middle of the court room. Yet the courts still thought it necessary to keep me from my son. I got to hold my son once for 15 minutes several hours after he was born. I got to see him again a little less than 2 years ago for about 2 hours because I begged and pleaded. He is now 10. I am only known to him as mommy's old friend.\n\nI now have something wrong with me that keeps me from living a normal life. I don't know what is wrong with me because despite my persistence, my doctors keep dicking me around. Oh its heartburn they say. No its not I tell them. Heartburn doesn't sap the strength from me to the point I collapse to the ground whenever I have an episode.(BTW I'm a tall and broad man with a bit of a belly. I am strong. I sling 100lb brake drums at the shop like it's nothing. So for me to be brought to the ground is no easy task.) Its something going on with my heart and lungs I keep telling them. Nobody seems to listen. I can't go to work anymore because I can't do anything physical without having another episode. Sometimes I have episodes when I'm just sitting.\n\nAll while this new health issue is plaguing me, the woman, who knew I was going to ask her for her hand in marriage, suddenly tells me she hopes I die and leaves. Out of nowhere. I have no friends. Nobody except my parents and my little brother who is only 16. I can't bother them with this. My father's health sucks and my mother's is even worse.\n\nI used to be the most headstrong person I knew. The one who could always stand and fight no matter what but as of lately, that man is dead. The idea of dieing no longer bothers me. I pray one of my episodes takes me in my sleep every night. If not that I hope the doctors eventually tell me it's something terminal. Hell I tried not too long ago. Same result. I'm still here but not of my choosing.\n\nHonestly it needs to end. This isn't a life. It's merely surviving hell.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/njotic/so_its_come_to_this/", "title": "So it's come to this....", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Deep-Education1167", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621828045, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/njotic/so_its_come_to_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428248.5212793, "replies_charged": false}
