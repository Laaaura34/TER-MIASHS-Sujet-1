I don't know what to do or where to turn. This week has been rough. I lost the only job in the last 10 years I cared about because they changed my schedule an hour after I got off for my day off switching my day off for the next day. I get in on what was supposed to be my scheduled day to see no call no show emails along with the schedule change one.\n\nWell it turns out that since I have the option to view my schedule off of the intranet that it is my fault even though they post these \"shifting\" schedules a month in advance so you can plan for them. I got fired.\n\nThat leads into a couple of days of wallowing in the crap, and after working at it for a few days my room mate decides we should drink and commiserate. The next morning the glasses I got about 2 weeks before went missing (second set to do so). I found them out in the yard where his dogs keep their toys. Now I'm stumbling around damn near blind and he recommends I bend the arm back and try to buff out the gouges or see past them.\n\nFuck I just kicked a bad drinking habbit, was working hard to advance where I was, and now I can't even see. I've got $60 to my name and I have no clue where to go. The only thing I know is that walking in front of the light rail keeps popping into my head 20-30x a day.
