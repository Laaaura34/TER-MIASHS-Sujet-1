Really thought I would make it to at least adult hood but here I am ready to kill myself and soon I will kill myself. I've already got a plan I just need a date, was thinking of something soon so I don't have to wait too long because the longer you wait the more chance that you back out. Life is hell, this place is hell I'd rather just simply not be alive. Hopefully I get hit by a car or die in my sleep before I have to do it myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pa5bc6/dead_at_15/", "title": "Dead at 15", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Responsible_Elk_3845", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629741898, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pa5bc6/dead_at_15/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425479.5310056, "replies_charged": false}
