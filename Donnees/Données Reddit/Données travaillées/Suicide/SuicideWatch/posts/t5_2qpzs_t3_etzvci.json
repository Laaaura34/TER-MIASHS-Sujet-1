I'm 25 and have no marketable skills, no friends, i'm a complete failure. I almost decided to just end everything on multiple occasions, but actually came really close to just doing it recently. Then I realized something, if I'm going to just end it anyways I may as well give life a real shot with no inhibitions. I'm giving myself 6 months, I'm going to try to get a job in the sales industry, to become more positive and social, to study in my off time in case I can get back into school next year. The fact that I have the option to just end everything has given me more confidence, I no longer care about how people look at me etc. Ironically the option of suicide has made it easier for me to give life my all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/etzvci/having_suicide_as_an_option_has_given_me_peace_of/", "title": "Having suicide as an option has given me peace of mind.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway948104875", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 29, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1580001414, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/etzvci/having_suicide_as_an_option_has_given_me_peace_of/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426418.9383287, "replies_charged": false}
