I don't think I ever really want to die, but I definitely don't want to keep on living if life is this.\n\nI guess I should start by saying that I am privileged, I have access to free healthcare with no limitations on mental health, I have a therapist that I click with and is wonderful, I have a job that I care about and a mother that loves me. And still I can't find any desire to carry on.\n\nI was a medic in the Army, and I was and still really am not ready to deal with the reality of it. I made mistakes and I can't shake off the what ifs, should haves and could haves. I always remember that I made mistakes, I called things good enough, I didn't speak up for the casualty when I could and should have, and it led to the picture in my mind that I always come back to, telling our Air Force JTAC officer that I was sorry and there was nothing left I could do. Worst of all, it was just the congruence of so many small things that added together to create the situation, so that the situation crept up on me and I wasn't aware where everything was heading until it was too late. It's really the guilt and fear that gets to me.\n\nI'm afraid of myself, my actions and my mistakes, especially the potential of causing unforeseeable, unpreventable catastrophic harm. I don't trust myself to do the right thing, or to do the good thing, so I try to put myself in a place where I will never have to do anything. I'm so scared that I will harm or allow harm to come to people around me, so I have withdrawn, and slowly tried to fade out of everyone's lives. This way I can't hurt them now and it won't hurt them as much when I finally do go through with it. But this also scares me, because the idea that no one outside of my family and maybe 2 friends would really care if I killed myself is terrifying.\n\nI am cognizant enough to know that killing myself is a selfish thing, something that will cause harm, instead of good for the people around me. I know it will be unfair to my family, my friends, my therapist, my coworkers, but that voice that says I'm a fundamentally bad, unlovable, broken, burden can feel so definitive. I've told myself that since I'm an organ donor, it would be better because I will be doing something positive to offset partially the negative, but I don't know if I fully buy into it yet.\n\nIt's been over 9 years now that I've felt like this, I've run through the rest of my 20s and it has maybe only gotten worse, or at least it definitely hasn't gotten better. I'm now 32 and I'm so fucking lonely. \n\nIn that time, I've tried to kill myself, gone through a 4 month PTSD recovery program, had a loving relationship destroyed by my idiocy and baggage and then tried to kill myself again. I just got out of the inpatient wing of a VA hospital a couple weeks ago, after I checked myself in from fear of what I would do to myself and now, 2 weeks later, I am on the edge again. I don't want to die, I find that I'm still scared of doing the deed when it gets close, the harm and pain it would cause some people, but I don't want to live anymore without the prospect of getting better and I am so, so tired of being alive, in pain and unable to connect with other people. \n\nI don't see a future where things get better, and I don't see a future where I can keep going indefinitely which is fucked because I know how good I have it compared to so many people. I have unlimited medical benefits, and the Veterans Administration has been good to me. I believe in my work, and I have a great job here at the VA Medical Center, helping other veterans. The idea that I do something meaningful or bring positive things in other people's lives keeps me going, but then the darkest ruminations come in, where I can see how I harm people, cause pain and burden in a shitty, destructive way. When that belief in myself is gone, then the resentment comes, the anger and frustration of how my suicide would hurt loved ones, holding me back. It's the frustration at the idea of being trapped, feeling forced to live for them instead of doing what I really want.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you and I'm sorry for even posting this, for creating something that will invariably cause and spread pain to other people. I know I shouldn't just share the pain, because misery loves company, but I'm also just so scared and lonely and afraid that I will die without anyone ever knowing or understanding.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/opwptu/i_guess_i_just_want_this_off_my_chest/", "title": "I guess I just want this off my chest", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "roughdecade", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627022380, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/opwptu/i_guess_i_just_want_this_off_my_chest/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428020.031906, "replies_charged": false}
