Things have gotten worse, and worse; I am stuck and do not know what to do... I want to just die. \n\nI don't know if there is a god. But if there isn't I don't care what happens when I die. At least I won't have to answer for the crimes against myself. But then, I wouldn't be able to see or watch over the people I love, even if they do hate me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll I feel is sadness.
