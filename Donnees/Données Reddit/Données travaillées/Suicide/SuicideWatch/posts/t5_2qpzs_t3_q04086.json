I hope you feel good about it. I hope pushing a man to kill himself sits well with your soul. I'm no angel, but you aren't either. I was wrong, to ever contact you. But you are answering wrong with wrong. You're not any better than me. At least all I wanted was love. You want blood. \n\nTo everyone else, I'm sorry. I'm a failure. I failed my family, my friends, and myself. I failed to be a man, and I failed to be a decent human. I failed to respect boundaries. I learned my lessons too late, and now the bill is due. I'm full of regret and pain. Let me go. It has nothing to do with any of you. I just need to go. I'm a cancer to anyone that knows me. \n\nAnd lastly, to my family, I promise, I loved you. I always did, and still do. I just can't live with the pain anymore.
