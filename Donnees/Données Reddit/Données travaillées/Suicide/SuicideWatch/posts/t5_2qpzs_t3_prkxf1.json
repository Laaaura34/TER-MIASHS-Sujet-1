I dont care if im not even 15 im tired of everything, i dont want to wait like 4-6 years to move out and be alone life just doesn't seem worth it at all. Ive been thinking about killing myself more and more the past few months and it really seems like the only option but at the same time i dont want to die. I want to wait for someone to save me cause god knows i cant do shit for myself even if i want to, but the chance that no one will come is really fucking scary and i dont know if i want to risk feeling bad more just for a slim chance at being alright.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/prkxf1/last_post_got_ignored_so_ill_try_again_ig/", "title": "Last post got ignored so ill try again ig", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "xxLolmat_13xx", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632101490, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/prkxf1/last_post_got_ignored_so_ill_try_again_ig/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427957.2304952, "replies_charged": false}
