I am not thinking of killing myself anymore but I have been suicidal in the past, really I am looking for anyone who will take the time and listen . I'm really trying hard to improve myself and if this speaks to anyone out there I hope you know your not alone even if it seems like all of society is telling you your a worthless piece of shit.\n\n  Ok so where to begin,  I am what society calls an incel,  I typically don't refer to myself as that because of the negative associations with that term and also because I'm so much more than that , but that is the problem I'm facing. It really goes back to my narcissistic mother , my first memories of her are her always fighting with my biological father and then coming to me for comfort. Naturally I didn't understand what was going on but I wanted to make my mom feel better , but as I've grown older I've come to understand that she is a massive instigator who starts shit and then plays the victim because she gets a rush from getting sympathy attention. \n  \n   When I was 4 years old she took me one day and we got on a greyhound bus and moved across the country and never went back. She soon met my stepfather who is an alcoholic pushover who was never successful with women and was easy for my mom to manipulate. When I was growing up we were homeless 3 separate times and moved frequently across the country and my mother would fill the families heads with her paranoid rantings about how the state was coming to take her kids away. A month into 3rd grade I was pulled out of school and \" homeschooled \" for the rest of my childhood.  I say homeschooled in quotation marks because as the oldest of 6 kids she never really had time for me and especially after 6th grade I was on my own , reading encyclopedias cover to cover,  going to the adult book section and the internet.  I should say here that I am extremely intelligent,  not as a brag but as a fact , like genius levels of intelligence especially in history and social sciences,  but this has not helped me with my own problems. But the real reason for homeschooling was to isolate and keep absolute and total control over her children. \n\n  My childhood was very much controlled in every aspect by my mother. My stepfather was always too busy and his parenting skills were awkward at best and downright disastrous most of the time. I got the \"talk \" at 21 ( about 14 years too late) and the best he could muster was some bullshit about \" oh well you know some things fit into other things and it's kinda like that with men and women \" . In addition every day was like navigating a mine field because any little thing that put my mom in a bad mood would set her off on an abusive rage tantrum that could last for hours and could include everything from emotional abuse to beatings, followed by her withholding love for days or even weeks until you begged for forgiveness. My biological father wasn't in the picture at all because as my mom put it \" oh I'm so sorry I must have lost his address and number in the move , I didn't think it would be so important to you.\" That turned out to be bullshit  but more on that in a minute. \n\n  When I was 12 I finally convinced them to allow me to do boy scouts and I made a few really good friends including a guy who is still my best friend today and later I even managed to get them to allow me to do track and cross country with the local high school,  however I was never fully able to enjoy these activities as much as I would have liked because my mother was an expert at using the things I enjoyed as a way to keep a tight grip of control over my life with the prospect of taking everything away if I set one foot out of line . In addition she always had a way of sneaking around and figuring out if I was ever talking to a girl ( if I ever fell in love with someone else that was a threat to her control) and she would pop out of nowhere and do something really humiliating in public ( ridiculing , name calling , bringing up embarrassing things ) and then later saying \" what I'm just being a fun mom\" , this destroyed my chances with women in my teen years and destroyed my confidence with women for a long time after that.\n\n  When I was 18 years old I finally had enough , and I did the most rebellious thing I could think of to defy her ... I joined the U.S. Army,  and because she had made me feel so inadequate for so long I joined the infantry because it was the most manly thing I could think of and because I knew she would hate it and there was nothing she could do to stop me. Basic training was hard because I had been so sheltered before but I made it through without incident and at graduation my biological father showed up , this was the first time I had seen him since I was 4 years old and we met up a few more times but I  really had a hard time connecting. But I really wish I did because we seemed to have similar interests ( history was a passion for both of us ) . The last time I saw him he told me that he had tried to contact me but my mother wouldn't let him talk to me , and I didn't believe him. I really regret this now because I very recently found out this was actually true but it was too late , he took his own life a few months after that conversation and I still blame myself for that too this day.\n\n  Army life was terrible at first , I was a very socially awkward kid who didn't fit in and my platoon Sergeant told all of the NCOs to make my life hell and force me to quit or go to mental health but I was stubborn and refused to give up and quit and I was always able to perform my tasks even if I had a harder time with it at first , but this was a very dark and lonely time for me with few real friends and it was the first time I contemplated suicide. After 9 months of this hell the few NCOs I had who were worth a damn took notice and started talking me up and I was eventually transferred to a different platoon who made me feel for the first time ever like I was part of a family and was valued for my intelligence even tho I was awkward. 2 months later I deployed to Afghanistan with that platoon. To make a long story short being at war was the best part of that year even though I went through some terrible days including watching one of the only NCOs who stuck up for me in my first platoon get blown to pieces right in front of me. In addition to that my biological father committed suicide at that time and to top it all off I came home at Christmas and my family had lost the house where we had finally settled as a kid and were staying in the basement of the rich family at church who's son always used to flaunt his wealth and generally be a dick to me . To make matters worse he was dating the girl I really liked at the time. \n\n  And so back to the army I went , I reenlisted and worked my way up the ranks to Sergeant and got out after nearly 7 years and moved to LA. this is where I had my second real battle with life , I lost my purpose and my support group when I got out and found myself sliding deeper and deeper into depression and soon I was living in a hotel room stoned out of my mind for weeks trying not to feel anything and by Christmas time I was sitting ot the railroad tracks waiting for a train to come and end it but something told me to keep going. A month later I was living on the streets,  but being homeless again provided the shock to the system that I needed and I finally went to the VA for help and they sent me to a homeless shelter for veterans on Skid Row.  I got a job and I started working out and taking care of myself and I soon met a girl at work who for a time was very close with me and seemed to like me and built up my confidence .\n\n  And then COVID-19 hit and the lockdown happened and I was unable to get out of the homeless shelter in time and she skipped off with a Beverly Hills millionaire and I was left feeling totally worthless. Now down on my luck with nothing to my name and feeling about as low as I ever have felt I was forced to move back home with my parents... just in time for my mom to split with my 2 youngest siblings because \" I haven't been intimate with Dad in 2 years\" . And never called us again. \n\n  This is where I'm at now physically,  with my step-dad,  but mentally , emotionally, and  spirituality I am a world away from the broken looser I used to be . True enough I am still unsuccessful in the dating realm but I have discovered stoicism and rediscovered Christianity,  I've started listening to Jordan Peterson and I've begun to find purpose in my life ,I've been helping my teenage sister deal with the fact that she got abandoned by our mother and I'm closer with my other siblings then I ever was , I have a job and I'm working on a new plan for my life . \n\n  But most of all I've discovered something new , and that is that I actually kind of like myself,  I read about history when I was young and was fascinated by it and then I went and made a damn good story of my own.  I defied a terrible mother and a fucked up childhood and followed in the footsteps of my heroes,  I walked in the footsteps of Alexander the Great and camped on Napolions battlefields,  ive skydived the grand canyon with my best friend and took a greyhound to Hollywood to pursue a dream,  I've fallen in love and even tho it didn't work out I learned that I could do that and that women didn't all think I was completely worthless,  I've made good friends along the way by opening up and being myself with ever more confidence,  I can and have talked on an equal footing with celebrities and homeless vets,  politicians and coworkers,  I've made a life despite terrible circumstances and I'm just getting started.  And above all I have learned that all of my experiences have given me the insight to help people,  even if I didn't know I was at the time. \n\n  My message to any incel reading this is don't give in to hate ,rage, or dispare ... the world is fucked right now and we all have bigger fish to fry so work on yourself and start trying too put your own life in order. Don't listen to what the bitter , angry, little narcissistic assholes who write up negative articles or belittle us on the internet or even irl say about us,  we are so much more than neckbeard having , moms basement dwelling , doreto eating loosers and if us incels can start to make a real positive change first in our own lives , then in our community and then i the world , if we can stop giving in to the depression and find our purpose and make it our mission to prove every single one of those smug arrogant pompous holier-than-thou asswipes not only to be wrong about us but also to be the absolute ignorant,  narcissistic,  need to feel like they are better than everyone else asshats they are then we will be better people for it and we will triumph in the end .\n\n  To those who are quick to judge the men who can't find relationships I say this,  we are not monsters,  we are not all mass shooters or domestic terrorists and franklythe way the media , academia, Hollywood and the mainstream establishment treats us is akin to saying all  Muslims are terrorists. We do not feel entitled to a relationship nor for the most part are we even mysoginsts, we just want what everyone else wants,  to feel loved . And the fact that the forms  online are so filled with that talk is discouraging to many many young men struggling to find their way who don't feel that way but are to intimidated to speak up and reach out because of the pure ridicule and derision that they know they ar gonna face if they do. For the most part we are young men who had the terrible fortune of being born to shit parents, who never taught us how to navigate the world  each for their own terrible reasons. We don't get to choose our families. So next time you feel inclined to sneer and look down at us with contempt just remember \" there but for the grace of God go I \".\n\n  My message to those going through depression and PTSD weather from war or abuse is don't give up , it never will be easy but you have a purpose in life , you have  talents and unique experiences that shape you , but you also have the responsibility to figure out what those talents are and how best to bring them into this world.  We are going through a terrible time in history right now but if we all focus on bringing our best selves to the table then we might not be able to avoid the tragedy of life but maybe just maybe we can pull our world back from the brink of hell and that would be a heroic accomplishment for the ages indeed.  \n\n  That's my story , I hope you can take something positive from it , and if reaching someone who needed to hear it for whatever reason and they take inspiration and find something that they needed and it helps to improve their life , then maybe the pain was worth it after all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/olcm3t/im_what_society_calls_an_incel_and_im_tired_of/", "title": "I'm what society calls an incel and I'm tired of being a looser.
