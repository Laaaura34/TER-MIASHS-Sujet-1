Why can't we though? I read a lot of posts here of people having no talent and little to no worth and I know the feeling and I'm not upset at the thought at all. I know I'm worth nothing so I wish I could sacrifice my life and give my years to someone else who actually deserves it. \n\nI don't want to kill myself but I think I will. I don't know when yet but I hope my indecisive self can decide soon.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hp0rq7/a_life_for_a_life/", "title": "A life, for a life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dlkjsn_9300", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 49, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594428171, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hp0rq7/a_life_for_a_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426647.4605434, "replies_charged": false}
