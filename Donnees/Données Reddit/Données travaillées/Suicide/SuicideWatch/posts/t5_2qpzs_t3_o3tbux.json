These so-called chemosignals \u2013 which are in fact odourless \u2013 are believed to trigger happiness or fear in others. It is one of the ways smell impacts people\u2019s social interactions.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like an emotional contagion. If I feel fear, my body odour will be smelt by people around me and they may start to feel fear themselves, unconsciously,\u2019 said Enzo Pasquale Scilingo, a professor at the Department of Information Engineering at the University of Pisa, Italy.\n\nSimilarly, the smell of happiness can inspire a positive state in other people, says Prof. Scilingo.\n\n\u2018If we had a spray of happiness \u2026 If we can find some odour which can induce a happy state \u2013 or a general positive state \u2013 I think we can help many, many people,\u2019 Prof. Scilingo said.\n\nHe hopes scientists can produce one within a few years. This could be particularly important in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, with cases of depression rising especially among young people.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to say having this spray will (cure) people, but I think it\u2019s a very beautiful contribution,\u2019 Prof. Scilingo said.\n\nSweat\n\nHe is coordinating a project called POTION which is researching these chemosignals. The researchers use videos to induce fear or happiness in people, and then collect their sweat to analyse which chemical compounds are released with each emotion.\n\n\u2018The next step is to synthesise the odours and \u2026 investigate how they induce emotions in others,\u2019 said Prof. Scilingo.\n\nEventually, fear odours and people\u2019s responses to them could be used to help psychiatrists understand more about different aspects of phobias and depression. And happiness odours could be used to help in treatment.\n\n\u2018If we can use the odour of happiness in addition to the usual treatment for phobias or depression, we (could) increase the efficacy of the therapy,\u2019 said Prof. Scilingo. \n\nThe POTION researchers are also investigating how odours impact people\u2019s social interactions, and sense of inclusion or exclusion from others.\n\nPrevious research has found that a person\u2019s emotional state can influence how they respond to other people \u2013 and how others respond to them, Prof. Scilingo says. Someone feeling fear is less likely to approach or trust people, and others are likely to be wary of them. And the reverse is true for happiness \u2013 the happier someone is, the more likely they are both to trust others and to attract them, says Prof. Scilingo.\n\nMammals\n\nIn mammals, the sense of smell is uniquely linked to the part of the brain associated with emotions and the creation of memories, says Dr Lisa Roux, researcher at the Interdisciplinary Institute for Neuroscience in France.\n\nSmell is important for recognition between people. A mother can recognise the smell of her child, for example, and this may be an important part of bonding, she said.\n\n\u2018We humans use our sense of smell more than we think. It\u2019s more unconscious, and a little bit taboo \u2013 we are not very comfortable with it \u2013 but there is more and more evidence that smell is important in social behaviours,\u2019 said Dr Roux.\n\nThe first region of the brain that processes chemosignals \u2013 the olfactory bulb \u2013 is directly connected to the limbic system, which controls the ability to identify another individual, the formation of memories, and manages emotional responses.\n\nAll other senses \u2013 taste, hearing, sight and touch \u2013 are processed by other regions of the brain before being linked to the limbic system.\n\nThis may be because smell has been the most important sense for the survival of species. \u2018Chemical signalling is very important, even for bacteria. It\u2019s a very ancient modality, it\u2019s really key,\u2019 Dr Roux said.\n\n\n\u2018We humans use our sense of smell more than we think. It\u2019s more unconscious, and a little bit taboo \u2013 we are not very comfortable with it \u2013 but there is more and more evidence that smell is important in social behaviours.\u2019\n\nDr Lisa Roux, Interdisciplinary Institute for Neuroscience, France\n\nPleasure and pain\n\nThe sense of smell is linked to pleasure and depression, possibly because of its unique link to the limbic system.\n\nUp to a third of people with a defective sense of smell experience symptoms of depression, according to a research paper published in 2014.\n\nThis may be partly because of their loss of sense of taste, and concerns about personal hygiene and social interactions. But it is also likely that olfactory loss affects the brain\u2019s functioning and in particular its emotional control, authors of the paper said.\n\n\u2018This might be because the olfactory system is directly linked to the limbic regions \u2013 which include the amygdala that is very important for controlling emotions,\u2019 said Dr Roux.\n\nMice\n\nDr Roux is principal investigator of sociOlfa, a project looking at how a mouse brain processes chemosignals when it encounters a new individual, and then uses them to create memories.\n\n\u2018Mice interact a lot by smelling the different body parts of other mice, and the nature of the smell will carry rich information (such as) the social status of the other individual,\u2019 said Dr Roux.\n\nAnimals use scent to mark \u2013 and detect \u2013 territory. In experimental conditions, if two mice fight, the one that wins will mark an area with its scent using urine. The subordinate one will also release a scent but only in one spot.\n\n\u2018A dominant mouse will have specific molecules to indicate they are dominant ones. And a sick animal will have signs of sickness within this odour mixture,\u2019 she said.\n\nFemale mice use scent to select a mate \u2013 usually preferring an unfamiliar male possibly because it promotes genetic diversity, says Dr Roux.\n\n\u2018For me it\u2019s a (form of) language. It\u2019s a way to communicate important information within a social group, important to maintain the hierarchy within the group, and it\u2019s very important for reproduction,\u2019 said Dr Roux.\n\nStudying how mouse brains process chemosignals will help researchers understand general principles of how their brains form social memories, says Dr Roux.\n\nAnd the results may be relevant in people too. Understanding how the mouse brain processes chemosignals during social interactions and when forming memories of an individual could help scientists identify what happens when these functions go wrong - for example, in mouse models of autism.\n\nEventually this could also help scientists understand what happens in people whose ability to recognise others is impaired \u2013 for example those with Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 or those who have difficulties with social interactions caused by autism.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o3tbux/bottling_the_smell_of_happiness_to_help_treat/", "title": "Bottling the smell of happiness to help treat depression", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Lopsided_Ad6035", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624147997, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o3tbux/bottling_the_smell_of_happiness_to_help_treat/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427108.1404002, "replies_charged": false}
