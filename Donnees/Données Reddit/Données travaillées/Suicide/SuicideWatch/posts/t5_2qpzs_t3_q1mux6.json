I enjoy marijuana and feeling sorry for myself, and I\u2019ve wasted precious time. I had someone in my life who pretended to care about these things. He felt sorry for me I think. He has left me now, and a specter of his voice lives rent free in my head. I imagine him holding me again. That\u2019s usually how I get to sleep at night. \nI breath heavy. I think it makes people turned off by me. I have a deviated septum and some pretty bad allergies. I hardly take care of it though so maybe it is on me. I\u2019m not overweight. I\u2019m not ugly per say, only unapproachable. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that fact. \nThe only thing tethering me to something that sort of looks like real life was him. Now, if a crazy doctor wanted to sedate me forever I\u2019d let him. Some sick fuck on 8chan wants to shoot a guy? Let him have a go on me. \nI miss you J, you made this miserable thing all worth it. \nI guess I\u2019m not suicidal, I am too risk averse to it. The ideation is there though, and that seed will grow.\nThe only consolation I can give to you and myself is that it seems there are a lot of us out there. Miserable people who are in a crisis, a crisis of Meaning. Keep fighting, and don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m tired too.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q1mux6/i_am_afraid/", "title": "I am Afraid", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "fruitissad", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633406138, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q1mux6/i_am_afraid/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427974.0288358, "replies_charged": false}
