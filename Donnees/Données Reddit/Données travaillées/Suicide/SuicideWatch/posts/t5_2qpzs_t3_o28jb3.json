People don\u2019t care or simply act like they do. I don\u2019t want to hurt people and I don\u2019t even want to hurt myself really but one thing I know is I genuinely don\u2019t want a future. \n\nOf course I like good memories but I\u2019m willing to sacrifice the opportunity to make more if it means stopping how I feel and avoiding the bridges of suffering that link these good moments. I\u2019m no longer actively suicidal except the odd overwhelming moment. But if anything this has made it harder because it\u2019s taken me further from the resolution I was comforted by in ways. \n\nI feel like to live is to suffer unless you\u2019re talented at making the best of bad and like I\u2019m allergic to existence. I feel suffocated and ignored or not taken seriously and under appreciated or just that other people lack consideration that I\u2019d consider common decency. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m going mad or turning bitter too, I just want to go but don\u2019t want to hurt my loved ones and continue the patterns of trauma.\n\nThanks if you read this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o28jb3/i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "title": "I don\u2019t know what to do.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Little-Raspberry7544", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623965739, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o28jb3/i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428219.1754153, "replies_charged": false}
