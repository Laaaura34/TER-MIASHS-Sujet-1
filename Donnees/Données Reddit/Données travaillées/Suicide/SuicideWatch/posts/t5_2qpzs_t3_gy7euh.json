I'm a 17 year old pre-transition trans female, and I've had the misfortune of surviving 3 painful suicide attempts due to the dumbest deux ex machinas. I'm writing this as a final cry of help, as I've had my neck in a noose at night for almost three weeks now, and yesterday I almost kicked away the chair. At this point, I'm done. In a week or two, when I can get everything finalized, I'm gonna make sure I don't mess up again, even if it means multiple painful attempts. My suicide note and unofficial will are planned and written. If I'm to die soon, why not give this a shot? \n\nHere's the sob story: my life is a mess. I was told at 8 by my father that my mother was going to die, and ever since I've been by her side trying to help her live with chronic illness. I've been dealing with other people's divorces, deaths/suicide, and abuse since that age as well. My father emotionally neglected and manipulated me all throughout middle school, when I was being bullied for race and weight issues (developed bulimia that still persists now), and when I was going through horrible dysphoric episodes on top of having multiple toxic relationships that could be considered assualt (both physical and sexual) and hardcore physical and emotional abuse, I failed to save so many of my friends from themselves as they ended up killing themselves.\n\nI ended up figuring out my gender identity by high school, but not until after a failed attempt drowning myself. When I came out to my parents, in the most traumatic night of my life they tried to murder me while killing themselves in a suicide pact. In an attempt to stop them from divorcing, I hid my identity again, but I developed insanely bad sleep issues from staying up as long as I could for months to ensure no one died. Even today, my sleep paralysis, insomnia, apnea, and night terrors make it so that I'm lucky to sleep 3 hours every two or three days. Regardless, even though the dysphoria that came from waiting destroyed me, I almost died again and the same divorce threats were made. I took as many pills as I could reasonably get my hands on, but I ended up involuntarily purging from food poisoning that day. From there, more close friends and family died, I ruined my leg with a horrible ligament injury, and the therapists I fought so hard to see practically gave up on me as they either tried convincing me I wasn't trans or prescribing worthless antidepressants they knew didn't work. I spent minutes dangling from a rope since it didn't break my neck. At this point, I'm sure you get it. I won't go more into detail, but there's even more baggage underneath just this.\n\nIn general, I've heard both my parents to dare me to starve and kill myself. I feel responsible for not being able to save 6 close friends from suicide. I feel like I've failed at everything I've ever done, and I feel so weak that I'm even feeling like this. I feel like my existence is the cause for so much pain and so much suffering for the ones I care about. Why am I alive? I'm destined to be a burden on the shoulders of better people (even like anyone willing to read this shitty post), and I find that the only things that bring me happiness nowadays is imagining how nice it would be if the world around me didn't have me in it. \n\nI'm fake. Everyone thinks I'm so funny and talented and cheery, but I'm a fraud. My talents are a result of lies and trying to give my life purpose, but even after I've gained national statuses in those fields, I feel empty. I'm nothing if not a lonely nobody who wants so much to be noticed and loved, but someone like me doesn't deserve such luxuries. I'm standing here pretending like I'm worthy of being called a someone, but a person wouldn't just exist to hurt their family and friends. A person wouldn't be so inexcusably terrible that friends and family make attempts on her life, nor would she let her friends die.\n\nAs cliche or edgy as it is, existence is truly pain (maybe that statement should show you how extra or how mentally weak I am). I can't eat without my bulimia making me purge and feel horrible for eating. I can't sleep without being physically unable to stay up, and then I'll be woken by horrifying night terrors. Talking to people is impossible as I feel so guilty making them have to worry or even think about me. Trying to be productive with work, school, or my hobbies only reminds me of my failures and how shitty I am at everything, and how I can never improve or stay dedicated to anything. Looking at myself causes physical disgust and sets my dysphoria into overdrive thinking about what ifs and regrets while just existing on any given day makes me start mentally systemically destroying my sanity with past events. \n\nObviously, I wholeheartedly believe the things I tried talking my suicidal friends out of. I don't deserve to feel this way; I have so much to be thankful for. The love that's been shown to me was out of pity from people who saw how much of an abomination I really am. The only reason I've been holding on for so long is because I truly believed that my family and friends did care for me, as my parents were trying their best to make up for their past abuse and change to help me and my friends seemed to care. None of my friends care to talk to me during quarantine anymore, and I increasingly feel like the pain I cause others isn't worth any amount of love anyone could possibly have for me. \n\nOn second thought, I lied. That's not the only reason. The other reason was because I'm a coward. I know how much I deserve death. I know how much it would help everyone if I were to just take the initiative. I'm a coward. I'm scared of what'll happen. \n\nPlease don't try and tell me stuff like \"people care, look how suicides impacted you.\" I'm not a person. They were. People cared. They were funny, talented, energetic, sweet, No one cares enough to even say hi after hearing that I almost killed myself the other day. My parents might be trying their hardest to atone, but I don't blame them for what they tried. Maybe they'll care at first, but I'm sure them and everyone who's had the misfortune of knowing me will secretly be happy I'm gone. Only those I fed on volunteer sessions will slightly mourn my loss, and when the organization eventually finds my replacement, just like all the others, even the ones I've fed for years will forget I even existed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gy7euh/after_failed_attempts_and_mulling_it_over_for/", "title": "After failed attempts and mulling it over for months, I've found the resolve to end it.
