So many of the counselors don't really care about what you're saying and take so long to respond that it fucks with my mind. The reason why I have to go to a hotline like that is because I feel like nobody in my life cares! Making me wait 10 minutes for a 3-word response makes it feel like you don't care!\n\nI'm already alone enough. I don't need anyone else making things feel worse, especially when that someone else is the very same resource I always get sent to when opening up to anyone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lpgg66/suicide_prevention_hotline_really_doesnt_help_much/", "title": "Suicide Prevention Hotline really doesn't help much", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "katesalwaystrying", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 50, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613973135, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lpgg66/suicide_prevention_hotline_really_doesnt_help_much/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427827.929649, "replies_charged": false}
