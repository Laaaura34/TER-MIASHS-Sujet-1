Both of us have a history of suicidal tendencies but in different ways; for him, drinking and self harm, for me a long lasting eating disorder.. And also self harm. We have always fought each other about these things to try to better the other even at our lowest ( me being hospitalized, him almost jumping off a 2 story building, etc.) however something tonight changed. We both had almost a psychic thought of a suicide pact... It was unsaid for a few minutes until i mentioned i wanted to slit my throat and he grabbed his knife and said not if i can't be first. I stopped him, but the conversation turned to how easy it would be for both of us to end it together. The fact is that both our attitudes towards each other's issues changed for a split, dangerous moment. It's one thing to be alone with suicidal thoughts, but to feel justified and together with your loved one taking each other out is quite a tempting desire.
