You never know when it comes to those guys. A lot of the time, people who make the decisions at the HO do so using stringent methods and end up missing many aspects of their cases.   Some people have ended up being killed because of the decisions they have made. So who the hell am I? From first glance, my life would be seen as that of a priviledged one and see me as just some kind of ungrateful brat (estranged from family due to history of mental, physical and mental abuse since childhood. Also a death from their neglect).  \n\nI have two fucking degrees in the STEM field. However, I can't land a fucking job to save my life. The companies that can hire me are oversaturated with people much more talented and smarter than I am (so they will not) and those that \\*\\*would\\*\\* hire me cannot because it's against the HO law (I'm not from thus country). This has already taken 3 years of my life. I have been homeless, don't qualify for government help (been turned away each time I asked for help) and literally had to go to a charity so I could get a roof over my head. And even then, I almost got kicked out because I didn't \"qualify\" to be helped by them. The employment help, I didn't even qualify for.   \n\nMental health services thought I was asking for help because I was homeless and made it obvious that that's what they thought. Mental health nurse said calling an ambulance would be a waste. And also said that she saw me at her church that Sunday so I \\*couldn't\\* possibly want to kill myself. Nasty words aside, a lot of the help I needed couldn't be accessed anyway because I'm not from here. So I didn't \"qualify\".   \n\nAt least there was an old woman that lived alone in charity's rented house so I guess one of the reasons they let me stay was to be able to help her. The little monetary help they used to give me (\u00a325 a week) was later withdrawn though. Because once again, I did not \"qualify\". I cried a bit (a lot actually) but I took it like a champ.   \n\nThankfully, my degrees now get me access to an exclusive benevolent fund for people in tech only. At least now, I can eat and have a roof over my head with their help. But knowing that you have to depend on others this badly to even be able to eat is soul crushing enough.   \n\nAt this point, I'm just tired. I'm tired of fighting, I'm tired of trying. The issues with my first rejection aside, this is the last time I'm trying to have a stable life. Once they give a rejection to this application, \\*\\*I'm done\\*\\*. I'm tired of trying to prove that I have some kind of right to be here, of having to prove the shit that I've been through, of trying to prove to those around me that just because you come from a family wih some kind of money, doesn't mean you can't be treated poorly as a child. I'm just tired. This is the last time I'm trying to chase some sort of stability.   \n\nYou usually have a short window to appeal a rejection (about 10 working days). I'll be using that time to nearly pack my stuff, have a deep clean of my room, my bathroom and donate the wearable stuff that I have to charity (I haven't gone clothes shopping since 2016 and most of my clothes are tattered and old but there's a few good stuff in there). At least the landlord wouldn't have to worry about a deep clean bills.   I know \\*\\*exactly\\*\\* how I'm going to go but I won't share because I'm unsure of the rules.   \n\nBut I would basically either clearing stuff from my room or neatly packing them up. Maybe have one last night out with some friendly flatmates, have a last outing with some close friends. To sort of say my \"goodbye\". I've been crying quite a bit this morning. Not sure why but I think it's me shedding tears for some people that may have been close to me over the past few years. This has absolutely nothing to do with them. I don't know if me leaving will affect or impactful to them in any way but I'll make sure to leave a note explicitly stating the fact that they had nothing to do with it. And that it is a conscious decision that I decided to make.   \n\nI'm generally a very private person and don't necessarily like being the centre of attention so I'd most likely go into the woods and phone the ambulance service once I've \"done it\" so they can come find my body.  After the experience I had with mental health services, I'm taking everything they say with a grain of salt.   \n\nMaybe, just maybe, when I've done I'm ready to \"leave\", I'll pass by emergency services to see what their response would be. If the response is anything remotely similar to my experience a year ago, I'll leave immediately and continue with my plan. If there's anything I get to keep, it's my pride and dignity.   \n\nThanks for listening to my story", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pr3kke/my_plans_get_clearer_as_time_pases/", "title": "My Plans Get Clearer as Time Pases", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ThrowRA_0A", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632037162, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pr3kke/my_plans_get_clearer_as_time_pases/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427106.3930192, "replies_charged": false}
