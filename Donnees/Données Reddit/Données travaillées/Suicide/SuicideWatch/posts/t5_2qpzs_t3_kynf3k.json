My career has been devoted to helping others. I have a history of childhood trauma and adult sexual assault and domestic abuse. I have been diagnosed with CPTSD and depression and anxiety several times. I am trying. I am trying to heal and am doing all the things I am supposed to in terms of getting help. Another context is that I am an immigrant and my home country is unsafe for me- I am trying to appeal to remain where it is physically safe but I dont know if it will work. I hear back next month. I constantly have flashbacks, panic attacks that last hours, nightmares, and am struggling with eating and sleeping. It has been this way for a very long time. I have kept a log and I mean LITERALLY I have had less than 4 hours of relief during waking hours for the last 6 months CONSISTENTLY.\n\nI am unsafe- But I also think something in me is so damaged and broken that I am starting to hurt others. After leaving my abusive ex, I just cannot stop stalking them. I know I am harassing them but I dont know how to stop. This is not okay. I feel like I am behaving in ways that my abusers have towards me in some ways and I cannot stop. My brain just cannot stop fixating on them and I am trying so so so hard every day to keep myself busy and not bother them but I fail each time. I cannot describe the lengths I have gone but I will say that I am definitely causing suffering to this person.\n\nNext steps- I am planning to kill myself by the end of February if I cannot remain in a safe country and see improvement in my mental health. Partly because being physically unsafe is something I cannot tolerate again. And I will be unable to receive any treatment for whatever is damaged in me. I just want to say that I am sorry and I dont know how to fix myself. I am a mess. I am constantly in pain and now I am causing people I love pain and I regardless of how much I try, I can\u2019t stop. So I have decided to end things not just for own self but especially for others. I am not a safe person for others and I feel unsafe inside my skin. I have too many demons. I have everything planned out.\n\nRegrets- I just wish I could finish some of the research projects that can have large scale positive impact. I am a smart person, I have worked very hard to be who I am. And I really really wish I was not suffering so much that I am having to leave instead of finish some of the projects I know I can accomplish and improve lives of hundreds of people\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am open to any insights. I am aware I am broken and harmful- no need to reiterate that. I am in enough pain already.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kynf3k/something_is_wrong_with_me_and_i_feel_like_i_am/", "title": "Something is wrong with me and I feel like I am an unsafe person now", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SuchaRoof", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610818997, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kynf3k/something_is_wrong_with_me_and_i_feel_like_i_am/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428132.2376356, "replies_charged": false}
