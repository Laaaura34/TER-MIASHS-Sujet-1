It feels like everyday could genuinely be my last, and I barely survived tonight, only through self harming did I not act on suicidal urges themselves, and now my whole arm stings like hell. To those of you who have survived unbearable pain, life circumstancess, and traumas up until this point, especially those of you who are isolated and alone.... I just want to  hear, how do you think you'll survive through today? Maybe your way/method could help me survive another day too.\n\nAnyways I am truly sorry to those of us with unbearable pain... I wish I could take it away from us all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qalpmi/to_other_chronically_suicidal_people/", "title": "To other chronically suicidal people;", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dear_pixel_heart", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 24, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634560174, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qalpmi/to_other_chronically_suicidal_people/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635421109.491256, "replies_charged": false}
