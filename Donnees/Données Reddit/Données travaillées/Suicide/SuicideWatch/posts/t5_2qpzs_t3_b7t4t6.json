I have already started the inheritance procedures that will give my mother all of my savings and know the location of my departure. All that remains is the exact method of my crime, which is made complicated that I need to be accurate and quick, to not give myself time to think and hesitate when the moment comes.\n\nI feel better. So much better. Everyday, I feel like I am running blind and screaming in panic in this world. All I feel behind my dark eyelids and inside my gut is shame, disgust, helplessness. But now it's gone. I know I will never be ashamed again. I know that soon this will be erased forever. I feel so calm, almost serene now that I know for exactly how long I need to continue this charade and when I will be free. I know that for this serenity, much like anything in this life, I will have to pay. And that is fair. I will pay on the day of my suicide, in a hotel room by the beach. I bought this serenity with the pact I made.\n\nI will never run in the darkness again.
