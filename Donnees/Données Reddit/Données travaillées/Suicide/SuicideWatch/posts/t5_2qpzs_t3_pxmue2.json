My parents were shocked and have been monitoring me ever since. (Also being in the hospital sucked so much).\nLately, I've been crying myself to sleep and have felt exactly like the days prior of my 1st attempt this year. I'm feeling guilty because I'm a disappointment to my family, they are just wasting time and money in me, because there's no fixing this.\nI'm scared that if I try again I'll end up in the hospital again and I definitely don't want that, my shrink wanted to admit me on a mental facility first time around (actually second but who's counting?).\nToday I managed to live by taking a non lethal amount of something that would ease my anxiety. Still wrote a goodbye letter.\nI'm unsure if what to do, a part of me wants to tell someone but how can I burden people with this when there's no fixing it. However, at the same time, I don't want anyone to suffer because of my death.\nAlso I've promised to not harm myself as a condition to not being hospitalized by my shrink, I'm just not sure if I can make it. I mean with every passing day, a little of me dies.\nIf you've made it this far, thanks.
