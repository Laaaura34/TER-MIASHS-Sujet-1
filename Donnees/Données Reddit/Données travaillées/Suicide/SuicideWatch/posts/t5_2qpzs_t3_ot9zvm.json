I would agree that I was meant to be with him except for one problem: I\u2019m certain that I\u2019m gonna snap and kms one day. \n\nI do love him and we do talk about our future together. It makes us both really happy, but secretly I feel so guilty deep down because I know it\u2019s very likely that all those dreams are gonna come crashing down when I snap and decide to get it done once and for all. \n\nWe did talk about having kids but I am afraid I will pass on my mental issues (not sure if they are genetic or not because I was abused as a child for about a decade) and also I would hate to create whole new people and then crush them by killing myself AFTER they are born. \n\nHe keeps telling me that he will never be normal again if I do go ahead with it, but I\u2019m so FUCKING EXHAUSTED. One failed attempt last year and I am still here on this shit earth. \n\nHow can I help him? I would like to minimise emotional damage. We met on a dating app so maybe I could find him another gf or something. Or I could be such a bitch to him that he actually becomes happy at the thought of my death?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ot9zvm/feeling_guilty_over_potentially_committing/", "title": "Feeling GUILTY over potentially committing suicide, how can I help boyfriend?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "caritasyu", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627479188, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ot9zvm/feeling_guilty_over_potentially_committing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428344.6767645, "replies_charged": false}
