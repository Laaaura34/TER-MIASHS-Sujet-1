I confided in my brother 3 days ago, with my depression, and about everything that has been bothering me. He has problems with my mother so he, immediately asked, \u201cit\u2019s because of mom\u201d? And I said no why would you say that? I confided in him, and I asked him not to tell anyone. He even texted me the day after trying to go check up on me. Somehow him and my mom got on the phone arguing (even though he\u2019s blocked) and he just blurted out \u201cYour son is ab to kill him self bc of you\u201d and I ran out my room, and told him that\u2019s not true. He lied to me and told my secret to everyone, and it was to hurt my mom. I can\u2019t stand him.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q8mqug/watch_who_you_tell_your_suicidal_thoughts_to/", "title": "Watch who you tell your suicidal thoughts to.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "wetuhtheriver", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 165, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634298397, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q8mqug/watch_who_you_tell_your_suicidal_thoughts_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635421081.7341387, "replies_charged": false}
