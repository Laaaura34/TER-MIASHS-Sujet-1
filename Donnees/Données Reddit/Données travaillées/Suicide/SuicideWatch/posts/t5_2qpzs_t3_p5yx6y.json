But day by day I care less and less about my close ones and what will happen to them if I did kill myself. So pretty soon the only thing stopping me is A: fear of failure (I only have one shot), and B: fear of annhilation, a pretty basic primal fear that's programmed into my DNA as with most other people. \n\nIs there really a difference to the world if I am alive or if I am dead? I see no potential in myself to change the world in a majour way, and anyways I don't have a desire. I don't care about the world that much honestly, it feels like a clich\u00e9 to say but it's true. I don't care for the world. I went to a lake with my family the other day. I swam in the lake, had fun, and we were surrounded by beautiful scenery. I felt no happiness when we were walking in yhe evening, looking at the beautiful lake surrounded by the mountains. I don't want to keep on living, make a couple friends, and experience the little joys in life. I don't want to be just another mediocre nobody like everyone I see around me. I don't hate anyone but I am impressed by absolutely nobody. I don't want to just keep breathing and live my life, see back on my current self as \"na\u00efve\" for not seeing the \"beauty\" in living and making friends and working and having a wife and kids and all that bullshit, and then die of natural causes at the end. I don't want to do anything. I can't even commit to anything even if I wanted to. I wanted to \"work out\" for the past year, but I dont actually want to do it. I joined a gym and stopped after 2 classes. I wanted to read but after getting a couple interesting books I don't want to anymore. And I am disappointed in my body's skeletal structure. Not the muscles or little fat, but the bone structure. My hips are naturally too wide, my shoulders narrow. My muscle insertions suck. Even if I DID work out, and put on muscle and got healthy, I would NEVER look beautiful. Im not disgusted, but disappointed in my body. Thats a tangent though.\n\nThe only reason Im making this post is for attention really, I haven't said a single word about my thoughts to anyone or online or anywhere else, nor anywhere irl like a journal. The world needs less of people like me,  unmotivated and genetically unadapted to the new cultural and everchanging environment. Not beautiful. And I feel like tons of people who kill themselves feel the same way. Isn't it best, from some sorta societal point of view, for the weak and the depressed to kill themselves? They get what they want, and the human race gets a little more closer to being only full of motivated people right? And if not, atleast it sheds its scum. Sure, there bad people out there. Corrupt politicians, serial killers, rapists. But do you think these people will be stopped by people like me? I don't give a shit about them. I don't give a shit about you. Fuck you. And I don't care for my family. I don't HATE them. They're incredible people. But I don't care about their struggles, about their pain, about their sacrifices, all that theyve done for me. Despite my knowledge of what theyve gone through and the inuustices they faced, I still want to end my life even if it means causing them an incomprehensible suffering. I only care about myself and my self loathing. The only reason Im alive is fear of dying and lethargy, not love. Why shouldn't I kill myself?
