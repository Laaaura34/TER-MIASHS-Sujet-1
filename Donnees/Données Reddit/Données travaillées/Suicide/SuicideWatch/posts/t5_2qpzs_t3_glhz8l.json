So often I feel like everything I do is in vain (which isn't a lot, to be fair). There's no point to anything. I'm not happy, I'm not sad, I'm just done. I consider doing stupid things like getting drunk or high, and I probably would if I had access to drugs or alcohol (yep you guessed it, I'm underage), but I don't so I'm basically fucked. There is no escape, if there's no point now when I'm meant to be young and \"free\" when will there be? Everyone tells me to just hold on and that things will get better eventually but that's usually from people my age who don't have a clue what it's like to feel like this, or adults who think they understand because they've been in a slightly similar situation to me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have my moments of extreme sadness and distress, but in a way this is worse because it tends to trigger sadness and distress which leads to me feeling extremely suicidal as opposed to just slightly. Does anyone else get like this?
