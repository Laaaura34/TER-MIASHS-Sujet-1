My wife and I seperated a few months back, she cut me out of her life because I am a toxic pos, and recently she relented because I am just that toxic, I think.\n\nHer family knows how bad I am, and is counselling her against me.

Sacrifice myself so that she can live in relative joy?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p9pwbt/the_needs_of_the_many/", "title": "The needs of the many", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Birdonawire54", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629683540, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p9pwbt/the_needs_of_the_many/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428190.4067986, "replies_charged": false}
