This is pathetic and long. I\u2019m self-aware enough to know how this sounds. And it doesn\u2019t seem all that deep - but it\u2019s a cumulative thing that has just further turned my heart to hamburger. I\u2019m on mobile: excuse the typos. \n\nBut I\u2019ve never loved anyone like him and never felt loved. Hell, I don\u2019t feel loved by my friends half the time. My parents were abusive, I practically raised my sisters and I can\u2019t remember one time when I haven\u2019t felt scared or needed to be alert. To fix it. \n\nI\u2019m 30. My only relationship was when I was 24. It was 2 months and not even enjoyable. I\u2019ve been cut deeply before but this one hurts the most. \n\nI thought I was doing the right thing by sticking up for myself after I said upon catching feelings that I wanted our friends with bennies situation to be more - he had just gotten out of a love-fades type long-term thing, so he said that while he cared for me he could t get more serious. I said, cool, I figured; I can\u2019t be your friend. When I said that he changed his mind pronto and we went back and forth. I stick to my guns and eventually had to block him for being disrespectful about boundaries a month later. We didn\u2019t talk for six months but I thought of him every day. On a particularly bad day in early Feb., I reached back out and apologized for blocking him, saying that I could have stuck to my boundaries without cutting him off. I felt so low that if he wanted to chew me out, i would hear all the bad shit I was feeling about myself already; if not, I get to talk to someone I care about. We made up. Became friends. My feelings were still there. I drafted a note saying I couldn\u2019t keep talking to him bc it still hurt - basically told him I still cared - then deleted it and rewrote it to be more general. I wish I had told him then. I didn\u2019t know I was allowed. We then started talking again when I realized I was consistently running away from real vulnerability in therapy. \n\nAbout a week before I reached out for the first time in Feb., He met another woman he didn\u2019t tel me about until he came to visit last week after I said we ought to meet IRL and invited him to stay at mine. We had immediate chemistry and all the work he did to see me as a friend, he said, vanished. This woman was coming this week and he was now deeply confused, so the plan was he\u2019d take the week to decide how he was feeling after meeting her. it wasn\u2019t me. I couldn\u2019t change his mind. \n\nI know: you\u2019re not an option!!! I get the prevailing wisdom. For some women, it would be harder to leave  - with him, I knew I loved him when I realized it was harder for me to stay and that he was worth it, sticking out my neck for him. I was pushing back against so many demons for this. I was learning to be vulnerable. I was viewing love as beyond my superficial beliefs and putting in the work, overtime work, outside of therapy. I was so stupid. \n\nAnd what kills me is if I had healed earlier - if I had liked myself like I knew I was supposed to, all of this wouldn\u2019t have Happened. The things I worked overtime to hide bc I was afraid no one would like? That was what he was looking for. And has found in this woman. This younger woman. \n\nWhen he came up to visit, he swore they weren\u2019t exclusive so we fooled around and he held me as we slept. That\u2019s the farthest I\u2019ve ever gotten with a man (hot tip: don\u2019t grow up an evangelical) and it felt so good. So good. So safe. I think part of the reason I\u2019ve been so closed off for so long, on top of everything else, is that if I started putting myself out there I\u2019d realize how much I was missing. Have missed. Sunk cost fallacy and all that. I was right. I can\u2019t go back to sleeping alone in my bed. I just can\u2019t. And I\u2019m relieved that he didn\u2019t have condoms and we had a moral crisis about what we were doing and didn\u2019t sleep together; I know I\u2019d feel worse if he took my virginity and then chose her. But I still wished we had slept together. So much. \n\nAnd I can\u2019t replicate those physical feelings with a stranger. There was some form of feeing there; the intimacy of knowing someone really well. The thought of finding a replacement person just for the feeing of someone next to me repulses me. I want *him* in my bed. Or a cutscene to the time when the right person, if they even fucking exists, finds his way there. \n\nI wish he didn\u2019t come up here at all so I never had a taste of what I couldn\u2019t have. \n\nHe\u2019s not even a mean guy. Not on purpose, anyway. I usually go for the assholes and he\u2019s not - at least in the traditional sense. And we\u2019ve talked so much all week - even when he\u2019s supposed to be with this woman, whom he\u2019s picking even though he tells me he loves me and seems so meh about her - and I know he feels badly. I thought this was real because he wasn\u2019t cruel or withholding - my usual type that codependent me just lives for - and I thought that was growth. Maybe he was just the same thing in a different package. \n\nAnd I\u2019m alone in this. He swears the choice nearly killed him, but I\u2019m mourning this thing alone while he\u2019s starting a new relationship. I\u2019ve seen the pictures she just posted tonight - he looks happy. I wish he didn\u2019t look so happy, even though I want him to be happy. It makes me feel like he never cared for me even a little bit at all, if it only took six months to get over me and considers our past too much of a hurdle. Nothing is too much if you care enough. So he just ... doesn\u2019t. I want to scream at him. I can\u2019t even bring myself to block him. And I stupidly posted a friendship picture to save on insta tonight FIVE MINUTES BEFORE she posts something of the two of them. I\u2019m a fool. GET ME OUT OF THIS LESSER EPISODE OF FLEABAG PLEASE. \n\nNo matter what he seems to imply about me leaving in August - I took so much time to explain to him why we couldn\u2019t be friends, even after I said to leave me alone; three phone calls, countless texts - this isn\u2019t my fault. I\u2019m trying to make it my fault, because if it was I could have an easier chance fixing it. Control issues and all that. \n\nAll my coping mechanisms are related to him, for one reason or another. We met on Reddit, for one, nearly a year ago. And life, quarantine life, is one big coping mechanism. I can\u2019t go anywhere; I buzzed my head in a fit of boredom and sadness and desire to have the hair off my head and know men wouldn\u2019t like how I look right now, so I can\u2019t start dating to replace him. I\u2019m in horrible debt so I can\u2019t go on vacation or get my nails done or eat something yummy beyond the basics to distract myself. Work is a slog. Therapy is trauma recovery and a new open wound every week. My life feels stolen from me bc of other people\u2019s unresolved pain and living in a cult. I know I\u2019m responsible for my life but I wish all my fucks ups weren\u2019t my fault. I get up, play AC, go to bed if I can fall asleep, have nightmares if I actually do pass out, do it all again. My best friends and the only sister I have left live across the country. I feel so alone. \n\nI have felt this deep, yawning despair for so long. I\u2019ve been itching towards snapping for ages and this ... I know rejection is a part of romantic exploration, but I\u2019ve been rejected again and again and again - since I was born, I have never been wanted. There are no wins to balance it out. Just an empty bed and time unfolding unremarkably before me. I can\u2019t do it.\n\nI want to be wanted. I want to be chosen. First place. I want someone to fight for me. \n\nI\u2019ve been bleeding over this wound for a long time, this attachment disorder thing my therapist tells me I have. This situation just happened to make it worse. I trusted him and that\u2019s why I thought things would be different; that I could heal just a little by knowing what it is to be loved. I kept opening myself wider to show him more of me so nothing was left unsaid - nothing could be wondered about - and even with my bloody heart in my hands, I wasn\u2019t enough to change his mind. Nothing I say or do is enough. He wanted to keep moving forward after all the work he did to get over me, when hearing words like the state I live in would make him sad. Even after he told me he realized that I realized that he using me for, in some ways, emotional stability after his own breakup. Even when he seems so meh about this other person. He\u2019d rather have meh than me. Than what am I? All he can say now is how worried he is about me. The pity. It almost hurts worse than the no. \n\nHe can\u2019t even consistently tell me no, either. It\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t have hope for us ever being a thing\u201d and then him saying over and over, \u201cnothing about us is 100% clear\u201d for the rest of the conversation. DECIDE, asshole.\n\nI will never not keep hoping that I\u2019ll wake up one morning and he\u2019ll have changed his mind. But he wouldn\u2019t because there\u2019s no pain in losing me. because he has this other girl. Who I know is blameless but whom I despise. Who I feel pity for because I know her brother just died horrifically, but also resent because I know he\u2019s the kind of person who would let that sway his choice. I\u2019m horrible. \n\nWe tried to be friends. It was impossible. Hearing about them - picturing them fucking - her in his bed ... it\u2019s ... \n\nI have been working on finding it within myself for my whole life. The love. My whole life has been learning how to survive totally alone. Please don\u2019t tell me I need more time by myself. I love my friends, but all the typical post-heartbreak pep talk mumbo just doesn\u2019t apply. I haven\u2019t had one romantic win. One. Your worst days don\u2019t come close to mine. You fundamentally do not understand how hard it is for me to wake up every morning and simply exist. I\u2019ve been hearing I\u2019ll meet my person - they\u2019re out there! - since my heart was big enough to break. Well, where the fuck are they? Part of me is afraid they\u2019re not coming. And that I\u2019ve been right the whole time. \n\nI hate that my cynical defense mechanisms have never once been proven wrong. Maybe I\u2019m a prophet. Even the tarot pulls and psychic consultations told me I was right. How lame am I? This is why keeping crushes to celebrities is easier - there\u2019s no instability when Chris Evans doesnt know I\u2019m alive and gets married, you know? \n\nI spent every night since I met him last summer thinking about him - even if it was just replaying something funny he said - before bed. Even when we weren\u2019t talking. Touching myself with him in mind, knowing how hard it all was wouldn\u2019t be in vain because I was choosing myself when he didn\u2019t. \n\nThe only way I can fall asleep now? I\u2019ve been taking sleeping pills every eight hours to crash every time I wake up. I\u2019ve basically been asleep for 24 straight hours and hope to do that again until Monday evening therapy. While they do their magic, I draft suicide notes to the people in my life or picture my robe tie getting tighter and tighter around my neck. What I\u2019d say to him. I know love means wanting the best for the other person, but he\u2019s become such a poster child for all this deep, unsurprising despair that I want him to hurt. Burn. Deeply. \n\nI want everyone to hurt. I feel so taken for granted. My friends and sister are worried - they should be. Finally I feel like people are taking the intensity of my pain seriously. I\u2019d be lying if I said it didn\u2019t feel good. \n\nAnd I know that come the summer, when I\u2019m reminded of how it felt to be in it, it will hurt all over. I\u2019ll have to do this work all over. That\u2019s the scary part of grief - when it isn\u2019t fresh and your friends are over hearing about it but you\u2019re sitting there as if it happened yesterday, only you know he\u2019s moved way the fuck on now, and you\u2019re more alone in this than you\u2019ve ever been. \n\nI\u2019m afraid of fucking up my attempt and living without a face or like a vegetable, and besides living without my dog, who\u2019s the only good thing, that\u2019s the only reason keeping me from doing it. I\u2019m even past the pain part. I don\u2019t believe in hell anymore - at least I tell myself I don\u2019t - so I know whatever comes next can\u2019t be worse. \n\nIt\u2019s fascinating to watch emotional me inch closer and closer to the edge I never thought I\u2019d reach while intellectual me take notes. The third me, the one that\u2019s just sitting here, thinks that I\u2019m not going to survive the week. And I hope I\u2019m right. \n\nI want to be honest with my therapist but I don\u2019t know about insurance coverage for in/voluntary holds and I can\u2019t afford the medical bills or to lose my job. If I\u2019m honest, I get locked up. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nPray for me, if you pray. And please just be nice in the comments. I don\u2019t want a lecture. And I\u2019m tired of talking about it with therapists and friends. I want it erased. \n\nI don\u2019t want to die but I don\u2019t see how to make the pain of my existence stop. I\u2019ve been trying so hard for so long.
