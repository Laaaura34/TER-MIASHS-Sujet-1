I haven't been able to work since February 2019 due to social anxiety and what I've gone through this year topped it all off. I'm also still stuck living with my abuser and developed severe agoraphobia, I've lost 80 pounds over the past few months, and am constantly doing drugs, I have health problems and nobody cares and even through medical help and hospitals / rehab and all that which I don't have health insurance for I don't see a way out of this. I just don't want to go out painful. To much insomnia constant anger and flashbacks, inability to feel pleasure, health problems, the list goes so far down. I don't see a point or way out of this. This isn't a cry for help, I've attempted several times, wasn't actually suicidal then. Now I just feel like I lost my whole youth to mental health problems and shit,now I'm some worthless nobody who's just deteriorating more and more and it actually hurts to be alive, I lost my entire life so far to mental health problems and don't have any real friends. Only pleasure I get is short term and comes at a cost.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9q9h0/i_dont_want_to_die_but_im_a_complete_burden_on/", "title": "I don't want to die, but I'm a complete burden on everyone and an emotional wreck", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "swimandfriends", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634439024, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9q9h0/i_dont_want_to_die_but_im_a_complete_burden_on/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426540.3379178, "replies_charged": false}
