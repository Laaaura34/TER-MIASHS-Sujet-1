This wasn\u2019t me last year this wasn\u2019t me last year, I was fat but mostly happy ,medicated right and working. Loving the people I worked with, hated the job. I could sleep, nap, socialise, be a normal me but now it\u2019s fading away. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m actively suicidal again but I don\u2019t want this existence either I hate waking up, (if I even sleep) another day of dread, of anxiety, of endless tears. My life is slowly slipping away and it\u2019s hurts so much I can\u2019t bear it my relationships I disappearing. I miss old me I miss natalie, she\u2019s so lost in the mess that is my mind. I fear I\u2019m never getting her back and eventually my fear of death and suicide will go and I will just do it.
