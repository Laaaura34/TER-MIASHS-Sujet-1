I wake up from nightmares every night and in the last two months they\u2019ve gotten even worse.\n\nQuarantine is fucking killing me slowly. I have to be careful due to being an autoimmune disease patient and as a result, I am basically alone 24/7. I can\u2019t focus on work and I am swamped with to-dos with no capacity to be productive.\n\nBeing isolated is causing all sorts of bad feelings around some particularly insidious shit that happened to me.\n\nI can\u2019t continue to be alone with my brain. I can\u2019t do six more months of this shit, and I\u2019ve seen several hospitals in my area bracing for this to last until mid-2021. I\u2019ve started binging and purging again and now I wonder what\u2019s going to kill me first? The bulimia or me? \n\nI FaceTime with people occasionally, but that\u2019s no substitute for real contact. \n\nI wish it was over. I want it to fucking stop. I just want to eat all of my psych and autoimmune meds at once and go to sleep and never wake up.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fz179l/whats_the_point_at_this_point/", "title": "What\u2019s the point at this point?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sarahkazz", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1586597594, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fz179l/whats_the_point_at_this_point/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422951.159618, "replies_charged": false}
