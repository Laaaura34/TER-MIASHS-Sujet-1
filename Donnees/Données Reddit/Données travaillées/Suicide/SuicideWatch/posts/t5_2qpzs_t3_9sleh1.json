We have a suicide pact now, and it somehow makes me feel more at ease. He was talking about driving to San Francisco and jumping off the golden gate, and I can\u2019t help but feel that it\u2019s such a peaceful way to die. Having someone share your feelings is so comforting. Now the only thing I have to worry about is if I\u2019m going to die a virgin, but realistically I\u2019d probably never lose it anyway haha  ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9sleh1/just_made_a_suicide_pact_with_my_best_friend/", "title": "Just made a suicide pact with my best friend.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "downinahole040502", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1540881058, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9sleh1/just_made_a_suicide_pact_with_my_best_friend/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427698.1218972, "replies_charged": false}
