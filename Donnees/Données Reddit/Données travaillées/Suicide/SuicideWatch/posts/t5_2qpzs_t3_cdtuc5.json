This is the only place that nobody knows my name.  \n\n\nI wanted to talk about this a long time ago, and I can't stand anymore. I really want to kill myself and I have a lot of plans to not fail again. I hate the place that I live, I never felt real love from anyone, my first love killed himself in my birthday (may 10th of 2015) and my first boyfriend cheated on me 3 times, after I passed through a rough 3 years feeling absolutely nothing but sadness and anguish.  \n\n\nI don't know how to properly use worlds. That's not my main language. I'm sorry if it's confused to understand.  \n\n\nI feel cold everytime, I feel like I'm already dead. I just need to get rid of this carcass. I'm ugly as fuck, I'm boring, I'm problematic and I don't want to feel like this anymore.   \n\n\nI'm exhausted from looking at myself in the mirror and almost throwing up everytime. I feel disgust of myself. That's horrible. I just wanted to be happy again and get rid of that melancholy that kills every piece of me over and over the days.  \n\n\nI'm going to commit suicide in 10th of May of 2020.   \n\n\nI don't know how to tell my parents or the people that I care for that I'm going away forever sooner than they expected.  \n\n\nMy dream was to have a family, but sometimes what we dream is very hard to complete.  \nI really wanted to have a motivation to live.  \nI guess at this point nobody convince me that's not the only way out.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cdtuc5/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/", "title": "I don't know what to do anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pixelednemesis", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1563262058, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cdtuc5/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427558.6054175, "replies_charged": false}
