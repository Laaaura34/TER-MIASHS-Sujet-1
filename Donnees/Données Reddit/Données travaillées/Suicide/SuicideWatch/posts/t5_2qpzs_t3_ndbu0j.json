I\u2019m ruminating about people who\u2019ve abandoned me or kicked me out of jobs, or told me off. What I wish I could say to these people is how much courage it took for me to even apply to that job, or talk to them. I truly believe I shouldn\u2019t have been born because I\u2019m a worthless nobody and a fuck up. Everyday I wish for death rather than life. I would just donate my life to someone whose fighting to stay alive right now. I\u2019m miserable and this probably puts people off. This post is for all of us who feel unwanted right now. \u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ndbu0j/unwanted/", "title": "Unwanted", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Dazzling_Delivery625", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621122913, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ndbu0j/unwanted/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428032.1458082, "replies_charged": false}
