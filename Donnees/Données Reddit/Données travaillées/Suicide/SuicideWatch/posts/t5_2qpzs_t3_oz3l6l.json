After not having any luck finding steady employment in my field, I quit my restaurant job a few months ago to go back to school for computer science. I\u2019m 99% sure I just failed my two summer classes. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with my life and everything feels hopeless. I want someone to talk to about my suicidal thoughts, but the last time I did that they sent me to a mental hospital for 3 days. WHY THE FUCK CAN I NOT JUST TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT THESE THOUGHTS AND LIVE MY LIFE AND CONTINUE TO ENJOY THE THINGS I DO. It\u2019s like I\u2019m being punished for my honesty. I tried calling the suicide hotline and they didn\u2019t give me any advice, just asked, \u201cwell what can you do to feel better?\u201d (I don\u2019t fucking know, that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling you!) and instead asked if I needed to be hospitalized (what a fucking joke).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oz3l6l/i_just_want_someone_to_talk_to_about_having/", "title": "I just want someone to talk to about having suicidal thoughts without the risk of being institutionalized.
