Everything is great. \n\nBut I cannot help feeling suicidal. I cannot help feel worthless. \n\nIf I have to count my blessing, I can make a novel out of it. But that really doesn't help me not feeling suddenly suicidal out of nowhere. Sometimes when I'm doing some random stuff that thought will come to me suddenly, and so intensely I feel terrified about that ideation. \n\nSometimes I feel worthless because my suicidal ideation doesn't come from a place of abuse or trauma. I'm feeling unworthy for my ideation because I'm not supposed to have them when I don't have any trauma. \n\nAnd I know if I ever go through my suicide, my family, my friends will mourn for me. Everytime I think about that I feel unworthy of their love. \n\nEverytime anyone talked about future, I just freeze. Because I don't know if I want to have a future or not. \n\nI just tired.
