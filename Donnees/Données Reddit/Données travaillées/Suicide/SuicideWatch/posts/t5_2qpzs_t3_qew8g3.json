Provides my basic needs as required by the law. Buys me some nice things when we can afford it and loves me. But sometimes, he doesn't listen, he yells, takes my my things away for weeks at s time just because I wasnt in the mood to argue about something he did. He always acts like hes perfect and acts like me and my sister are just people hag can do no right. He yells at my sister for not being a perfect driver when she just got her permit. Not yelling as in helping yelling, whatever tha means. Calling her stupid, moronic, saying \"why are you even driving,\"you're stupid\" hours later, he denies all of that and acts as if he is just jesus christ reincarnated. My sister and I both have wished they he and my mom just get divorced. My mom isnt that bad, but never stands up for us. Sometimes when he yells at her, all we hear is crying from her bedroom. The only times I'm not suicidal is when hes away travelling for his job. Sometimes is weeks, which is great, and sometimes it's only for a day, but no matter how long those are the best days in my life. All of this, while it's not as bad on the surface as a physically abusive father, just makes me want to kill myself. I dont sleep much, I just lay awake staring. I get mad so easily. I just dont know what to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qew8g3/what_do_i_do/", "title": "What do I do", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MysticalTurtle716", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635094893, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qew8g3/what_do_i_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427630.1411028, "replies_charged": false}
