I started a page on FB to try to post positive stuff because of all the despair I found here. I wanted to help be someone for someone else but I have no friends and no one cares about me. I have little kids. I\u2019m autistic and my husband hates me. I feel stuck. If I leave I\u2019ll probably just end up homeless even though I have a nursing degree, because my autistic personality and insomnia made it very hard to work and I got fired from my last job over it. So what\u2019s the point in anything? Why try? Why not just kill myself? My husband doesn\u2019t care. My kids would be traumatized though. So I am just stuck. Alone. No better off than I ever was. I should have killed myself a long time ago when I first felt this way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pvh96h/why_try/", "title": "Why try", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Brief-Fan-4437", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632609774, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pvh96h/why_try/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426533.4815924, "replies_charged": false}
