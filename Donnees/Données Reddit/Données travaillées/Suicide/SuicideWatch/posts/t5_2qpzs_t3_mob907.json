While it was already a complicated situation, I chose what I chose and made it worse. It\u2019s been a year and now that the person I love is back in my life as a friend... not sure how I can get past all this. Not sure if I\u2019m allowed to. She hasn\u2019t moved on from it either- and that\u2019s fair. I hurt her trust and everything.\n\nI like to think I\u2019m a better person now but who knows.\n\nI can\u2019t keep living with this guilt and knowing I did that\n\nI can\u2019t keep doing this to the people I love.\n\nI fucked up. I hurt her. I can\u2019t live with that. I can\u2019t do this.\n\nHow can I say I love her when I did that? How can I even have the audacity to cry about it? How? \n\nI\u2019m not close to home and I feel so alone here. I love her and she\u2019s here but.... I am reminded of what I did and I deserve that. Tho I can\u2019t handle it\n\nWhy am I here? She says she wants to live with me and idk why she\u2019s back in my life like this... i don\u2019t hate her. I\u2019m just confused\n\n\nI\u2019m so stuck and I don\u2019t think life will be better", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mob907/wont_keep_this_up_long_but_i_need_it_let_it_out/", "title": "Won\u2019t keep this up long but I need it let it out.
