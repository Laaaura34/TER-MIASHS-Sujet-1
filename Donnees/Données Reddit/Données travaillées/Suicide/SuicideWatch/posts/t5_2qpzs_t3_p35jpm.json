I felt suicidal since I was 12 when I was getting bullied in high school. this feeling only gotten worse as the years progress. I hate myself for living, I blame myself for being bullied and I can't get over the death of my girlfriend and not knowing whether or not she was pregnant at the time of her death. It's all this doubt and self loathing I can't stand anymore. nothing in my life has improved, I'm unemployed even though I have the correct qualifications. I think during september, I'm going to find a bridge near where I live and just turn it in. no-one will miss me I know that, hell. I haven't been much of anything. I want to die and I can't find reasons to carry on that are valid enough for me to carry on. I have been living for other people but not for me while all my peers around me live successful lives and gloat about it on social media. I'm just tired of living.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p35jpm/its_nearly_my_birthday_its_been_over_a_year_since/", "title": "It's nearly my birthday, it's been over a year since my last suicide attempt.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JadedDragon173", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628792168, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p35jpm/its_nearly_my_birthday_its_been_over_a_year_since/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428541.2101502, "replies_charged": false}
