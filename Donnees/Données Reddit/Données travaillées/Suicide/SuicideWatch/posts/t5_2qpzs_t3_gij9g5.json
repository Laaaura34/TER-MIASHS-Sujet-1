I ended up just having a really bad dream and then I woke up twice to vomit. It's now 48 hours since I did that and I'm still shaking and hyper aware of everything. If your wondering my reasoning behind it, let's just say that certain people need to learn that their actions affect other people. No it was not a break up. But this person who shall not be named has been doing things that make me upset for months. It really hurts. And it kinda shatters my fragile masculinity talking about my feelings like this but I really need to say something because I'm scared and tired and sick of being stuck in the same place and I have problem with hyper-fixation and so many other fucked up things and I'm tired of being the kid who everyone tolerates out of pity. I'm scared and I don't know what to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gij9g5/i_did_a_bad_thing/", "title": "I did a bad thing", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "_Satan_the_Devil_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1589314123, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gij9g5/i_did_a_bad_thing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428160.4930248, "replies_charged": false}
