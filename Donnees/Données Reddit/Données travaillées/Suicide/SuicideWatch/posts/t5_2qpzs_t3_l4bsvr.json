How is anyone supposed to enjoy the small things in life when everything you do is fixated on creating a better future for yourself? My future is bleak and barren--i can barely see it, to tell you the truth it looks like i'll be swinging under a rope before i'm able to be content with this existence. I'm trapped in a prison of my own creation, can't live with this constant mental suffering but i'm expected to stay alive or i'm selfishly hurting those who care about me. What the fuck? Why should i care? WHY DO I CARE? Fuck. \n\nI wish i had the stomach to just end it right now, i'm afraid to die and afraid to live and seek happiness - thinking i'll be dead soon enough is surprisingly keeping me sane. I'm stuck here yet stagnantly decaying as everyday passes me by, i wish i was dead and wiped from everybody's mind. Fuck this pointless march towards a sense of happiness, i don't need it, i need freedom from my own brain - something only death can grant me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l4bsvr/stagnant_yet_stuck/", "title": "Stagnant yet stuck", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "shoottheparty", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611535055, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l4bsvr/stagnant_yet_stuck/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428154.046376, "replies_charged": false}
