My parents never took it serious and made fun of me. All I ever heard is, that I am a loser and will never achieve anything. \n\nI am ok in my life, have a solid job and gathered a few friends. But I always have this fear inside me. I had suicidal thoughts since I was 12. I only talked to a professional and always heard \"you are too young\", \"life will turn\", \"you will be happy\", and so on. I had an abusive relationship in my early 20s. I again heard the same sentences. I was at an all time low, when she broke up with me.\n\nI said to myself. Ok. One final time. Life will be good. So I tried. I am doing Sports. I am eating healthy. I am going out. Everything you can read and hear basically. And then I met her. Literally straight out of my dreams in every aspect.\n\nAnd then again its me who messes everything up. I have a slight anger problem and talk in a bad way to my parents a lot, because of the past. I started talking to my GF in that way and I am not proud of that. She told me, that she loves me but does not want to be with me, since it only gets worse and worse.\n\nI stopped drinking Yesterday and want to eat 3 packs of insomnia medication, so I sleep to death. But the biggest problem I have is, that I do not know how, because I have this fear about her. She was suicidal and I know that this would be incredibly harsh for her. She does not deserve my problems and issues. I really just want to vanish as if I never existed. Even when she breaks up, she is literally the only reason I am not cold by now. But I really do not want to hurt her even more, than I already did. I just want to have an aneurism or stroke and I pray for that every morning, but with no help. How do I get rid of this fear?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pcqd7r/the_fear_of_others/", "title": "The fear of others", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sad-Surround6358", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630080520, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pcqd7r/the_fear_of_others/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426589.0353208, "replies_charged": false}
