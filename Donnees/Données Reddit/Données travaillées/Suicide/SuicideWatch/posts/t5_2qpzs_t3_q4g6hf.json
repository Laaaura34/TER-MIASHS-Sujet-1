I get the idea of not being able to do it. I have the best support system (family, friends, university, therapist) and it\u2019s all making me feel guilty. I get the idea of suicide, not actually doing it but only thoughts. I think that after finishing my studies to do it. I am scared of doing it. How it will break those around me, and how selfish the act will be with all that support. I feel empty and full at the same time. I don't know what to do. I feel lost. I don't like to make new friends, so i just go to classes and sit alone trying not to talk to anyone. I always think to my self (why are you depressed with all that support?!) I don't know why. I know I might not get better mood wise, but might get better in dealing with it. A person once told me that sometimes the only solution might be to accept depression and just let it sit there as your friend, to embrace it as a part of me, to not resist it. I got a new diagnosis before leaving home (Bipolar II), and since then I am worse than before. I am scared.\n\nThank you for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q4g6hf/i_am_lost/", "title": "I am lost.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DoonalaG", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633763414, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q4g6hf/i_am_lost/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427665.4557126, "replies_charged": false}
