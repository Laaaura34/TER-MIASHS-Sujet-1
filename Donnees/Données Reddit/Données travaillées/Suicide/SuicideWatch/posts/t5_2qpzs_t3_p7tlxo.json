This has been going on for years. I know I'm not a failure and that I'm just probably slow, but my father really won't shut up and I'm starting to believe everything he says about me. He knew about my suicide attempt a year ago and he didn't seem concerned at all. Actually none of my family members did. I kinda just wanna kill myself to not go thru the cycle of disappointing everyone and myself. I feel so overwhelmed all the time. I feel so anxious. We just moved to another country and I feel so directionless like I don't deserve to live.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p7tlxo/i_think_my_father_hates_me_bc_im_a_failure/", "title": "I think my father hates me bc I'm a failure", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Jarush34", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629428046, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p7tlxo/i_think_my_father_hates_me_bc_im_a_failure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426951.9918585, "replies_charged": false}
