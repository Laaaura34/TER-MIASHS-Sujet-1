I made a pact with myself a year ago that if my situation didn\u2019t get any better, that I\u2019d go ahead and off myself. \nWell, it\u2019s been a year, and to be completely honest, it\u2019s only gotten worse. College makes me physically sick and suicidal but my mom has convinced me that if I don\u2019t go any only choice would be being a deadbeat with no degree who would work minimum wage for the rest of her life. My family says they accept my lesbianism and yet they continue to try and find \u201cthe right guy for me\u201d. I can\u2019t live like this anymore. \nI don\u2019t know for sure how yet, but I assume hanging wouldn\u2019t be too hard to carry out. My mom has a death grip over my life and it\u2019s impossible to be happy while she still exists. I\u2019m 18 and I just want it to be over already. I want to fall asleep and then wake up as a brand new person with a new life. \nI\u2019m going to miss my friends a lot. I\u2019m sorry I worried you, you really meant a lot to me. I don\u2019t want anybody feeling guilty over this, it\u2019s for the best I just try and start all over again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g5mxq5/im_probably_going_to_do_it_tonight/", "title": "I\u2019m probably going to do it tonight.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "imsuperfrickinsad", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1587500735, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g5mxq5/im_probably_going_to_do_it_tonight/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427759.4024363, "replies_charged": false}
