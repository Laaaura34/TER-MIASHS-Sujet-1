It\u2019s hard to keep swimming,I\u2019ve always been barely just able to keep my head above water. I was born into a violent, sexually and mentally abusive family. Everything I have ever loved has been taken from me continuously throughout my life. If I find something that makes me happy or finally feel comfortable somewhere something happens that makes it impossible to continue or I lose a person or pet to death or my living situation changes and I have to leave it behind. I own  a car, a tv and PlayStation 4. I\u2019ve worked hard my entire life. I don\u2019t let myself get attached to anybody or anything. I merely exist at best and struggle to survive most of the time. I have a shrink  I have been to counseling but it never helped because I had to lie to protect my parents and brother from going to prison. In the last 8yrs all have passed so I can talk about it now, I haven\u2019t taken the step to restart counseling yet because I have to move again, of course. I\u2019m on kpin,duloxetine,mirtazapine and he recently added a new med but I can\u2019t remember the name. They help manage symptoms now but my condition is worsening at an alarming rate. I\u2019m the lowest and closest I\u2019ve ever been. I held onto the hope that someday it would change, all the suffering would end because of my hard work. I started losing hope about 15yrs ago and now it\u2019s completely gone. I am truly hopeless,everything logical in me tells that based on the past I should give up. Honestly at this point I don\u2019t know why I haven\u2019t. The urge hits me so hard now that I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t own a fire arm or I may be dead already. I came close to sticking a very large knife through my throat about 4 months ago.All the pain swelled and reality once again set in that breathing one more breath was pointless,I had cut some tape with it earlier in the day and had left it on my night stand. I just grabbed it rather emotionless and thrust it so hard at my self I knew it was going to sever both jugular veins I knew I was going to be dead in maybe a minute and I was so happy. The best feeling I have felt in my whole lifetime pain was over. I can\u2019t explain why but I couldn\u2019t force the knife to even touch my skin even though all this happened in an instant, it was like a mental block but from where I don\u2019t know. Every fiber of my being wanted (In some way needed)it so badly. I\u2019ve been very scared since that happened because of the happiness I felt,It was bliss. I feel like I crossed a line, I got that taste of happiness and peace and even when I\u2019m not all that depressed I want that feeling again and I want it to last for ever or as long as my forever lasts as my neurons stop firing. This isn\u2019t a cry for help,a threat or a fishing trip for sympathy or support. I\u2019m just putting my feelings into writing and I really don\u2019t know why.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nzfwyw/everything_seems_pointless/", "title": "Everything seems pointless", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Rocon508", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623649938, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nzfwyw/everything_seems_pointless/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422300.2948241, "replies_charged": false}
