I don\u2019t mind. \n\n-\n\nHe called them \u201chappy pills.\u201d He had \nonly tried them once with his girlfriend and he said it was a nice experience. He asked me if I wanted to try with him because he knows how sad I am all the time. He convinced me easily. I was genuinely excited to feel happiness again and have a fun time with my best friend. He told me to start with one pill but, 45 minutes to an hour later, nothing was happening. So we both took another one. Then again later one more half. 30 minutes later I started panicking as if I was going to have a heart attack. It\u2019s like I was feeling ten times worse than usual. I was going insane, lying on my bed on my left side, clenching all my muscles for what felt like an eternity. I couldn\u2019t stop rubbing my right foot on my left one and I ended up tearing my skin. My friend was starting to comfort me, telling me how sorry he was, that he should\u2019ve known better. He genuinely felt bad, I could tell. When I wasn\u2019t clenching my teeth or telling him how terrified I was, I kept biting the inside of my cheek as hard as I could and it almost felt good. He noticed what I was doing when he saw my bloody teeth. He helped me drink some water, told me it was important. \n\nI was in this state for over two hours. I kept telling him how unhappy I was. How I wanted to be happier but couldn\u2019t, that my disease ruined my life and that I wasn\u2019t brave enough to get help. I went on and on, always repeating the same stuff. \n\nUntil I got angry at myself. I told him how pathetic I was. He said I wasn\u2019t. Then it just came out, just like that, something I never thought I\u2019d tell anyone. \n\n\u201cI hate myself so much that I get off on humiliation.\u201d \n\nFor well over a year now, I somehow turned my insecurities into sexual pleasure. Stuff that I have seen in porn that I took too seriously. I hate porn. I have always been attracted to women. I think they are awesome. And yet, I can\u2019t think of being with a woman that wouldn\u2019t love to potentially kill me. I can barely imagine myself in a loving relationship anymore. All I see is a cruel looking woman who will do anything to destroy my soul. And I like it. I hate that I like it. I would never imagine those things if it wasn\u2019t for porn. I don\u2019t think women are evil, I will never hate them, I\u2019m not stupid. I hate myself and only myself. I\u2019m just confused how I let this happen. Years ago, a woman\u2019s skin against mine was the sexiest thing. Now I think of them beating me as if I was nothing. I hurts me so much. This is not who I am. I know it isn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t like that before. \n\nI remember precisely the day when I lost my confidence. I was 12 years old. New year of school. I kept thinking \u201cwhy is it so hard for me to talk to others, now?\u201d I used to be the clown. Making people laugh made me so happy. I wanted them to like me so I did everything I could to make them laugh. I had a lot of friends. I wanted the attention because I was afraid to be alone. Most of my friends were kids who were alone. We always invited them to play with us. Last year of elementary school was where my life was going to get worse with every passing year. When I noticed how different I was I thought \u201cAm I just more mature so that\u2019s why I don\u2019t act like a buffoon anymore? Maybe puberty?\u201d That\u2019s what I wanted to think. Looking back now, I was just dealing with mild depression. \n\nIt stayed the same for a good six years until I turned 18. I was not happy to become an adult. I was fucking scared. I was already feeling like I wasted my teenage years. Never meeting new people, always the same old stuff. I could\u2019ve had a couple girlfriends over these years, I knew some of them were interested in me, but it just felt so exhausting just thinking about the day we would break up and how it would hurt me. I can\u2019t take rejection, it\u2019s a big part of why I  convinced myself of how much I \u201clove\u201d solitude. \n\nAt the end of high school, I was just more or less the same guy that I was all those years before that. \u201cHey man, wanna come to our party?\u201d I didn\u2019t go. Could\u2019ve met new friends. \u201cWanna try improv with us?\u201d Of course not, I\u2019m too shy for that and I obviously wouldn\u2019t be very good. \n\nI spent all my high school years with the same group of friends. We loved to go where it was restricted. Can\u2019t go in the auditorium? You bet we\u2019ll go, we\u2019ll even eat there by ourselves everyday. Can\u2019t go into the sewers to chill? Well, no matter how weird, we had to go (I even brought a girl once because I\u2019m that good with girls. She didn\u2019t seem to mind  and we talked for a pretty long time in there. I\u2019m what you call a gentleman). \nCan\u2019t go on the rooftop? We\u2019ll find a way (we never did). Principal hated us but he always told me that I was a smart kid who\u2019s better than this. I liked his comments more than I thought at the time. \n\nAt least I had a bit of fun, even if I never really experimented with anything else than just being a dumbass. I liked to draw, I wanted to become a comic book writer and artist. I was pretty good but never motivated enough to become better. I never stopped writing though (in my first language French at least). I liked to play the guitar but I have always been mediocre. I could see myself performing a mean solo in front of an intoxicated and overly enthusiastic audience. Still, I couldn\u2019t practice hard enough to get there. \nAt that point, I simply thought I was incredibly lazy. I wish I was. \n\nThe end of high school was the beginning of the end for me. No idea what I wanted to do. I love writing stories. They used to be about zombies and some outlandish stuff like assassins who can do anything. I got more into movies. Started watching hundreds of them and I thought, being a filmmaker must be great. It was my goal. To bring my imagination to life. \n\nTwo years later, now. I\u2019m 20. I want to make movies. I still write stories but I never finish them. They all have at least one character that is basically me. Recently I wrote about a man who fights in some underground fight club but he\u2019s so good he always win even though he just wants to die. He\u2019s waiting for someone to kill him, everyday, but it never happens. The day before he felt he really was going to die soon (his body took too much damage over the time) he met a woman who had just lost her dog, her only friend. She\u2019s nice and spunky but deep down she feels lonely. The man likes her and he keeps winning his fights to always meet her in the same park every night, talking on a dimly lit bench. He still dies though, finally losing a fight when he finally had something good, because he\u2019s fundamentally an idiot who can\u2019t make the right choices in order to achieve happiness. As a result he hurts the woman who blames herself for not helping him, even if it\u2019s not her fault. \nI want to develop this more and make it into a movie. I feel like I could do it. I just won\u2019t. \n\nThese last two years I went to cegep (some bullshit useless garbage school that is only meant to stress you the fuck out and damage you even more on an emotional level) \n\nTons of work to do, so little people to meet. Only had one friend there. In the end I couldn\u2019t even go to my classes. I didn\u2019t even have the strength to climb up the stairs. I kept going to the library, watching whatever on Netflix. All I had was my job at McDonald\u2019s. I loved the people I worked with at night. Hated the others during the day. I fucked it up eventually and was basically fired even though I technically quit. That still hurts to think about. I had a date during that time frame. It was horrible. Don\u2019t know who was the most boring between me and her, probably me, but Thor Ragnarok really wasn\u2019t enough to bring us together. \n\nAll in all, that\u2019s a lot of failures in a row. Got expelled from school for failing every single classes. Lost my job. Failed at romance. It hurts me so bad that I can\u2019t even bring myself to try again. \n\n\nBack to the bad trip part, yesterday. I have been doing nothing for 4-5 months now. Anyway, during the event, I tell my friend all of this but he doesn\u2019t judge me. He even held me in his arms and I cried. I was still panicking because of the severe depression/drugs mix. I don\u2019t do well with drugs. I told him I was scared of dying. He told me I would be okay. I went into too much details about the humilation thing and I\u2019ll just leave it at that, it pains me just to think about it. Just know, it\u2019s awful, it\u2019s gross. He could\u2019ve left me right there, never talk to me again but he stayed, told me I was his best friend, that he cares for me. I fell asleep some times later after apologizing so many times. \n\nThe next day, I am uncomfortable. Deeply embarrassed. He tells me I shouldn\u2019t be. He\u2019s proud that I talked about my feelings. He wants me to get professional help. He asked me if I wanted to go see a movie, to clear up my mind. I accepted. On the way there, everything looked weird. Almost unreal. I can\u2019t describe it. I just felt like I was alone in the world with only him next to me. I got more relaxed during the movie, I even smiled a little. I don\u2019t deserve my best friend. \n\nThen I got back home. I took a shower and I contemplated cutting my veins with a razor blade and die right there. You want to know why I didn\u2019t do it? I didn\u2019t want my mother to find me on the floor, naked in my own blood. This is ridiculous. I\u2019ve been thinking of ways to die without upsetting anyone I love as much as I could. There just isn\u2019t a way at all. I\u2019d hurt them anyway, no matter how I die. \n\nThat\u2019s what I hate the most. I\u2019m so tired. So fucking tired. I can\u2019t do anything. I have zero energy. When I went to see that movie, it was the first time in two weeks that I went outside. I don\u2019t consume nearly enough calories. I don\u2019t exercise anymore. I can\u2019t even finish TV shows I once loved. I\u2019m convinced that I won\u2019t even be there for the final season of Game of Thrones and I fucking love that show, man. So why am I not sticking around? I just don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m like that. I used to watch so many movies. Now my movie watchlist is packed, I own many of them and I don\u2019t even care about watching them. I want to but I can\u2019t even do that. \n\nIf I don\u2019t die soon, I\u2019ll be a vegetable in a few months. \n\nIt\u2019s my time to go. I don\u2019t belong here. I hate living. There\u2019s nothing waiting for me. I live for other people and that\u2019s it. I want to do something for myself, now. They will be sad but my pain is unbearable and I can\u2019t keep going. \n\nI just want to read some of your comments if you made it all the way down here. I don\u2019t do that everyday and I wanted my story to be written here so that someone understand why I did it. \n\nI can\u2019t see myself being alive in the following weeks. I\u2019ll just kill myself tomorrow, fully clothed in a warm bath so that I look decent when they find me. I don\u2019t want to suffer so I\u2019m cutting my veins quickly underwater. I will be listening to Heatmiser\u2019s Christian Brothers as my last song. \n\nMy name is Hugo. \n\n\nEdit: January 24th, still around.
