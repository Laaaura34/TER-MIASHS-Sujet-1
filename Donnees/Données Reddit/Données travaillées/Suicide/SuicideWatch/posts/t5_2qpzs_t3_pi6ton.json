We've been together for almost 6 years, she's my best friend, my moral support, my wife and my everything. And i don't feel like living anymore. It feels like the world is different. I feel so empty, i lose interest to everything. My chest hurts everyday. It's so traumatic. I just want to be with her again. The pain keeps growing each day and i can't take it anymore..\n\nHow could this happen to me? I love her so much.. she taught me how to stand with my own feet, we have so many plans together for our future, she was always there when i'm so down. we play games together, we watch anime together, we share the same hobbies. Lossing her feels like losing my own soul. My friends keeps saying i should move on like wtf is that? \"Move on\"?... Since then i stopped talking to them.. \n\nI want to be with her again..\nSoon.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pi6ton/my_gf_died_last_week/", "title": "My GF Died last week", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GamerspotPH", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 154, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630818029, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pi6ton/my_gf_died_last_week/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425178.364014, "replies_charged": false}
