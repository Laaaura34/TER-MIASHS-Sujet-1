Not a single person. I\u2019m 22 years old, I graduated from high school in 2017 and I lost all of my friends after high school. During high school I was so happy, I really did peak in high school. I had so many friends, I was always out of the house. Well, things are completely different now. I am always home, the last time I left my house was 5 months ago, I went shopping with my dad. After high school I tried going to community college but no one seemed interested in being my friend, people would actually ignore me when I tried speaking to them so I dropped out and haven\u2019t went back. I have been lonely for so long, it has gotten to the point where I have developed social anxiety and I can\u2019t stand the thought of leaving my house. I can\u2019t even get a job because the thought gives me anxiety. All of this just because I lost my friends and couldn\u2019t make new ones. I\u2019ll never have friends and I\u2019m gonna kill myself. What\u2019s the point of being alive if I\u2019m just a pathetic lonely loser?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9zrd4/depressed_and_suicidal_because_i_have_no_friends/", "title": "Depressed and suicidal because I have no friends.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ok-Maintenance1074", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 71, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634480830, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9zrd4/depressed_and_suicidal_because_i_have_no_friends/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635421084.8120584, "replies_charged": false}
