Just random moments throughout my day will happen, and eg i'll see a ray of sunshine or look at my cat doing something cute-- just little moments i find so so perfect and i tell myself, life is so extremely perfect in this moment and i've reached a checkpoint, or life cannot possibly exceed this perfect moment.... so now i'll go back to my real-life.\n\nEspecially the ray of sunshine, i see white light and i almost wait for it absorb this vision im having, like i imagine the light will increase slowly and swallow me whisking me away from this vision i know as life.\n\nIts really a specific type of thing thats happening i really couldnt find anything online similar to it. Though i understand how ridiculous it sounds, i feel like i wholeheartedly believe it and secretly hope one moment i will actually leave this dream type of world. I've always had this idea in the back of my head for a long time but only now does it feel so incredibly real.\n\naaa sounds crazy but i dont know how else to explain it, if anyone has any idea what this is similar to please let me know or anything to help thank you.\n\nAlso:\n\nIm 17 right now and live with my parents, I have quite bad anxiety and depression, hopefully seeing a psychologist soon.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pw4qdk/abnormal_suicidal_ideation_dissociation/", "title": "Abnormal Suicidal Ideation + Dissociation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Mazzy-Star8144", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632698379, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pw4qdk/abnormal_suicidal_ideation_dissociation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427200.2950137, "replies_charged": false}
