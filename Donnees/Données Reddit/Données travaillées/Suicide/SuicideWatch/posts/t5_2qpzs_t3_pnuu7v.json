I don\u2019t feel anything now except for stress, anger and sadness. Even when I\u2019m around people that I used to enjoy being around I just don\u2019t feel a single thing. I have such a hard time connecting with anyone because I\u2019m afraid of losing more people that I care about. Everyone looks up to me like I\u2019m strong and confident and like I\u2019m everything they want to be when In reality I\u2019m the weakest person I know. I completely fold every single time something even remotely inconvenient happens. I\u2019m so weak. I wish someone would love me for me. Would love the real me that cares about everyone I see. The one who wants to be good. I\u2019m a big heaping pile of manipulative shit. I either want a big loving warm hug or a shotgun in my mouth. I can\u2019t think of which one would be easier to get.
