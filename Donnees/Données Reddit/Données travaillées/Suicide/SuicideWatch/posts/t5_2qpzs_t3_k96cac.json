I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be sad if I was gone, but I want them to be here for me now! \n\nI live in a toxic and abusive household that I can\u2019t leave until next year. I was hoping that with lockdown being eased slightly, I\u2019d be able to get out more and see people in order to cope. But the people I want to see don\u2019t want to see me. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done wrong, I thought they cared but I guess I was wrong. \n\nThe worst part is that I\u2019ve been there for them, but now that I need it they don\u2019t care. They\u2019re too busy or literally don\u2019t give a fuck about me. I posted here yesterday, and then afterwards I went and tried to reach out to people and was ignored. It\u2019s only December and I know from experience it gets a lot worse than this over winter because of my family. I\u2019m really not gonna make it this time, and the sad thing is that this year has been the best year of my life even despite corona.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k96cac/i_reached_out_and_no_one_cares/", "title": "I reached out and no one cares", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MagpieMelon", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 46, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607441803, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k96cac/i_reached_out_and_no_one_cares/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426412.4150844, "replies_charged": false}
