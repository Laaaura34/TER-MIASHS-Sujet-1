Well, I want to reassure you that this is not only what I wanted, but what\u2019s best for everyone. Trust me when I say I\u2019ve tried for more than a decade to cope with my thoughts and feelings; to cope with being me. My brushes with self harm and suicide in 2019 weren\u2019t just a fluke or a misstep in my life, but a culmination of my life so far and a sign that I not only was mentally and emotionally unwell, but was getting worse with every year. In fact, 13 marked the first time I felt existential dread and major depression (and keep in mind this was months before mom and dad got divorced). I had moments of false hope that things would get better, that if I just played along with therapy and medication that I would magically feel better and become the stable adult that you all hoped I would be. I\u2019ve never been able to live up to my two older brothers. I went to university and failed so fucking miserably (not to mention all the student debt I acquired because I was too dumb/unmotivated in high school to get a full ride). What few friends I was able to make with my piss poor social skills left me anyway as soon as I showed signs of struggling (except Andy, whom I will always love and appreciate everything he did for me even though I didn\u2019t deserve it).\n\nTo be honest I had high hopes for 2020 at the beginning of the year. I felt I was turning my life around and ready to make a real difference in the world with my EMT certification. Ever since June of last year I legitimately struggle to feel okay with myself and my past actions along with my entire world view being flipped on its head. I legitimately don\u2019t know if it\u2019s okay to associate with anyone who\u2019s ever had anything to do with law enforcement (I\u2019m sorry *stepdad who makes my mom very happy*, virtually all social media from high school friends and most every musician/actor I respect has irreversibly fucked my brain up because I can\u2019t reconcile with the events of the past year). Only about a year ago was I diagnosed with OCD and I legitimately can\u2019t tell if the racist, transphobic, and sexual thoughts of underage teenagers are my own or my OCD just destroying me. I want to say these aren\u2019t representative of me, but they originate from my brain and I\u2019m so fucking scared every day that I\u2019m a monster. It all started with me sexualizing an old picture of someone I knew from high school where I wasn\u2019t sure if they were 18 or 17 in it and feeling absolutely gross when I learned for sure they were 17. The rest of the fucking awful thoughts came flooding in after this incident and I can\u2019t feel morally okay with myself. I really and truly believe these factors are enough for me to deserve to die. I can\u2019t risk this being the real me and being a fucking disgrace/monster.\n\nThis is all not to mention I fucking suck at my new patient care job that I got from my EMT cert. I keep fucking up after weeks of on the job training and I\u2019m afraid that my mistakes will legitimately hurt someone trying to heal from an injury. This is why I made my decision to end it all. I\u2019m so so so sorry everyone. I love you all, but I\u2019m sure you and the world as a whole is better off without me walking around.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbfq5w/i_think_this_will_be_my_suicide_note_names/", "title": "I think this will be my suicide note (names changed or removed)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AltUser2021", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634662639, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbfq5w/i_think_this_will_be_my_suicide_note_names/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635427979.4550834, "replies_charged": false}
