I try to reach out but they don't want it. I've graduated, but I didn't really have any friends in school either. Nobody owes someone a friendship or love etc, but it still feels shitty when you can't get anything. \n\n I've been thinking a lot about just leaving all this shit to start a new life (basically leave everything, every trace of me. Go missing) or just end it all. I just have a hard time deciding how to leave this fucking hell. I never asked for this, and now I suddenly have to be in debt to survive and shit. I didn't ask for this and then it's taboo to say that you didn't want it. Why tf didn't my mom just abort me.\n\nIve done an experiment where I try not to be active online at all to see if anyone reaches out to me for a change. Nada. Nothing. So that's the proof. Nobody cares, I really won't be missed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/heo8ya/i_wont_be_missed/", "title": "I won't be missed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "saltysodiumchloride", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1592950244, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/heo8ya/i_wont_be_missed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428496.5823987, "replies_charged": false}
