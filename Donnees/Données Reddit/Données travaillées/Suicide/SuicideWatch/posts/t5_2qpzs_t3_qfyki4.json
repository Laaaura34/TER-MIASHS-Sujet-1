But one my mom stabbed me in the right eye blinding me forever before killing herself in front of me, after that my dad gets drunk and beats me even harder. Then one day my brother the only one I trust got kidnapped and died then after I got kidnapped but my dad got me out and the kidnappers got the thing they deserve but my dad still beats me and then he died. I never went to school because a lot of people hate my parents and even walking in the street can be dangerous for me so I never talked to anyone my age. I\u2019ve been self taught since I was born. When my dad died I stayed at home alone for 3 months until someone found me then I was sent to an orphanage but because I was missing an eye and never talked to people my age I got beaten in the orphanage too then some parents took me but they mistreated me but this time the police found out and I was sent to other parents. I also tried suicide but it didn\u2019t work. Now I live with a very big PTSD and do not want to live", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfyki4/i_wanna_try_again_tomorrow/", "title": "I wanna try again tomorrow", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BURNERACCOUNT-Burner", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635222455, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfyki4/i_wanna_try_again_tomorrow/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425570.1493602, "replies_charged": false}
