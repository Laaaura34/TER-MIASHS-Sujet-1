I keep messing up the bathroom with my stupid vomiting, despite cleaning it as much as I could. I have Bulimia. And it bothers everyone here. I have suicidal tendencies. It scares my friends. I\u2019m on edge, I was close to going through with an attempt multiple recently. I scare everyone. I think i\u2019m in love, but is it really love if he probably doesn\u2019t feel the same anymore?\n\nI\u2019m sick. Sick of myself. I feel physically ill alot now. My health isn\u2019t good. And I hate that. I feel like a soul sucking monster. I can pretend to be getting better. But I get set off by my step dad berating me, then bringing up about how much of a burden I am for my purging. It\u2019s funny. No one wants to get me help here. But I can\u2019t blame them. That\u2019s time wasted. That\u2019s hours in something I\u2019m stuck with. Every therapist dropped me due to liability issues. Who says this won\u2019t just be the same? I\u2019m sick of me.\n\nI\u2019m sick of being mentally ill, and a failure,an embarrassment, disgusting. I can\u2019t find my knife. But I want it. I hope I could find it tonight.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qab0is/i_am_a_burden/", "title": "I am a burden", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Individual_Client_33", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634515620, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qab0is/i_am_a_burden/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422922.0800254, "replies_charged": false}
