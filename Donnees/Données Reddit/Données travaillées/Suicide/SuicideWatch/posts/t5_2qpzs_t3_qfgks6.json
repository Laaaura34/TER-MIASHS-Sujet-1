I think about suicide daily. My doctor thinks I'm bipolar but hasn't decided between 1 and 2 yet. I either feel intense anxiety pretty much all the time or super depressed. There really isn't much in between. Maybe a day or 2 in between that are good days, but it's hard to remember them when you feel this way all the time. It's not that I wanna go through with it. I just can't stop thinking about it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfgks6/suicidal_ideation/", "title": "Suicidal ideation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tynaashwipe", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635167960, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfgks6/suicidal_ideation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427198.66328, "replies_charged": false}
