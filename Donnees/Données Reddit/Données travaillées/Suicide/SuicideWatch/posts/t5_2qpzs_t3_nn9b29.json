I\u2019m thinking of drinking some rubbing alcohol and/or mouthwash so I can lower my inhibitions enough so as to drink the rest of it, 50 advils, 20 bupropions, 20 lexapros for more fun, a few tide pods, and loads of energy drinks so I can bring myself to break through my dorm window and belly flop on the concrete as my body bleeds from the inside and out. \n\nI wish there was a cleaner way, but I have no firearm.\n\nI don\u2019t care about anybody, nobody ever cared for me in the end anyway.
