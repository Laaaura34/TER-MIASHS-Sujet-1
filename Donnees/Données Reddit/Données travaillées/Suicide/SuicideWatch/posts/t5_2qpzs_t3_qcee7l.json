When we moved away from all of my family when i was 5, I felt like dying but wasn\u2019t sure what to call it. My first attempt was at age 12. My mom lied to me about who my dad was, and told me he had died by hanging. This absolutely broke me, my \u201cdad\u201d that i\u2019ve known became a stranger in a way. Since then i\u2019ve lost track of the amount of attempts, blurring so many together. After rape, abuse, neglect that\u2019s all that\u2019s ever in my mind still at 19. Today, i had thoughts of grabbing a rope and walking to the woods. The only reason i didn\u2019t is because my boyfriend had picked me up from work and we live together, so i can\u2019t necessarily \u201cget away\u201d without him being suspicious since he knows my past. I\u2019m such a broken person, i need help and reassurance. It\u2019s my boyfriend and I alone in this world with no other support in the world. I love him, and i know i\u2019m his biggest support and his everything so i can\u2019t do that to him. But i don\u2019t want to live.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qcee7l/ive_been_suicidal_since_the_age_of_6/", "title": "I\u2019ve been suicidal since the age of 6", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "brunette-barbie_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634773848, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qcee7l/ive_been_suicidal_since_the_age_of_6/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428277.0118906, "replies_charged": false}
