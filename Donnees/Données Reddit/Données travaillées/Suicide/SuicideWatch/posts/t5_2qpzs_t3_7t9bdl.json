I turn 24 this year and I feel so bitter and resentful. Most people it seems have been having sex and/or loving relationships for a decade now and I feel so envious. I mean Im happy for my friends that are in these good relationships but I'm upset becasue Ive never experienced one myself. I just wish I knew what was wrong with me. The girls I get close to tell me how nice I am and that Im not ugly but the only girls I find that I really like are already taken!\nEven if I found a girlfriend past 24 I would ALWAYS have the feeling that I've missed something important before. What it does when you experiment love while being young. I will forever be an orphan of those adolescent loves I have not known. You know, this innocent, rather carefree love, without the obligations of the adult life. And I wouldn't endure this. I already can't stand my current situation.\nAnd I lost something like 7 years, during which I could have known young adult love, just her and me, leaving me with just 5 potential years of it, before women start to go out with me wanting marriage and children. I turn 24 in September\nLast year I made a kind of suicide pact with myself saying if I didn't find someone in a year Id kill myself and a years gone by, Im too scared to actually do anything but I still feel horribly depressed. \nEspecially with fucking valentine's day coming up. Any of the girls Ive liked in the past have all been taken. I dont know how to talk about this with anyone in my life. Anyone I try to explain this too doesn't take me seriously and treats me like Im immature and my thoughts arent important. I think that the suicidal thought are stronger than other years, and getting stronger and stronger from now on.I really need someone to talk to about this. Because I really feel bad, I am done with never having a girlfriend, and having such a delay in romantic relationships.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7t9bdl/23m_sick_of_being_always_alone_and_unloved/", "title": "23M sick of being always alone and unloved", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Monstinn94", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1517016089, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7t9bdl/23m_sick_of_being_always_alone_and_unloved/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427732.2284677, "replies_charged": false}
