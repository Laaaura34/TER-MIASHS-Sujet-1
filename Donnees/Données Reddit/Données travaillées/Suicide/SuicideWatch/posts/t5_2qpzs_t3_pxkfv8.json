My job had some layoffs couple months ago and there are rumors of more down the road. Couple months ago found out my wife was having an affair. Ever since I found out I can't concentrate at work or make myself do any real work. This adds more stress because I'm not preforming. I have been working from home ever since covid so I'm alone all day with my thoughts. Some days I think about taking my gun and walking into the woods and killing myself. Just to end all the pressure and worry. The only thing that stops those thoughts is my kids. I don't want to traumatise them. I don't like telling my wife about it because she feels guilty and blames herself because of her affair. I don't have the emotional energy to reassure her when I feel like that.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pxkfv8/stress_or_depression_or_both/", "title": "Stress or depression or both", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "brokenhusband8644", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632877628, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pxkfv8/stress_or_depression_or_both/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422904.1594493, "replies_charged": false}
