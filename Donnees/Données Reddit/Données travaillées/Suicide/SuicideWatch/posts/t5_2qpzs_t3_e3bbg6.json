It usually starts when I\u2019m up late (due to my anxiety) and I start to think about my financial situation. I\u2019m by no means in trouble. I\u2019ve got stable income, I can pay my bills, maybe save a little, and sometimes I get in trouble but I always pull through. \n\nI\u2019ve got a great husband and he\u2019s the most enriching part of my life. It\u2019s so fun when we\u2019re together. He\u2019s a person who knows my brain and my soul so well. \n\nMy family is great. I have wonderful relationships with them and with my in laws. They\u2019re all accepting and supportive of whatever we may go through. \n\nThat\u2019s where I get stuck. I have these nights like tonight where I start to think: but what else is there? I have to somehow make a big enough impact on this world for some reason until I\u2019m old enough to sit and enjoy old age in retirement. Then I just die? Maybe if I have children I can enjoy watching them grow and have children of their own. But it\u2019s just so pointless-seeming if we know it\u2019s all going to end someday anyway. \n\nWhy stick around and play this game of making money and pretending that jobs are supposed to give us some kind of \u201cpurpose\u201d in life. I don\u2019t like thinking that my purpose is to give massage. I love what I do and it makes me feel good knowing that I\u2019m helping someone in pain, but what else? I\u2019m just on Earth to be in a loving relationship, make people feel good through massage, have kids, and die? It just seems like I\u2019m missing some major point that everyone else either all gets or don\u2019t even see. \n\nI\u2019ve tried ACT therapy which focuses on living a life of values rather than goals. IE: choosing to be a loving partner everyday instead of a goal of getting married and doing things that couples do just because. \n\nWhen I focus on that and live my life through my values of being a good wife, daughter, sister, and massage therapist, I feel really good and everything is peaceful. But is there no final boss battle? It\u2019s just some crazy ride we\u2019re trying to maneuver? Humanity is so clunky and it just seems so silly that everyone falls for this trick of \u201cgetting money so you\u2019re successful\u201d. So what if you\u2019re successful? You can\u2019t take it with you when you die!\n\nTLDR I\u2019m looking for commiseration about how much of a phony and random shit show life is like.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e3bbg6/what_is_the_reason_for_all_of_this/", "title": "What is the reason for all of this?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Kayteal93", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1575011255, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e3bbg6/what_is_the_reason_for_all_of_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425160.9526305, "replies_charged": false}
