(pathetic, I know) While underwater, mybonly thoughts were, \"I still have a lot of anime I haven't watched, I can't die\".\n\nSo I just went ahead and cried. It sucks to feel lkke wanting to die but afraid of death. Is that even a thing. At least now I know that I'm never gonna go through with actually killing myself because I'm afraid. I'm only 21, physically young and healthy but sometimes, I feel like there's nothing more in the future for me.\n\nWhat bothers me was that, I wasn't even thinking about my dreams at that moment anymore. I've forgotten that I'm such an ambitious woman.\n\nAnyway, I think this is just a phase but it just got a little worse today. Maybe this was just my period hormones talking(im due next week), but I have never thought of self harm before and now I did it. I made an arrow cut on my arm using a blade.
