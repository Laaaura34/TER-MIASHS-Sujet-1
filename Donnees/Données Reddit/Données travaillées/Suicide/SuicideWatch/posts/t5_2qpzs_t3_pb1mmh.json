The one person in my family who has showed me nothing but compassion and love my whole life. The one slightly good thing to come out of it is that he won\u2019t have to be inconvenienced by my death which I will probably do shortly after he passes. Im so glad that he doesn\u2019t know of the pain I\u2019m going through as I know he would be heart broken. I really really hope covid doesn\u2019t take him out as it did my neighbors grandparents. \nI know my situation is not nearly as bad as some such as the people over in Afghanistan or the homeless in my country and it makes me so angry that I feel this way when I know I shouldn\u2019t. I just wish suicide wasn\u2019t viewed as such a bad thing.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pb1mmh/life_is_a_horrible_and_cruel_joke_of_suffering/", "title": "Life is a horrible and cruel joke of suffering and pain", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NefariousnessLow8078", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629856935, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pb1mmh/life_is_a_horrible_and_cruel_joke_of_suffering/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423013.4365058, "replies_charged": false}
