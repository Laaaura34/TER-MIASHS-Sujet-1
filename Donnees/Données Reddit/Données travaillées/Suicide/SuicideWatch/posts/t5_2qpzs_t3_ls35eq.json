Now I will let you with my backstory, bear with me because the story will be long (the first parts will not talk about my suicidal thoughts but these parts are important to understand me and how I feel if you wanna skip these go to part 5 but it will be harder to understand me).\n\nI (21M) am struggling with suicidal thoughts for about 10 years, I have had some up and down\u2019s. I need help.\n\nPart 1: The bullying\n\nWhen I was 9 years old I started to get bullied because I was fat. Not that fat at that time in fact I was not even overweight but yeah I started to get bullied about that, later I gained a lot of weight I will talk more about my weight during the whole story because this is one of the biggest problems I have. The bullying only got worse with time until I reached the age of the 13, I was bullied at school and scouts. This went too far one day at scouts and I left, for school the bullying stopped kinda miraculously (probably because I was back at a normal weight, I was overweight between 10 and 13). After that I was done with bullying I sometimes had some people mocking me but honestly it was really not malicious even though it hurt a lot.\n\nPart 2: The asshole\n\nEven though I only realized this after a long time at 14 I became a real asshole. The victim became the abuser and I started mocking 2 boys at my school for their weight. For more than 1 year I became a bully, not a big one it was \u00ab only\u00a0\u00bb the occasional remark. At that time I didn\u2019t know why I felt good about that but today I know. I could not stand the fact that guys who were more overweight than me could be happy while I felt so bad because of my weight. Little did I know at the the time those 2 guys were suffering at least as much as I was. Both of these guys were my friends originally. What I said was said in a funny way and at the beginning they even laughed but I said that to hurt them not to make them laugh (didn\u2019t realize it back then). With time I became worse, it became more regular and my words were meaner.\nAt 15 one day one on these a guys got our entire friend group minus one to abandon me. The words my victim said to me that day I will remember them for the rest of my life: \u00ab\u00a0The only thing you are useful for in this group is hurting others\u00a0\u00bb.\nThat day I finally saw what I had done, I has become like my bullies I hated so much, and I went through a really hard time (will talk about that in part 3 and 5 because it is linked to these subjects).\nIn the end a few months later at the age of 16 I apologized to both of them and they both forgave me, one of them even tried to become my friend again (the same one who excluded me) but I felt too guilty and decided to keep my distances with them. After that our relationships were cordial, we never were friends again but talked occasionally and even shared some really good moments throughout the next years. Today I forgave myself but I will always regret what I did at that time.\n\nPart 3: My parents the downfall\n\nFrom what I can remember my parents started fighting regularly when I was 11. These fights become more and more frequent until the age of 15 where  my parents separated because my mom met someone else. This happened 2 weeks before I was excluded from my friend group. Because of that I was really angry at my mom even though my father had it coming, he was and still is somewhat abusive sometimes. The fact is my father has big short term memory problems because of a brain illness he got a few years before I was born, to be honest I have never seen him work because he is invalid (not sure about that word though I translated it from invalide in French) which is somewhat of middle ground between a healthy person and a disabled one (he got a lot of money with that status because he had a really good job before his health problems). I know his behavior is bad but it is hard to put the blame on him because what happens is this: He says something really hurtful and mean when something does not go his way, a few hours later he has forgotten the incident. Then a few days later something does not go his way and he will say the exact same thing and it repeats. Most of the time what he does is throwing back at you the biggest mistakes you have done again and again and again (there are about 3 sentences that he regularly says to me, each time he says one of them it feels like he hits me with a hammer).\nLike I said my mom met someone well in fact that someone was not real, my mom was the victim of an emotional scam. She lost a lot of money and tried to kill herself using drugs (she is a doctor) but she called her therapist after she took the drugs who called an ambulance and my mom was saved. Physically she was fine but mentally she was destroyed.\nAfter that started the worse years of my mom\u2019s life started. My parents got back together and my father kept saying to my mom how stupid she was for getting scammed. Each time he said that my mom started crying, when that happened every time I thought about beating the crap out of him but I never did.\nMy mom was diagnosed with depression and over the course of 3 years spend more than 1 year at the hospital through periods of 2 months because of her mental health.\nDuring that time my parents fought constantly and every time they did I would just runaway in my room and start crying.\n\nPart 4: My parents horrible events but for the best\n\nWhen I was 17 two major events happened to my dad, both of those were horrible  but surprisingly the consequences were excellent. Firstly he too tried to kill himself and failed, he jumped of bridge to land in water that arrived at his hips, so no real danger there. He got a few bruises but besides that he was fine. He was seen by 2 police agents who brought at the hospital. He was diagnosed with depression, major depression maybe even worse than my mom and his therapist thought he had been depressive for a very long time. With that event my dad started taking medication and he became happier and his abusive behaviors almost disappeared. His relationship with my mom and with me improved a lot, and this was the start of the best period I lived in the last ten years.\nThe second event that happened was an accident, my dad cut 4 of his fingers off. He went to hospital to be treated, sadly none of his fingers could be reattached, and when he came back home it took months for him to get his normal abilities back. During that time he needed me and my mom to help him a lot and he became so nice during that period. He was back to the dad I had when I was a child a loving, caring and great father.\nThe benefits of this period stayed for more than two years, probably the happiest years of my life after the age of eleven.\nFrom last year on my dad has been coming back too a part of his abusive behaviors but most of the time he was really nice. But he is becoming worse and I am afraid he won\u2019t stop. He stopped tacking medication for his depression while he still needs them which is the real problem with him, he still is way better than when I was 15 or 16.\nMy mom is doing better she still is depressed and takes medication for it but she has not gone back to the hospital since I was 18 and she genuinely seems to go better, honestly even though at some point my mom had the worse mental health between the 3 of us now she has the best.\n\nPart 5 (final): Me and my suicidal thoughts\n\nLike I before I started to be bullied at the age of 9, at the time it was only at scouts so I just went there once a week and it didn\u2019t happen too often. I was still a happy child at that time.\nAt the age of 11 after I confessed my love to a girl in my class people started to bully me there too and that is the time where I thought about killing myself for the first time. I felt bad and I hated my body and progressively started to hate myself. But still I maybe thought about killing myself.\nThankfully at 12 it was the end of primary school and I thought it was a fresh start because no students of my primary school would go to the same Mh school I went (in my country we don\u2019t have a distinction between middle and high school so I decided to call it Mh school) to. Big mistake because I got bullied there too I started really thinking about killing myself at that time and I wrote a suicide letter for the first time, I put it on the table in the living room before getting out of the house. I had decided to do it but at the last moment I thought about my parents, how sad they would be how they would separate if I died (my parents separating scared me a lot at that time). So I went back to my house where I found my dad looking for me and my mom crying in the living room. I had to reassure her, I told her that everything was fine that I wouldn\u2019t kill myself and that I felt good. It was a lie, obviously, but my parents believed me so they did nothing.\nAt the age of 13 I quit scouts after a really horrible day and the bullying at my school stopped alone. But I was feeling even worse than at twelve I felt like a huge pile of garbage. I started to think about killing myself very regularly at that time and almost did it 3 times. The positive point was that I became way taller that and my weight almost didn\u2019t move so I went from overweight to normal.\nAt the ages of 14 and 15 (before my parents separated) I still felt bad about my body even though I was not overweight anymore. And seeing larger people than me happy enraged me so I started to hurt them and this made me feel way better because I finally felt there was some justice (in my stupid way of thinking a the time). I still thought about killing myself every now and then but it was better than before.\nAt the ages of 16 and early 17 I felt horrible, at that time I started to stay in my room and never leave it except for eating. And even then I often times didn\u2019t eat with my parents and just grabbed some food in the kitchen to eat in my room. The only comfort I could find was in food so I started to gain weight. And this made me feel even worse, I thought about killing myself more and more often, I can not remember the amount of times were I almost did it, but each and every time I was about to do it I saw the image of my parents. I saw them both crying, suffering a lot and in the end killing themselves. Terrified by how much I would hurt them I refrained from ending everything. Once again at that time I tried to tell my parents how bad I felt and once again when I did I had to reassure them both because they reacted in a terrible way, so I minimized my feelings.\nAt the ages of 17 (after my dad\u2019s suicide attempt) and 18 (before going to college) things improved a lot between my parents and the situation at home started to change. I fought less and less with my father and my mother started to be more happy. I had forgiven myself for bullying my former friends. Physically I also felt better, I lost weight and came back to a normal one. This time was the best period throughout those last 10 years, I had hope for the future and I only thought about killing myself once during that entire period: On Valentine\u2019s Day. I have always felt terrible that day. Seeing so many people celebrating love when I felt that no one would ever love me was hard (I will develop more about that later). If that period had just been a few months longer I would not need to post here. I think I would have been able to put an end on these suicidal thoughts.\nWhen I started college I was incredibly motivated, I wanted to change my life and I wanted to make lots of friends and I thought I would finally find a girlfriend. So I made 1 mistake. I don\u2019t know if it is the same thing in the US but in my country there is a two week period at the beginning of college (in some faculties, not all) where students who want it can make friends with many different people in different years and they can get integrated. It is not mandatory do this period to integrate among people who did it but is the easiest and fastest way. This 2 week period is in the same idea as military classes (although way softer), it is a mix of constant humiliation, being always screamed at and some fun activities, being all together in that mess helps the first years to get a lot closer.\nI thought I could withstand that but I was wrong after 3 days I gave up. Being constantly screamed at and humiliated hurt me so much and made me remember the period where I was bullied. It took me more than 3 months to recover (and not even fully) from the wounds that were reopened. So I completely failed my January exams, my parents then started to put way to much pressure onto me because of that. My relationship with my father started to degrade and then I progressively felt worse and  worse. I started to gain weight again. Everything was going downwards so much so that at 19 I felt even worse than at 16. After miserably failing my first year twice in engineering studies, I went to on other faculty of the same college at 20.\nI started to study math, and well it went better for a time, I passed all my exams at the first try without too much effort because I felt better. The reason why I felt better was simple but completely stupid, I just rejected my bad feelings and thoughts, I lied to myself pretending there was no problem and it worked for some time. But keeping everything inside was not possible and one day in July of last year I went in my bed and I started to cry uncontrollably and sobbing (I had not sobbed while crying since I was 12) for hours. Nothing special happened that day, it just was the day where I could not ignore my problems anymore, it just was the day where the box inside of my head where I put my bad feelings exploded.\nThis leads me to how I feel today, after the \u00ab\u00a0explosion day\u00a0\u00bb my mental health declined slowly but steadily. I feel so bad now that honestly if I could talk with my 16 years old self I would just laugh at him for acting like that when he still had so many good things that happened to him. I put more and more weight on and now I am obese. I stopped doing sports and I just hang around playing video games and watching videos on YouTube all day long because if I stop the only thing I think about is killing myself. I live in a small appartement my father bought for me close to my college (I go back home all weekends) and it\u2019s a mess, I stopped cleaning it and it\u2019s disgusting. There is trash everywhere and I have not done the dishes in two months (I just clean a fork and a knife regularly to use them). I eat almost exclusively junk food. I feel like I am just a nuisance for this world. I used to shower every day sometimes even twice a day when I had sports now I at most wash myself twice a week. Every day it\u2019s a fight inside of my head between 2 voices with the first one saying \u00ab\u00a0Get up, go wash yourself, clean that mess, start studying, get back in shape, if you try things you will end up getting better. \u00bb and the second one saying \u00ab\u00a0All the efforts you make are useless, so just give up and enjoy the last weeks of your life playing games and when you can\u2019t withstand your life anymore, end yourself\u00a0\u00bb. The first one keeps getting weaker and the second one stronger. I am constantly thinking about putting an end to everything. I feel like the biggest garbage pile in the world.\nI tried one final time to alert my parents, I told them I was always thinking about killing myself. And for the third time they reacted terribly and I had to lie again and do as if it was just a few bad days.\nI said I would talk more about the fact I think that no one will ever love me now it is time. I never had a girlfriend, I have had several girl friends (with most of them I just wanted to be friends so don\u2019t see me as has someone who just gets friendly with a girl in the hope of becoming a couple) throughout the years, one of witch I loved, but nothing more. I tried many times to get close to different girls I was attracted to and every single time once I made my intentions clear I was rejected. Two girls confessed love to me and both times they lied, the first one was the girl I loved and confessed to in primary school and the second one was a friend who I had no feelings for. I played it off as it was nothing but it hurt me so much. I feel so ugly, I know physique isn\u2019t everything but to see my hart you have to go through so many ugly layers. And at 18 a few days before my January examens at college I started doing something incredibly stupid, I started seeing escorts. My first experience was a disaster and the day I went to see her still is the worse of my life. But a few months later I went to see another one, it was better but still bad. And after that I kept doing it seeing a different one every single time, and every time it was bad. Until last year in June where I finally had a good experience, thanks to her I realized why I kept doing it even though it was was bad every single time. I didn\u2019t go to escorts to have intercourse, I went to them to talk with someone who would listen, someone who would hug me in a lovely and caring way. Someone who would whisper nice things to me. And that last one was the only one who did that I feel like she knew what I wanted even though I didn\u2019t know it myself. I spend the whole night with her and we barely had intercourse and spend such a long time cuddling, hugging and talking about ourselves. I felt so good when she left. But having realized what I was seeking, I stopped seeing escorts because I knew that it would be useless.\n\nSo this is where I am now. Every single time I see a train I think about jumping in front of it, every day I am on the verge of ending it. I feel like my life is just a long agony. If nothing changes I will probably end up killing myself in the next month.\n\nSo Reddit if even a single one of you can help me it could save me. I want to be able to tell my parents how I am feeling, I want to able to go see a psychiatrist (I tried several time calling one but I just can\u2019t dial the last number).
