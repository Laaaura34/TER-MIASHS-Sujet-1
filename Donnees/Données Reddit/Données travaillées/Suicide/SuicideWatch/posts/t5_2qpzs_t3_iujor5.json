My cat lightly steps on my leg and it makes me tick really hard and makes my heart feel like it's going to explode from anxiety. Its so bad that it shoots even more pain down my back and left arm.\n\nI cant go to the mental health hospital because of how traumatizing my 5 day stay was. My wife held me then. She told me everything was going to be okay and I wouldn't have to go back. They need to give me a feeding tube and pain meds and just let me go as fast as possible. Additionally I cant afford to even miss 1 day of work. They keep you there so long.\n\nIm autistic, have PTSDC, major depression, and an anxiety disorder; this cant really be how life is for everyone, right?
