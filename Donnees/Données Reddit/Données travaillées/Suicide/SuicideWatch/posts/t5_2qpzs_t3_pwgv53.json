All my other friends went to a different school and in the two years I\u2019ve been here, I haven\u2019t been able to make any sort of connections with people. Anxiety partially inhibits me doing so. \n\nThere was this guy that I broke up with over quarantine because we were going to different schools and I didn\u2019t think it would work. That was the worst decision of my life. \nWe\u2019re still basically best friends. We come to each other with everything and he lets me vent to him, etc. \n\nA couple weeks ago was when I figured out I was in love with him and I wanted to ask him if we could get back together. I found out through his friend that he was in love with someone else. \n\nThey\u2019re happily together, but I can\u2019t stand that thought. He\u2019s been getting more distant from me. \n\nI will not try and break them up or get between them; I\u2019m not that kind of person. But I\u2019ve been getting physically sick over losing him. I haven\u2019t been able to eat or sleep (I haven\u2019t eaten a solid meal in six days) and I just really want to die because of how alone I am now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwgv53/i_cant_go_on_without_him/", "title": "I can\u2019t go on without him", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "redhoodies_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632748657, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwgv53/i_cant_go_on_without_him/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426409.346923, "replies_charged": false}
