This time last week I felt the best I have ever felt, now I want it to end. \n\nI won't get into details too much, but long story short, I hurt a lot of women in my life, through unintentional sexual abuse, be it physical or mental. \nI am a recovering sex addict. \n\nI am ashamed of this, truly. \nI have depression, take meds, live alone and have bettered myself over the last few years, but my closest (female) friends had a group chat together about my actions from years past. They decided to write me a long message explaining their feelings of mistrust and uncomfortableness. \nThey said never to contact them again. \nThey were my anchors. \n\nI thought I was better. \nThis was on Monday, and since then suicide seems like the best option. \nI want to move forward in my life, I understand I made mistakes but I have moved past my toxic lifestyle. \nSadly I cannot fix my mistakes. \n\nHow does someone with now no friends, a stressful masculine job and overly proud parents who don't know my feelings live a happy life?\n\nI want to erase myself and vanish.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n6s6i0/living_with_guilt_and_shame/", "title": "Living with guilt and shame.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "woodenheart94", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620369302, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n6s6i0/living_with_guilt_and_shame/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423037.2940943, "replies_charged": false}
