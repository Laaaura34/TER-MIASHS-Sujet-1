And now I'm starting to understand why. I don't want to be friends with you anymore, either, because I'm getting really annoyed by it too. It's more work trying to be friends with you.\"\n\n\"Oh. Ok.\" \\(I tried to hide it, my face turned red and she could tell I was about to cry.\\) \n\n\"I wish \\[redacted\\] could have seen your face just now. You looked really pathetic.\" \n\n\"I know.\" \n\n\\-\\-\\-\\- \n\nI've spent nearly the entirety of my short life trying to work through unprocessed trauma, developmental issues, anxiety, etc. I only officially started seeing a psychiatrist half a year after I turned 17, and even then it took awhile to find the appropriate medication. I've been suicidal since I was twelve, and it's only been getting worse. This past year I found out I have a CTE \\(Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy\\), aka \"punch drunk disease\" or \"that thing that retired NFL players have\". This was after I found out I have ASPD \\(Antisocial Personality Disorder\\). CTEs and mild traumatic brain injuries have been found to impair inhibitions & empathy in the long run, contributing to sociopathic behavior.\n\nI lied, and told people that I would be fine following the incident, and I would be \"stronger\". That it would be easier for me to let go because I'm just so tired of things, and I just want to move on. But I was just sweeping things under the rug, as usual. It's so much easier said than done to \"just move on\". That, and she was purportedly \"worried\" about me wanting to kill myself... I'm sure she just wanted to make sure that I did. I \\*know\\* that's all she wanted to know.\n\nSo, I have no hope. I have no value or worth to society. I'm a bottom feeder, and as I deteriorate I will unnecessarily suck up society's resources more and more. I should have just done it earlier. My time here on this fucked up planet was a waste. I held on foolishly thinking things would get better, but they only get worse no matter what I do or try.
