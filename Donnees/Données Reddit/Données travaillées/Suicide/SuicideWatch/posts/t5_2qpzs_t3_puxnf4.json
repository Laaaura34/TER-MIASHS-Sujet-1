I made a whole new account under a randomised username that can't track back at all to my true identity, even though i've never used reddit before. I kind of wish someone cared about me enough so i could confide in them but i cant so i guess this is some sort of secret journal that i'll leave behind after i die, maybe someone will gain access to my laptop and find this account and see everything idk. btw none of this is going to make much sense because im not in the mental state to format it properly and im just kind of ranting in the hopes that somebody will give me a reason to live. ***i apologise for shitty grammar and shitty spelling in advance***\n\nim a straight female at the age of 17 nearly 18, i have a boyfriend of just over 2 months, and ive been in 2 previous relationships with 2 guys that treated me like shit. the first one ruined my entire mentality, it lasted about 6 months and i was gaslighted and mentally abused throughout most of the relationship but i never realised because he was my first boyfriend. he would get angry at me for no reason, be mad when i didnt tell him my feelings, and when i did hed get mad that i felt that way. the second guy i guess i didnt date, he was just someone i talked to, the guy i had considered my actual soulmate for the longest time until one day he just decided he didnt have enough time for both me and his friends and left, after about 2 months, a few kisses and a few dates. now. my current or maybe not so current boyfriend. he was the healthiest one out of every boy ive ever talked to, he never got angry when i told him about how i feel, and stayed patient everytime i struggled to open up because of previous trauma. he understood my ptsd from my first boyfriend and never undermined my feelings, hes always been there for me when i cry and feel like dying but recently its been going a bit differently. for the past 3 weeks or so ive been crying almost every day. for 2 weeks straight i cried everyday, for 3 days i didnt cry at all/was on the verge of tears but didnt cry and now here i am, ive been crying for 4 hours straight and all i can think about is paracetamol and alcohol. i dont know what it is that changed, hes used to me crying because each time he would treat me with kindness and treat me in a soft way completely different to my other exes i would burst into tears because of how kind he was to me. am i attached to him? am i in love? \n\nanother point, ive been cutting again since last week after a year break, and my entire left arm is covered in scars again. i told him about some of them but he didnt really care enough to check irl to make sure i havent cut in any other places or make sure that i havent cut because i told him i wouldnt. i get that it sounds selfish of me but he knows i struggle to tell him things and he mentioned wanting to check but he never did i guess. out of every couple i know, my boyfriend and i have met the most often, meeting almost every day in the holidays during the first month or so when we began dating. now that school has started again we havent been able to meet much because my parents are incredibly strict about meeting and he goes to a boarding school about 2 hours away from me during term time. it's hard to meet and when we do its nice of course but somehow i get incredibly happy while im with him and end the day crying somehow. am i bipolar? whats wrong with me? i wish so badly that i could just die, why do i want to die when i have a boyfriend who's so loving?\n\nearlier today he asked me to be more honest with him and tell him about everything that burdens me, even if it hurts him and i mentioned not wanting to have sex everytime i go to his house, although i understand that guys are horny and he suddenly left to 'sleep' without our normal night conversations and long goodnight texts. he says its okay that i feel like that and that he'll take on the blame but fuck i feel so fucking awful because i could just say no couldnt i? why didnt i just tell him all those times that i wasnt in the mood? hes not the type to be mad, he wouldve just stopped and cuddled me or something. after he left and we went to 'sleep' he started to talk about the fact that im bad at making my boyfriends feel special in comparison to my friends. for context, i consider myself to be super friendly because i like making friends and i want people to like me - simply put im a people pleaser. with each boyfriend ive had, they've told me im not very good at making them feel special or loved. with the first one it was my fear of physical contact - prior to dating him i hadnt talked to any guys, let alone TOUCH them and i rarely hugged my own female friends at that point. he begged me to hug him more, hold his hand more, walk close to him more and initiate such things first without him initiating first. this was easier to accommodate after a while, although a bit forced and awkward at first because he rushed me into physical contact i was never used to with anyone, including my own family. at the moment my current boyfriend's main request and concern is that i dont make him feel special in comparison to his friends, i try my best but its not enough for someone like him whos only ever watched romance animes and has the highest standards out of everyone i know. im not even saying thats a bad thing but i wonder why he liked me, knowing i was emotionally incapable of providing such love.\n\nadditional context for you because why not:\n\nme and my current boyfriend met through my first boyfriend, they went to the same school and were ex bffs. i met my second boyfriend while i was still dating the first one, because he went to a different school and one of his new friends happened to like me. he confessed while i was still dating boyfriend 1 and of course i rejected him. after boyfriend 1 broke up with me though boyfriend 2 did his best to cheer me up, we would call everyday and play minecraft together and listen to music, and he would tell me to turn on my camera and spoil me with compliments to raise the self esteem destroyed by my first boyfriend. i wonder why we never officially dated, even when i confessed to him after he told me he still liked me, i guess we were never meant to be, even if we felt perfect together. god that guy, if he didnt shit talk me behind my back after he was too 'tired' to keep talking to me i would probably still be in love with him right now. my current boyfriend saw me through boyfriend 1 and 2, he saw the pain i felt with both and was with me through all of my suicidal and depressive episodes. essentially, he was my best friend. i never thought of him as more than that, but one day he confessed and i didnt know what to do because i genuinely never thought of him in that way. he 'courted' me for about a month before i started liking him back and i asked him out. (fuck thinking about it, i asked out both boyfriend 1 and 2, i just want that romantic asking out god fucking damnit)\n\nbut yeah, im constantly scared he doesnt love me anymore, or that hes getting tired without any real reason because im just fucking traumatised by the past two that i think he might just get sick of me and leave, what makes it worse is the fact that i never really got enough time to get over boyfriend 2 properly before i began dating my current boyfriend.. it doesnt mean i love him any less but as a result im highly emotionally unstable and i cant function anymore. i cant get out of bed most days and i have a 45% attendance at school. i dont have the motivation to live and i dont know why - my boyfriend is amazing and im so lucky to have him but i just dont have the will to live anymore. our recent 'argument' has left me completely drained. its 3:13am as im writing this and i wish the ceiling would fall on me. i met him again today after about 2 weeks of only calls and while i was happy with him, right now i really fucking wish i could die. i wish i could cut until i bleed out and die, i wish i could disappear from this world so bad i cant think of anything else. i feel so selfish but have you ever felt so desperate to die that you simply cant do anything else but sit there and cry, wishing on a god that doesnt exist, disillusioned, just waiting to die.\n\ni dont know what to do anymore, if he leaves ill probably just kill myself there and then, but i kind of wish someone could stop me.\n\noh well reddit, it was fun being here while i was here, i hope you all live the perfect lives youve always dreamed of, i hope you live on for me, i hope you get to make new memories with the person you love the most, i hope you find a reason to keep on living. \n\n:) with love,\n\nanon.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/puxnf4/i_wish_i_could_die/", "title": "i wish i could die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Impossible_Clue6795", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632536265, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/puxnf4/i_wish_i_could_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427652.2407331, "replies_charged": false}
