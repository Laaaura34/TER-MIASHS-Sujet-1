Thinking about it now, it makes me laugh at how incredibly dumb and useless I am. The worst part is the look on my family's face. The look of shame my father has for me. He barely talks to me because I am definitely not the person he thought I would be. \nI've been battling anxiety and depression (and bulimia my entire life) The first time I got myself to college, I quit because I couldn't even attend exams as I couldnt get outside the house. Afterwards I enrolled myself in a college but unfortunately I freezed my last year. Its been two years since then, recently finished my thesis and everything but now im afraid they will expel me. If I cannot complete my bachelor degree I feel that I cannot handle this at all on top of everything else.\nMy bulimia has led to me having constant pain in my stomach area, has given me a reduced amount of foods I can safely eat without feeling bad. I feel like I have damaged my insides as much as my outside. Just feels that I am not enough, I cannot help myself. My life is truly over, there is no energy, no purpose to my distance at all. I am a big nuisance to everyone in my life. It would ve been better if I never got born.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o0htnv/i_cant_deal_with_the_embarrassment_i_feel_im/", "title": "I can't deal with the embarrassment I feel, Im unable to help myself.I'll just end everything.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "QSquidding", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623773052, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o0htnv/i_cant_deal_with_the_embarrassment_i_feel_im/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422927.0932038, "replies_charged": false}
