I get scared when I'm buzzed or drunk that I will accidentally or even on purpose kill myself when, at the end of the day, I don't actually want to kill myself so much as I want to die. I feel the most inclined to self-harm when I'm alone and have had some drinks. (I drink alone pretty much every night.)\n\nMaybe this is all more related than I can realize...? I don't know.
