As pedos and child abusers flourish in places like this, where everything can be blamed on the victims illness.\nGoodbye.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pikyse/i_need_to_sacrifice_myself_for_this_place_to_shut/", "title": "I need to sacrifice myself for this place to shut down", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "M4SlVE", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630874650, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pikyse/i_need_to_sacrifice_myself_for_this_place_to_shut/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428180.2604256, "replies_charged": false}
