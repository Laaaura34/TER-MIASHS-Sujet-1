I do all the prep, take notes, study for crazy amounts, and still fail. \n\nI\u2019m just so tired of letting my loved ones down. They put in so much effort to help and and I try my hardest and it always fails. \n\nI just don\u2019t wanna be the black stain, and I feel like I am taking years off of my parents life with daily stress. \n\nThey even just given up on me sometimes because of how tired they get. \n\n\nIf I end up failing this semester I will probably kill myself. I just don\u2019t know what to do. 4 Years and 80 something credits later, and nothing to show for it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q4uuxi/failure_after_failure/", "title": "Failure After Failure", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Za_Worldo-Experience", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633816204, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q4uuxi/failure_after_failure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426904.6744206, "replies_charged": false}
