Oops.\n\nLiving with my parents, I\u2019m not allowed to get out of bed in the middle of the night (unless I\u2019m using the bathroom), because they fear I\u2019ll hurt myself.\n\nPaired with insomnia, it makes going to bed a living hell;\n\nFan making the room too cold? Freeze, loser.\n\nHungry because you under-eat? You\u2019re gonna have to starve.\n\nWanting a hug because you had a mild panic attack because you\u2019re gonna move to Germany and experience extreme culture-shock? Gonna have to wait a few hours before you can properly tell someone.\n\nExperiencing extreme dread, causing you to want to kill yourself perpetuating the insomnia and giving your parents more reason not to trust you with yourself? Take to the internet.\n\nI hate staying awake at night, and I\u2019m THIS CLOSE to trying to kill myself again, well, if I could find a way. Literally everything I\u2019ve used in the past is locked behind a fingerprint scanner.\n\nI want to run, but I\u2019m not even allowed to walk.\n\nI fear the day they take my phone away from me before bed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hzyc3d/suicidal_on_main_insomnias_a_btch_when_youre/", "title": "Suicidal on main: Insomnia\u2019s a b*tch when you\u2019re forced to stay in bed.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Alternate18472296", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596018410, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hzyc3d/suicidal_on_main_insomnias_a_btch_when_youre/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426538.2733347, "replies_charged": false}
