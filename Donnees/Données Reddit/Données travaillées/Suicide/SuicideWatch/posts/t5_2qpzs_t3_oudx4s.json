Ive been through my own kind of depression from suffering from a traumatic brain injury at 21. But i have healed. \n\nMy boyfriend has been suffering all his life, seeing violence from his parents for the past 20 years towards each other. My boyfriend has been used and betrayed by prior partners and friends so he trusts and relies on no one. Hes distant from his older siblings because they ignored the problems in the household and left elsewhere leaving him with 2 violent parents. He suffers from ptsd, and is constantly annoyed and angry. He hates his family and hates his recently deceased father for all the abuse and drinking his father chose. My boyfriend hates life, does not enjoy it, everyday he suffers gets headaches and gets angry. Everthing irritates him, drivers, ppl, wasps, shopping, summer, cooking, even games. He remembers his past clearly and is in constant pain from grieving his brother. His brother died because his patents are inept at emetional understanding. His brother sought love from women, love he didnt experience at home; same goes for my boyfriend. His brother was the only one who understood what my boyfriend feels. My boyfriend has no motivation, and little things irritates him ruining his whole day. He distracts himself with games and excercise, but is in constant anger.\n\nIve been talking and dating him online for 5 years prior to me living with him. I thought what he needed was a decent partner who would care, comfort, and love him. But that doesnt cure what he feels. His emotions get out of hand becoming irritated, angry, violent and suicidal. I try my best to spend time with him, talk to him, listen, but half the time even me being around irritates him. Its hard seeing him suffer night n day, and it stresses me sometimes into inner tears. \n\nFor me all ive ever been good at is self reflection and studying. I grew up poor but with a good mom. I was doing well at college in engineering prior to my head injury. My emotions and depression solved thmselves with self love and i healed. But he is different, no amount of care or comforting can make him feel better. I cook, clean, massage, coddle, support, and listen to him everyday. But that isnt what he needs. I dont know how to help him. He is also reluctant to apply for health insurance for therapy. I love him, and i want to be useful, i was hoping someone knows what hatred is like. What grief is like, what depression is like. Because i dont understand it. And i was hoping someone would reccomend me literature than can give true therapy for the irritation/ anger he feels. \n\nIt would be upsetting if my post was removed, but thankyou for anyone who comments with book suggestions or has decent advice. At anypoint mine and his live could end tragically, I just want him to be okay even if he doesnt want me anymore. \n\nTl;dr: I need help in supporting my boyfriend mental health;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oudx4s/seeking_advice_or_books_on_managing/", "title": "Seeking advice or books on managing anger/hatred/ptsd/depression.
