This existence was never meant for me, and I think I would've been weeded out by now in a past time but modern life allows me to continue my meandering, pointless life. I had potential. I've gone to college for 3 years now for a degree I no longer care about and I've gotten decent grades but its all for nought because I will not be able to finish this last year. The pointlessness of it all makes it impossible for me to care anymore. I feel as though my life will come to an end sooner rather than later and its only a matter of time.
