I would try to kill myself right now if I was sure It worked. I have literally no reasons to live. I am lonely, I have no friends and I havent a partner because I am ugly as hell (no, I dont have body dysmorphia). Pretty sure I will never find a loving one due to my looks. I have been verbally abused all my life. I suffer from depression and bulimia. Lately they got worse and I started to have throat pain and stomach pain. I dont work right now and I didnt start university because of my mental health problems. I am touch starved and I crave love and affection which I cant have. It's better to die. Depression and bulimia together are unbearable to deal with. It's so exhausting. Plus I dont have anybody to talk to or to go out with. Why the hell should I keep living?
