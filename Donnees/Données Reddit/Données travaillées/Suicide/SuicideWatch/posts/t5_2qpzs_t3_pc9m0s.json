Sometimes I feel like my whole life I've been suffering with only glimpses of light. I logically know that's a matter of perspective and when I stop being so depressed I'll see meaning in more things again because things are always very up and down for me. But now I look at my life and see a void... I feel I've never quite understood what is the point of the material world? Of being born just to inevitably suffer and to cause suffering, of existing just to perpetuate exploitation and to be exploited? And what's the point of having love just to lose it? \n\nIt's probably boring to read but I just want to write out my life story and send it into the void because I'm tired of keeping it all to myself. I know it's a cliche but my whole life I've never been able to shake this sense that my life was suffering, that that suffering was pointless, and therefore my life was pointless; that happiness was fleeting and suffering was the only constant. (Trigger warning for SA here) I was abandoned by my dad at a young age and experienced sexual abuse by a family friend ages 9-12 which has caused me anxiety and issues around sex and trust. I struggled privately with bulimia and depression for the next seven years of my adolescence; growing up I was a quiet, shy, good girl straight A student and had friends but always felt isolated and misunderstood on the deepest level, like no one around me saw the \"real\" me or knew how much pain I was in, and I would fantasize constantly about suicide. My mom was a single mom who worked three jobs, we never had the best relationship but when I was 15 while we were on the verge of eviction she was diagnosed with cancer at which time I had to grow up and take care of her and us. At that point I suppressed everything until I went to college where I completely isolated myself and had a mental breakdown induced by birth control during which I nearly killed myself. In college I basically lost the illusion of control I had over my trauma, started having panic attacks, engaged in risky sex, impulsively got big tattoos that I regret, became heavily reliant on alcohol and weed to self-medicate and would get high or drunk pretty much every night, was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning, started doing harder drugs as well. Two years ago I fell deeply in love with someone who I felt was the only person who ever \"saw\" me and understood me but our relationship was never healthy and he broke up with me abruptly three months ago due partly to being unable to deal with my instability. I didn't hold it against him and at first I kind of suppressed and ignored my feelings about the breakup but recently I've been torturing myself over it and the pain of it feels like the last straw for me because I lost the only person who I felt I could share things with and have realized how alone I am.\n\nI have seen three therapists who never said so much as a helpful word to me and have been on antidepressants which just made me sleep 12+ hours a day. I managed to keep it together academically and graduate with pretty good grades at least and I work a boring 9-5 job now which isn't hard at all but which I still have a hard time doing. My boss has told me she is concerned about my lack of productivity which I don't know how to tell her is due to depression and I am worried I'll be fired in which case I would definitely have to kms since I don't want to move back home. I have zero long term goals, dreams, or career plans and I smoke weed every day which is definitely better than drinking alcohol but which has made me care about nothing and isolate myself completely. I guess everyone can write out all of the worst things that have happened to them and sit around and feel sorry for themselves. I hate myself often for my inability to just get over it. But I have never healed from anything nor do I know if it's possible to at this point. I know logically that there will be beautiful moments in my life if I choose to keep living but it's hard for me to see love or beauty as \"worth\" the suffering that exists in this world. I also feel that my pain has made me a manipulative and needy partner and that I will probably never be healed enough for a truly healthy relationship. The only reason I stay alive is because my suicide would make my mom and my ex feel guilty and I don't want to cause any more suffering in the world. That's literally the only reason and even that one is becoming less and less compelling. I don't really see the point of going forward since I know even true love doesn't last and doesn't really heal. All I want is to sleep forever and to find peace.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pc9m0s/just_want_my_life_to_be_over_so_i_can_sleep/", "title": "Just want my life to be over so I can sleep", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "matcha_666", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630015164, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pc9m0s/just_want_my_life_to_be_over_so_i_can_sleep/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422924.7398868, "replies_charged": false}
