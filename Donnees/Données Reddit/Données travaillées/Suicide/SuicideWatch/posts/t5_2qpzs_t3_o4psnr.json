It\u2019s simply a collection of moments and experiences. If those moments and/or experiences are dull and leave you missing what you\u2019ve never had then i suppose you\u2019re a lot like me. It\u2019s bittersweet. Yes, life can be beautiful, I\u2019ve seen it first hand. My sister(f25), My brother(m18), and I saved a kid(m4) from the icy grips of death, I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty beautiful. I have a wonderfully derpy puppy that I love to death, that\u2019s pretty beautiful too. Cleo, Bella, my friends, my family, it\u2019s all terribly beautiful isn\u2019t it? That does not, however, negate the bad. When I say bad, I don\u2019t really mean bad; I mean the twisted, the insane, the despicable, the horrible, the nightmarish aspects of life, of this existence, of this collection of moments and experiences. My scars, the very scars that I created, that cover my body like some sickly disease that I called upon to haunt me for the rest of my life; that\u2019s bad. My rapists, BAS, those who I trusted with my life, whom I cared and loved for, who betrayed me bitterly without a second though; that\u2019s bad. Anorexia, my ED, the thing that makes me anxious when I see food or even just think about the action of eating, the thing that makes me cry at the mere thought of stuffing that single chip into my mouth; that\u2019s bad. So, life is a collection of moments and experiences. Maybe, the point is to aim for the good, the great, the happy. Maybe that\u2019s all there is to it. Maybe not. Maybe life is just about trying, despite everything it throws at you, to try and never stop trying, even if all you can do is the bare minimum, so long as you try then you\u2019ll always have that. Maybe life has no meaning, and maybe that\u2019s the whole point. Life is what you make of it, after all. You\u2019ll never be able to control others, your surroundings, your situations, none of it. All you can control is yourself. It\u2019s kind of twisted in that sense, isn\u2019t it? You can try all your life, do everything right, but if you\u2019re dealt the wrong cards then their\u2019s very little you can do about it. Maybe I should pray on it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o4psnr/thoughts/", "title": "Thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Faithfulservant12378", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624261057, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o4psnr/thoughts/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635422269.3817298, "replies_charged": false}
