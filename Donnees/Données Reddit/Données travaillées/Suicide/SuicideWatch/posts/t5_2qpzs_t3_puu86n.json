I go to therapy, I take medications.  It doesn\u2019t work.  They tell me to spend $10,000 and 6+ weeks on TMS which has a sub-30% efficacy and when I suggest it isn\u2019t worth the effort then apparently I don\u2019t want to get better.\n\nThe psychiatrist was toxic.  The therapist is toxic.   They can hide their idiocy and cruel behavior behind \u201cchallenging your logic\u201d.   No, when I suggest changing my environment might present a higher reward than going to TMS based on copious personal research, it isn\u2019t \u201clet\u2019s make a plan\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cthat probably won\u2019t work.  You\u2019ll carry your negativity to your new job and it will fail, too.\u201d\n\nFUCK YOU\n\nI\u2019ve spent 18 years suicidal, the past two excruciatingly so.\n\nNow he\u2019s taking the side of my toxic job.  I never had a problem at work and then my past two companies try to do unethical bullshit and throw me under the bus when I push back.  They call me names, kick me off projects.  I\u2019m right - I know I\u2019m right - the research is unequivocal.  They still didn\u2019t fire me.  Why?  Because I\u2019m good at my job.\n\nNow my therapist tells me it\u2019s my fault.\n\nHow the fuck does he know?  These quacks would probably recommend TMS to people going through active abuse/torture and if they declined they\u2019d be told \u201cthey just don\u2019t want to get better\u201d\n\nWhy don\u2019t I get a new job if I\u2019m so right?   It\u2019s complicated for other reasons.  I wanted help charting that course.\n\nUnfortunately, as I get smarter there are fewer and fewer challenges that interest me.  There are fewer and fewer people who can help me get there.\n\nI say things like that and some therapists start thinking \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d.  But no, literally the only thing that has interested me the past 18 years was being right.   Designing and building cutting edge systems.  I have been very successful.  I keep getting stabbed in the back.  Professionally, people see my as a threat. Personally, most people (including my therapist) don\u2019t enjoy being correct.  They enjoy being blissfully stupid.  They enjoy merging into lanes without turn signals, texting and driving, watching Netflix, and being told they\u2019re great even if they\u2019re mediocre.\n\nInstead, my therapist fails to accept that I am seeking fulfillment and success, not happiness.  \u201cNo one on their death bed wishes they spent more time at work\u201d - anecdotal bullshit.   The work I\u2019ve done has saved hundreds of lives.   I told you how toxic my family was, how they threatened to kill me growing up.  My work has brought much more fulfillment and meaning to my life.  And now you\u2019re telling me to stop because I\u2019m wrong?\n\nFucking ridiculous.\n\n\u201cFind another therapist\u201d.  \u201cFind another psychiatrist\u201d.   \u201cBuild a support network\u201d.  \u201cGo to a $500/session out of network psychiatrist\u201d.  \u201cExercise more\u201d.  \u201cImprove your diet\u201d.  \u201cGet a new job\u201d. \u201cDo EMDR\u201d.\n\nDecline any of these due to financial, logistical, or time limitations and \u201cyou don\u2019t want to get better\u201d.   When talking to doctors, failing to do all of these at once is a dealbreaker.  I planned the \u201cperfect routine\u201c to account for all of these things.  It would take me 23.05 hours per day.   I would have to rearrange work schedule to work weekends so I could meet weekday appointments.  I would have 50 minutes free time every day.  If I were slightly dysfunctional, slept in, got put on hold with my insurance company, etc; 50 minutes a day is all the time I\u2019d have left to bleed into.  I\u2019m \n\nFuck this.  I\u2019ve smashed three phones during quarantine.  I punched so many holes in my wall last week my hand was cut up and bleeding.  I had to lie about it at work.  It worked because it\u2019s only the first indication something is wrong with me.\n\nI got a new phone after breaking mine two weeks ago.  Wondered how many calls and messages I missed.   None.   There\u2019s no one left.\n\nPrioritizing my will this month.  Ive procrastinated because I have no one to leave my $500,000 cash or $75,000 personal property to.\n\nAccepting that if there is actually help or good advice out there, I won\u2019t find it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to leave a mess but it\u2019d just be so much logistically easier to end it with my shotgun.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/puu86n/zero_options/", "title": "Zero options", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "EstExecutorThrowaway", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632523217, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/puu86n/zero_options/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425271.1397123, "replies_charged": false}
