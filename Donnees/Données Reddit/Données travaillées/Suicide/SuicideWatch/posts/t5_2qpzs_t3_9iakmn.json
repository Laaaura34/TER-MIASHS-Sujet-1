This is because you are so far into negative thoughts, self image, and self doubt etc. that you fail to believe that even your bestest of friends are really there for you, at least for me that is. I have had many crisis and suicidal ideations, even went to the hospital once for an attempt. I find that in this state I can\u2019t ever make my mind on who to reach out to or call because I\u2019m always telling myself that \u201cI\u2019ll get over it\u201d or that \u201cI\u2019ll waste someone\u2019s time\u201d when I reach out. It is not easy to ask for help in a crisis state and I believe this is why a lot of suicides happen unannounced. I wish the suicide hotline wouldn\u2019t come storming in to your home with a team of police when you mentioned that you want to \u201cend it all\u201d to them. I find that all you need in a crisis moment is just someone to be there for you and take you out of your vortex. They don\u2019t have to fix your problems, just take you out on a car ride or simply hanging out does so many wonders and really saves lives.
