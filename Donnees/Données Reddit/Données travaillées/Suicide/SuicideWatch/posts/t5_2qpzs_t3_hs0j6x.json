He told me that he has had these intrusive thoughts for months and has also been exhibiting severely suicidal behaviors since the quarantine began. The problem has gotten worse as the months have passed to this point where he is putting his mental and physical health, future, and integrity at stake.\n\nA bit of his background comes from abusive parents, depression, rage problems, severe anxiety and is going through a really bad phase rn, and I have no idea how to help him through this since I can't really be close rn if anyone has a similar background of c-PTSD or knows how to help in this situation. He does not have anyone to take him in or a place to go if he is kicked out and in the country, we live in child support is not really the best thing ever, so that is not an option. He is about to commit a really bad decision and if it goes wrong he will probably get kicked out or kill himself before that since his future would be fucked. pls I need help or answers because I\u2019m not very good with this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hs0j6x/a_friend_is_contemplating_the_idea_of_making_a/", "title": "A friend is contemplating the idea of making a terrible decision which will lead to him being kicked out and most probably killing himself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Caseasps", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594862800, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hs0j6x/a_friend_is_contemplating_the_idea_of_making_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425246.6729467, "replies_charged": false}
