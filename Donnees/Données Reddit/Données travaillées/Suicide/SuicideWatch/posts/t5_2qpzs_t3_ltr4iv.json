Every few minutes I'm breaking down in tears and thinking about killing myself in a few days. The reason for the breakup was that he wasn't ready for a full out relationship yet but he still loves me and recently admitted he misses us.\n\nWe've been so close for nearly a year.  We both had the same interests, hobbies and we even had the same rare issue with our bodies which really made us more connected if that makes any sense. We did stuff daily and we've both waited so long for this moment but our relationship ended in 4 weeks. He's the most precious person I've met and I still adore him. He said there could be a chance in the future but I can't wait that long. I'm not strong enough and I'm just done with all the heartache. \n\nI've been suffering from depression and suicide for years and this breakup has been the push I needed to finally take action but I'm scared of the pain. My mind isn't there anymore and I don't know what to do. He was the only reason why I got out of bed & took care of myself etc.\n\nPlease, if anyone reads this what do I do? I'm so lonely and confused. \n\nApologise if this post doesn't make much sense.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ltr4iv/my_soul_mate_left_me_yesterday_and_its_massively/", "title": "My soul mate left me yesterday and it's massively increased my urge to kill myself.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Odin_7294", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614441811, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ltr4iv/my_soul_mate_left_me_yesterday_and_its_massively/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425181.2302055, "replies_charged": false}
