My sense of reality, I let her hold on to too much of myself. I waited 7 months to sleep with her, my standards are two years but she insisted and It seemed like a love story. Shes gone. Ive been sleeping around with girls much more attractive and I am a very attractive, \u201ccrowd controlling\u201d, successful guy, i click with everyone, my humor is exclusive and unmatched, i never had such low thoughts. But now I feel objectified. Like despite all my success im unwanted for my true self. At 16 I paid off my mothers mortgage of $70,000. She hates me still i try to act like she\u2019s grateful but is it so hard? To just be nice? To regret disliking someone? People are noticing my social immaturity in dealing with depression, im thinking of disappearing and dedicating my entire life to something in the engineering department, just cause its a slower form of dying in my opinion. Otherwise suicide seems so pathetic rn but Im seriously so close. My intelligence feels like a joke.
