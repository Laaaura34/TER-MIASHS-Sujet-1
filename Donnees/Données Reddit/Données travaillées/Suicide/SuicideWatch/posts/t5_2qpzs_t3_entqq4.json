I can count a few times where I had to fight back tears at work - apropos of no immediate problem - just dissatisfaction with my life, and dwelling on it. I\u2019ll never be that guy. I\u2019ll never be that attractive or that outwardly confident. I\u2019m 5\u201910\u201d, severely balding at 24, unable to put any muscle on my arms (despite weight training every other day for the past 4 years and consuming a shit load of protein powder), and with an extremely mediocre face. I\u2019ve consulted a cosmetic surgeon about the balding and was turned away because I\u2019m literally losing too much hair.\n\nI thought that I could compensate for my physical shortcomings by just having a really successful career and making money - that\u2019s the conventional wisdom anyway. So I studied a ton and got a good job. A week ago my salary got raised into the six-figure range. None of it has made a difference. Since getting hired and becoming \u201csuccessful\u201d nothing has changed. I just have more money and nothing to do with it.\n\nI know it\u2019s dumb to get hung up on a 20 second video for which I have almost no context - but it so perfectly crystallized all the shit I\u2019ve been feeling for a long time. There are people who are just hot. It\u2019s just easy for them to meet and date the kinds of people they want. I\u2019m not. I won\u2019t be, regardless of how much effort I put in. And I don\u2019t want to live the life implied by that fact. I don\u2019t want to be alone. And I don\u2019t want to settle. And I don\u2019t want to keep putting in effort without any kind of hope or validation that it\u2019s not being completely wasted. It\u2019s become painful. The things I used to like now just make me sick. I just want to die.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/entqq4/stuck_with_the_mind_and_body_i_was_born_into/", "title": "stuck with the mind and body I was born into; realizing the limitations of my immutable flaws; I don\u2019t want to live my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "_up_and_get_me", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1578864361, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/entqq4/stuck_with_the_mind_and_body_i_was_born_into/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426241.2547286, "replies_charged": false}
