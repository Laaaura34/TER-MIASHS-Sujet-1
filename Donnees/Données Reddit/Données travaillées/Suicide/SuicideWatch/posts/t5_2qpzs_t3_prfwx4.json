And why should they be? I\u2019m not anyone special, I haven\u2019t contributed anything to our society (not that I really want to because it\u2019s so god-awful).\nI\u2019m just a tiny blip in this world.\n\nBut my feelings are huge, and my struggles are real, and it makes every day more and more difficult to wake up to. So this is my last try on Reddit, to find some sort of advice or since of direction so I can find the strength to keep going.\n\nI\u2019m so poor, and my skills limit me to working customer service jobs, which are draining on my mental health and don\u2019t pay nearly enough to sustain myself on. I don\u2019t have a car of my own or anyway to get around on my own. I\u2019m stuck in a shitty roach-infested apartment that costs way more than it\u2019s worth. The owners aren\u2019t doing shit about the bugs, but I\u2019ll be leaving this place soon anyway.\n\nI\u2019m in a relationship with someone I never wanted to be with, and being with him is so draining, but I would have absolutely nothing without him now. (He\u2019s not abusive we just aren\u2019t working out) I have no friends of my own, and very few people I can rely on, all of whom are in no position to help me.\n\nI feel like if I stay, I\u2019ll die, but if I try to leave, I\u2019ll loose the few things I actually have. If I could get out of here and get started again on my own, knowing I could support myself I would have already. \n\nIt feels like my only way out now is to die.\nMy dreams feel so far away, and unreachable. I really feel like I never had a chance. \n\nCan anyone give me any advice? Anything that can help me? I\u2019ve never needed help this much before.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/prfwx4/i_feel_stuck_useless_and_like_id_be_better_off/", "title": "I feel stuck, useless, and like I\u2019d be better off dead.
