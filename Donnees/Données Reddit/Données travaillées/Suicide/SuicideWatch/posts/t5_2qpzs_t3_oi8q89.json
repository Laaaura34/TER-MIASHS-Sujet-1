My family only cares for me when it comes to ask for a service or a favour, and they don't really care for me, whether it would be successes or when I'm down. I'm destroying my mental and physical health in studying law even though I don't even think I want it to be my future. \n\nAll day, I'm cleaning, doing chores, cooking for someone who doesn't even thank me and just doesn't care about it. I feel like a burden to my friends, to my boyfriend, and I don't see myself keeping it like that.\n\nI'm exhausted, I don't even want to die but I just want it to stop. I'm killing myself with anxiety, I hate myself, and I keep pushing my limits even though I know I've crossed them long ago. \n\nI can't see a therapist, I can't take time for me, I just don't know what to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oi8q89/i_dont_know_if_im_capable_of_committing_suicide/", "title": "I don't know if I'm capable of committing suicide, but the thought of it became more real every day.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ThrowRA196192", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 73, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626024587, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oi8q89/i_dont_know_if_im_capable_of_committing_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428327.077533, "replies_charged": false}
