I feel like I put up a front, an outside shell every hour of every day that I don't have to myself and it just gets so exhausting sometimes. Most days in fine but some days I just can't take it, like today.\n\nI was at work, everything seemingly normal with me as far as others were concerned. I had to take a breath in the warehouse and just unwind my mind for a second, a co worker found me there clearly in shambles about to cry. I had to explain to them what was going on, and how the burden of my front just wears me down sometimes, and they just couldn't understand what I meant. \n\n\"You always seem so happy\" \n\"you never seemed like the sad type to me\"\n\nWell, yes that's the point of the front. If I didn't put on the airs of a happy go lucky person then my mental state would be truly horrific, and I'm unsure if I would be here today.\n\nBut some days it's just so fucking exhausting, and that's okay.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pxtn6a/tired_of_being_tired/", "title": "Tired of being tired", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NewAccount764664", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 72, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632915916, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pxtn6a/tired_of_being_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426289.0839424, "replies_charged": false}
