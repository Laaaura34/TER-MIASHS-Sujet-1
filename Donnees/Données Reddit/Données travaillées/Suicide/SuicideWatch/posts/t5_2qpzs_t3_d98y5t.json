I Enjoyed tones of rep sports, friends, family and even got a pretty spoiled childhood. But no one knows me. I could always make some plans but never got invited out by someone else. I dont think im ugly or anything. I just dont know whats wrong, everything i liked doing felt like choirs and i stopped liking them. Slowly over the years nothing makes me enjoy life. Its always about getting through the next step. Whatever it ends up being. I obviously get through it but for what... Fortune in the future?? I couldnt care less. Theres nothing out there that couldnt be done by any other licensed person out there (welding). I dont know. Ive just always been a nice person that legitimately and honestly expected nothing in return, maybe people just know to run all over me? Ive always thought about suicide and pretty much to the extrem aswell. Ive got multiple cuts ive been able to play off easily with a random story. I dont think ill ever be happy. \nThanks if you read this far bc i never normally complain about anything.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d98y5t/nothings_happy/", "title": "Nothings happy", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "allwaysoption2", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1569442710, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d98y5t/nothings_happy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427149.0002427, "replies_charged": false}
