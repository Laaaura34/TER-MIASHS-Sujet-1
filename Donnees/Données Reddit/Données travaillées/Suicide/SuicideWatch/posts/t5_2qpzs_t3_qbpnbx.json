I don\u2019t blame them, most of the youth suicide stories come from impulsive, depressive, psychotic, abused, or guilty backgrounds. Trust me, I\u2019ve had a fair share of tragedy and horrors that I\u2019ve had to deal with at a young age, but for me, it\u2019s a little different. I\u2019ve always had the magical theory that everybody has some sort of meaning, either major or minor. Well, nowadays, it feels like my meaning is to have no meaning. I\u2019m average. I\u2019m not pretty, I\u2019m not athletic, I\u2019m not clever or smart. I don\u2019t keep up with trends, neither do I make a point to reject them. Etc etc. I\u2019m just there. I\u2019ve lost the motivation to live, because why keep on when I might just be rotting in a cubicle for the next 40 years of my life? There\u2019s nothing important or special about me, nothing stands out, nothing about me is lovable or likable. Those who do \u201ccare\u201d for me are obligated by biological blood, pity me, use(d) me, you get the point. I don\u2019t want to pass on the grief, because I don\u2019t exactly hate anyone. Life for me is just gray. If anything is interesting about me, it\u2019s my overbearing impatience and fear. The future used to keep me going: the idea I\u2019d be a prominent, rich figure in society if I kept working hard. But I\u2019m afraid. I don\u2019t want to live on the rest of these days to get to there, I can\u2019t wait that long. I want to be forgotten, to be a fuzzy memory, and unfortunately, the only way to achieve that is to die. I\u2019ve planned on going sometime later this week. There\u2019s still a voice in my head that tells me to stay, that there\u2019s a future ahead, that I do mean something and I do have purpose, but that voice has been getting quieter and quieter. Sometimes, I can\u2019t even hear it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbpnbx/i_dont_want_to_die_i_just_dont_want_to_exist/", "title": "I don\u2019t want to die, I just don\u2019t want to exist.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Lisumimia", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634692449, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbpnbx/i_dont_want_to_die_i_just_dont_want_to_exist/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423154.5539954, "replies_charged": false}
