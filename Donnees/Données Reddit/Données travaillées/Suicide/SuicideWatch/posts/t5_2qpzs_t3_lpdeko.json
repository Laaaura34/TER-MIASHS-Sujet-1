I'm just a mess and I really just don't give a shit anymore. Part of me always wants to live but fuck I'm hurting ask the time, I'm tired and want to just take the pills and let go of all this mess I fell into. Any suggestions or words of comfort would be of great help tonight. Please get me through the night.\n\nEdit: My sister ended up calling me and I was able to vent to her. She's amazing and patient. I have a combination of ptsd, bpd, and major depression plus possible adhd. She was able to help talk me through my pressing problems and offer goals for the week. It's made me hopeful.
