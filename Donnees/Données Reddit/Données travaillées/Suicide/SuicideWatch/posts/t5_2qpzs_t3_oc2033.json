I realized today that the chorus of this song actually reminds me before all of this began, it\u2019s like me asking myself if I ever remember being a completely different person - before I lost my father, before I lost my job due to my mental illness, before I wished to never wake up again after going to bed.  \n\nThe song is \u201cHeartbreak Anniversary\u201d by Giveon.  Below are lyrics I am referring to.  \n\n\n\u201cJust like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever\nSaid that you love me, but that'll last for never\nIt's cold outside like when you walked out my life\nWhy you walk out my life?\n\n[Chorus]\nI get like this every time\nOn these days that feel like you and me\nHeartbreak anniversary\n'Cause I remember every time\nOn these days that feel like you and me\nHeartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?\u201d \n\nAlthough the lyrics are about someone and a relationship, to me, it\u2019s me asking my past self about those days before I was diagnosed with bipolar depression, the days I used to love myself and be proud of what I had become.  Do you ever think of me? \n\nI know this isn\u2019t exactly a suicide note, but I posted here because I fantasize about my death every night.  Even though I don\u2019t have a plan to actually follow through with, I have however put together a mental note of the things I would need to complete before The day I actually end my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oc2033/rollercoaster_of_moods_today_i_am_back_to_the/", "title": "Rollercoaster of moods, today I am back to the dark isolated room stuck with intrusive thoughts, fantasizing about wanting to end my life.
