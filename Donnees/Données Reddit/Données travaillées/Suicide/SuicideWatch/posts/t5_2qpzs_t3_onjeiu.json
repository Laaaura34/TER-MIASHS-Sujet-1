Last year I maimed myself trying to end my life. I was in hospital for over 6 months and I can no longer eat, sleep, or exist without complication and pain. \n\nOn top of all of this I just became homeless and have no way to care for myself without assistance. \n\nI don't care about life anymore. I don't see the point in fighting to live with my quality of life. I feel awful because everyone wants me to be this strong person who has overcome something, but I haven't.\n\nIf I has in that situation again I wouldn't stop myself, I would make sure I got the job done.\n\n\nI've had a very difficult time finding anyone who really understands what it's like to be reminded every day. \n\nIf anyone knows any resources for something like this, or just personal stories, I'd love to hear them.
