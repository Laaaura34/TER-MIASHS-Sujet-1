No matter how many times I think about it, I can't understand why. Someone once asked me what would I do if I saw a man standing on the edge of a building and...To this day I wonder. My first impulse is to do something, anything.But that is quickly replaced by the thought \"Why?\". Probably this person is like me and just wants to die, so who am I to stop him?In the end, it seems to me that the only thing I could do is let this person know that I can see and care for him and that he can talk to me. Ask him if he is sure of his choice. But I don't see myself saying \"Don't do this.\" Does that make me a bad person? Everyone around me says suicide is wrong, but I don't see it that way.
