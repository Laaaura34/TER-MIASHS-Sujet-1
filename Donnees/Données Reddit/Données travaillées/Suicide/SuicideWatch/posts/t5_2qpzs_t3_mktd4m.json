Im ready to leave this body and never come back in it. I of course hate myself but i hate people the most. I always take the high road because if i followed through with my thoughts, it would be real life GTA klling everyone that is in my path until im \"WASTED\". You would think if you have nothing to lose and don't bother anyone, people will not bother you or try to make things worse for you. I say to myself if anyone idc about your gender bothers me to the point i snap, you deserved it in my eyes. I wont care if im wrong', i wont care if you play victim. I purposely burned bridges with the family i hated after my grandma passed. My name is Parish. And i have nothing else so if anyone feel the need to take it there with me even though you have things going for you, make sur3 its worth it. I ll never change because i dont want to change while in this body. Im through with this flesh. Certain things you do in this world CANNOT be forgiven. Especially if you are everything i just mentioned. F you Clinton Jones idc if u lived or dii eed. Everyone else \ud83d\udd95but you in particular freemason Clinton Jones i ll sacrifice you to come up in this world.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mktd4m/my_flaws_my_truth_an_abomination_upon_the_earth/", "title": "My flaws.
