My parents fight all the time , hit each other , hit me, yell at me , shame me for simply existing. The only thing that my mom ever did for me was to giving me an eating disorder , anorexia , and now my only purpose is to starve myself to death. At school I\u2019m even more miserable , alone in a filthy  bathroom cutting myself and then bleeding , and nobody says anything , because nobody cares. They can only yell. For what ? Why so much yelling ? \n\nI was raped as a 9 year old , and nobody gave a damn. Why would they , my parents , care ? Why take responsablity for your child , when you can leave anytime? \n\nAnd now , after this tragic backstory , there \u2018s nothing. There is no saving event , there is no guardian angel coming to guide  me , there is nothing , because I\u2019m nothing. Nothing will change. I\u2019m not special. I\u2019m not outstanding. I don\u2019t deserve to be saved. I might as well die. I might as well die now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/plrctp/i_feel_like_a_useless_piece_of_crap/", "title": "I feel like a useless piece of crap", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hzhhzbz", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631300473, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/plrctp/i_feel_like_a_useless_piece_of_crap/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422256.4664922, "replies_charged": false}
