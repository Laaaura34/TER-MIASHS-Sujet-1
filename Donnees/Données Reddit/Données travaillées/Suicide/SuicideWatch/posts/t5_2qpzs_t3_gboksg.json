I've been thinking about this story for ages. I thought I'd share this awfully stupid story since I've cried three times today. Usually my emotions are dried up but today some unexpected rain has filled my desert of a heart.\n\nThis story is the time I feared for my life. For my mother's life. For my cat's life. It was one of the darkest days of my life.\n\nUs three had been staying with my mother's boyfriend, along with his two 20 plus year old daughters who were okay, better than my brothers. The house was small, I slept in the living room with no privacy which I needed very much at that time. The two cats fought and the house was constantly filthy as me and my mum were the only ones to attack the years and years of neglect. I mean, bugs infested the place, I was terrified to go to sleep. It damaged me a bit, I must say. I couldn't take it anymore and my mum had been saving since their relationship was crumbling due to the power struggle.\n\nWe didn't have enough money to get a place of our own so we settled for a shared house, aka one room to both of us and a kitchen, with a mum and child from the home education community. We'll call her Grace and the child Max. Max was non-binary and proudly pan. Grace was bi, basically letting her boyfriend live with them. They smoked weed around Max, which I hated, and let Max play with knives. They had a beautiful pit bull which they neglected, forgot to feed, kicked, and didn't walk. We did that, seeing as we hated how the dog was treated. We didn't have a choice but to stay there. Looking back, I see so many red flags but I was blinded by a very funny friend and a LGBTQ+ proud family.\n\nWe stayed there for about six months. They were overly nice but made excuses with any housework. We paid alot to stay there and it was so overpriced, not to mention they were letting the room illegally. The boyfriend encouraged Grace to smoke more, spend less time with Max and more with him. She did. Max acted out, took it out on the home-ed Community which already hated them for their rudeness and laziness. They turned my best friend's friends against her and treated me like shit when I was alone at the house. Grace ignored Max's actions and was more focused on going out and having new things.\n\nIt got bad with the dog, Max was abusing it too since their dad's dog was \"better in every way\". I felt so bad, wanted to help it. I saw the happiness in its eyes to be fed and play, the sadness when denied attention by her owners. One night, when they had ordered a take away, like they did every night, they didn't get up to answer the door. They never get up, we always have to answer it. It was 9pm, we were trying to sleep as we'd been to a funeral that day and were not only physically tired but emotionally tired as well.\n\nThe delivery man knocked the door, walked away, came back and knocked it, walked away, came back. It was annoying us and we weren't in the mood to deal with her shit. My mum shouted at the man for going and coming when Grace came down to answer. \n\"You've ordered food?\" \n\"No. Its my roomate, never answers the fucking door.\"\nGrace walked to the door,\n\"Is everything okay?\"\n\"No, this fucking man keeps messing me about and you never fucking go to the door when you're expecting food.\"\nWe went to our room which was just by the front door. There's no lock, no privacy, so she just burst in.\n\"Sorry but fuck you, Cunt. I can't believe you would talk to me that way, you are such a fucking cunt.\"\nMe and my mum had a rule. You can swear but you don't swear at people. We never used the word cunt either, it was vulgar to me, a real insult. It is so degrading and just disgusting. I'm getting tired writing this, drained at the memories flooding back. It's only the second time I've really feared for my life.\nMy mum burst out of the room and they argued. Grace was big, she looked scary and she had told us stories about how she had knocked people's teeth in before. I was scared so I shut the door on her. Grace screamed and retreated upstairs. I didn't sleep that night. I was too scared that she might come down, stab one of us or my cat. She had shown us red flags, her behaviour, how unstable she was. She was unpredictable.\n\nNothing happened that night thankfully but the next morning, we quietly packed everything up and went to live with my brother, which was a hell itself. But it was better than living with the constant fear that you could be murdered. We left a note, explaining why we left and why there would be no more money. It was around Christmas so she would've read it the day after christmas. She sent a message, claiming we needed to pay extra money for bills when we didn't. My mother put Grace in her place and she sent hundreds of texts, threats, swearing, telling us to kill ourselves which I was already on the verge of, since I  was the most depressed I'd ever been. She texted me that she wished that we were dead, that were worthless and little. Whory. Cunts. That stuck in my head for a while.\n\nWe contacted animal abuse services and the police about the weed and the illegal subletting. I'm scared to this day they might find us, seeing as the home-ed community is very open. They could be at an event, they could be at a party, a performance. They could be anywhere but a dog park.\n\nI think about why she was like this. Why she didn't do anything that night. I guess she just didn't want the police to find the weed she had. Not our bodies, just the weed.\n\nThanks for reading, it doesn't sound as scary as it was but I am emotional from writing this. I'm not stable either, I am like a rock balancing on the edge of a table. One nudge and I will fall.
