I truly do not have the support system I need , and I feel completely broken and useless. I\u2019ve tried many routes and people who don\u2019t understand wont understand this. \n My body\u2019s been used up , I\u2019ve had family members molest me , beat me and abuse me in every way possible. I\u2019ve watched my mom with a shotgun to her head to growing up now and realizing how fucked this world is. \n   In December of last year everyone forgot my bday which was fine sis turned 21 so I had like 4 blunts ready to go , so I just drank and met up w some dude to smoke , he laced my shit and I woke up a mess in my car in so much pain and he was gone. Blocked off the app I used and gone from my life.and I know he\u2019s doing it to others. I failed to stop it. Being used the way I was while asleep has left me feeling COMPLETELY Downright disgusting. \nAnd now afterwards everything just hits. I\u2019ve been in around 10 different places this year alone from Stockton to Fresno and in between. I feel so much more alienated the more I move. \n   I didn\u2019t give up after the rape. I moved myself to Stockton with my little money , I fought my own anxiety\u2019s until they were unbearable. Losing my high school crush to suicide right after finally starting to have him to myself in may.  to friends stealing from me and to my \u201c friend \u201c now kicking me out. It\u2019s been a road. But I truly feel it\u2019s the end. \n   I just wanna run away to Oregon and relieve myself there. Completely and fully. Idk how to do it and honestly don\u2019t wanna do it alone , because the fear of pain and that moment of regret but I know I want to do it. I just wanna spend the weekend with the trees and swimming and smoking blunts and taking acid , I wanna fully cherish nature and then become one with it. This world isn\u2019t for me. Growing in a world as an empath has no meaning but every piece of pain is like a knife and I\u2019ve been truly staring at myself wondering why tf I\u2019m still here. \n   Ide rather be in Oregon right now. \n I wish I could have a suicide pact with someone but I couldn\u2019t watch someone else go. Or have that thought to have a beautiful soul next to me go along w me. But it deff would make it easier. \n  ( sorry if this was a mess. there\u2019s so much more to my pain but I just wanted to write quick. I have to pack again and figure out where to go next if it\u2019s still even worth it. )", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgqd3z/forests_of_oregon/", "title": "Forests of Oregon.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Trippyvinnn", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603470264, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgqd3z/forests_of_oregon/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427703.8569026, "replies_charged": false}
