TW: selfharm, eating disorders, anxiety, suicide(?), depression\n\n\nfirst off im 15, so if i went to one it would probably be shitty.\n2nd idk if i am jus depressed or genuinely suicidal. i have a plan to kill myself after im 18, and right now i am only living for my pets, friends, and family. but some days i feel good, but most of the time im just progressively getting worse. im in therapy and on medication (1st was prozac, then lexapro, now zoloft), and im going to get genetic testing to possibly see what meds are \u201csupposed\u201d to work for me if the zoloft doesnt work (its not clearly). plus in the next couple of months i have adhd and mood disorder testing. but honestly i just keep getting worse.\nmy anxiety has never been as bad. in public, its insane, im constantly focused on every move i make, every step, every facial feature, who i look at if someone is talking to me, etc. plus now i weirdly have anxiety over being in the car (not driving, just sitting in the car). where i literally have anxiety attacks because i constantly think we\u2019re gonna get hit/hit someone.\ni havent cut since april, and since november i began self harming again, and its even worse than \u201cusual.\u201d\nalso i keep relapsing of my eating disorder, bulimia. i have episodes where i binge for weeks, and then dont eat at all/purge every meal.\ni don\u2019t know if i should go in, to a ward, or just wait out my therapy and meds.\nand if you think i should go in, how would i tell my parents? i refently told my mom about self harm and it wad the hardest and most awkward conversation ever, so if you have an advice i would be super gratefulz\n\nthank you for reading", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l8i4ic/do_i_go_to_a_phsyc_ward/", "title": "do i go to a phsyc ward?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "shae-butter", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611998992, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l8i4ic/do_i_go_to_a_phsyc_ward/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422931.9917579, "replies_charged": false}
