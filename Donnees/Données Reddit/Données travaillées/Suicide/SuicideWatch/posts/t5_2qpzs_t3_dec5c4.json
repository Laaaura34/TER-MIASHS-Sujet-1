This is almost 300 days old and has no upvotes, so I\u2019m impressed you scrolled that much. \n\nAnyways. If you\u2019re in this tag, I\u2019d like you to read what I\u2019m about to say, and then my OG post from a year ago about. \nIt\u2019s been like ~250 days and my quality of life has improved so much. I\u2019ve grown more comfortable with my sexuality, I\u2019ve confronted and started over with my mother, my sister is in therapy. I no longer think about the assault all that time ago, (I still fear men to a degree, being alone with older men makes me itchy). I do not cry myself to sleep, I don\u2019t hurt myself. Things aren\u2019t perfect, I just got hurt pretty badly working out, and I have issues with body image and weight, and anxiety over my future, but I know I can make it work. It does get better, it really does. I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that I\u2019m happier by myself and have let go of the stigma that comes with being a \u2018loner\u2019, and I graduated! I have that associates and my diploma, and I\u2019m headed to a four year to start to bachelors. Sure, maybe my funeral would still only be my mom and sister, but that\u2019s enough for me. I am happy, even when it gets so tough. I have control of myself, of my body image and my future, instead of feeling hopeless.\nIt does get better, and if you think no one cares- I do- and someone you know does. Promise.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\n\nI hate writing. I don\u2019t want to write all this out but I can\u2019t fucking keep it in anymore. My life is worthless, I am worthless, there is not a soul who would notice if I was dangling in a noose in the fucking dining room. No one would bat an eyelash. I do not matter. I\u2019m 17, f, lesbian. God where do I BEGIN? Ten I started to be really sad a lot, I quit playing with friends and going to the playground, i stayed on the school steps and half-slept by the gate. At twelve I\u2019d lost all my friends and the middle school bullying for weight and appearance began. I knew I was gay around then. That didn\u2019t have much to do with my depression until lately though. I haven\u2019t had any true, non-talk-behind-my-back-friends since then. My middle school years saw the onset of insomnia, and a botched spinal tap when I had seizures at 8 has left me with constant tension headache, and migraines daily. I am in constant pain. I\u2019m too afraid to get on drugs because it\u2019ll ruin my kidneys or make me gain weight or something. That\u2019s just my health issues though. The bullying was hard for me and having no friends sucked, yea, but that\u2019s life, I was depressed, i cried myself to sleep and wondered why no one liked me, i was never close to my parents Because my dad is really quiet and my mom is very narcissistic. That was okay though, I was fine. And then in 7th grade I got molested and raped at school and then it was all downhill. Any hope I had for it to even out eventually was gone. Nobody knows to this very day except for one ex of mine. Not even my mom. I drug myself home and acted normal as possible and my anxiety, fear of others, men especially, and depressed worsened a TON. I didn\u2019t feel like I could tell anyone. I felt like I would be degraded. Who\u2019d accept a friend or a daughter who\u2019d been degraded and violated? So I gave up on reaching out and being optimistic. I quit crying even. I had no more tears left. I grew further from my mom, who only grew more hostile. I left school and joined an online program for ninth grade because I couldn\u2019t take going to school anymore. The hatred, the name calling, the exclusion. It was nice to be locked in my room doing school, my depression wasn\u2019t too much to bear if i never had to get up and get ready or let anyone see me or risk being hurt again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dec5c4/i_cant/", "title": "I cant", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "stopitgerald", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1570409259, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dec5c4/i_cant/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427160.2990725, "replies_charged": false}
