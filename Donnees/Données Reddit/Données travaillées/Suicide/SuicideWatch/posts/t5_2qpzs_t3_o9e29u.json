To me it's kinda like brushing your teeth, you don't really get involved with that. When I was in school a girl noticed my cuts, I know she just wanted to do \"the right thing\" she did not mean harm in any way, but it still upset me. I had to talk to a counselor and I hate doing that.. I got my way out of it but it still had me shaken up. Personally I don't want people to get involved with my \"hobby??\" Idk what to call it... I know it sounds bad, but I just want to do the things I want to do freely, sometimes I do like to \"practice\" or attempt but I don't think I'll ever go through with it, it's not hurting anyone so why care so much? \njust curious on what anyone else thinks.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o9e29u/is_selfharm_suicide_attemptsor_practice_really/", "title": "Is self-harm/ suicide attempts(or practice?)
