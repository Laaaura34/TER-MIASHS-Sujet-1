Wife picked me up on discharge and dumped me at a hotel not allowing me to come home. 2 year old twins that I am only allowed to see out of the house. Gave up my career and moved away from family to be with her. She\u2019s a fucking divorce lawyer so will get whatever she wants. I have absolutely no will left to live. Had a plan to kill myself the same way my mother did by passing out in the garage with vehicle running. Apparently new vehicles don\u2019t emit enough carbon monoxide to kill you.  Does anyone know if that\u2019s true. I would just like to go peacefully the same way my mom did. Meds and more meds and therapy not helping. I don\u2019t think anything can help when your family gives up on you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qdiy6y/cant_do_it_anymore_tired_of_living_in_pain_and/", "title": "Can\u2019t do it anymore.
