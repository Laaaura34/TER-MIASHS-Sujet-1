SWIM has never been one to truly begin a plan for the end of their life until now. SWIM is in their 20's, and works a dead-end job as an Assistant Manager. They've been in therapy for about 2 years now but never medicated. They're not sure exactly what's wrong with them because they've never *truly* been diagnosed with anything other than anxiety. They feel as if life is a constant repeat of disappointment, loneliness, and sadness. They have close friends and people they truly love to their core, but have never really had any true intimate or romantic connection with everyone. They've tried, and have dated before, but nothing ever felt like it was real. After many failed attempts at romantic connection, there is no success. They accept that it's okay to be alone, and have no issues with that, but wonder what is wrong with them to the point that after many years, any romantic attempt is a failure? They wonder why they feel a complete and total isolation from even their closest friends and family, feeling like they've never *really* been a part of any of it. Isolation, which, in a way could be self inflicted, is the most prevalent issue facing them. Recently they've turned to drugs, especially stimulants and alcohol, to attempt to stave away these feelings, and create a feeling of 'success' insofar as feeling productive, which, at the end of the day, is only a result of being high on stimulants.   \n\n\nMost days, they wake up tired and angry. Angry they woke up that day. Tired because they refused to sleep until 3 hours prior to having to wake up. The first thought they have every day is of their own death. Sometimes, they imagine how they would Do It. A bridge? Too poetic. A gun? Too Messy. Another Way? It doesn't really matter to them, as long as it's somehow.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q6far1/was_i_built_to_always_be_miserable/", "title": "Was I Built To Always Be Miserable?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwawayafter232", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 20, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634017589, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q6far1/was_i_built_to_always_be_miserable/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635425580.436549, "replies_charged": false}
