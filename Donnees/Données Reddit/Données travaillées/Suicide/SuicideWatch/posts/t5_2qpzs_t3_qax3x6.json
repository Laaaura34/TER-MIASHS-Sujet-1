I have very horrible anxiety, depression, PTSD, bipolar and more. Did the first time I can remember I had found stability and happiness that I find think I've ever had.  I found an amazing job that I loved very much, the party was insane, and I just actually genuinely enjoyed my job.  About a month ago I started getting horrible chronic pain, mobility and breathing issues. I can barely do anything I love or enjoy at this point. with no idea of the cause or end in sight. I had been managing to go to work everyday and just kinda pushing myself through the pain and probably making it worse. My manager constantly told me how good of a job I've been doing and how much he liked me. Today I get a call at work from my contracting agency that the contract was terminated and no reason was given. Like I had literally just had a conversation with my boss the day before in our touch base and he said he couldn't be happier... I'm devistated and honestly between the pain, hoplessness,loss of insurance and risk in of homelessness I'm just ready to finally successfully go through with suicide. I've got like 80 mg of cyclobenapri, 15 mg of oxycodone and 45000 mg of gabapentin. Not sure if I'll need it all, but I'm gonna go out drinking tonight and hopefully between it all everything will work out.\n\nWish me luck. I really wanted to love life, but I just think it's not for me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qax3x6/life_is_falling_apart/", "title": "life is falling apart", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "worthlessgirl08", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634594602, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qax3x6/life_is_falling_apart/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427922.5203314, "replies_charged": false}
