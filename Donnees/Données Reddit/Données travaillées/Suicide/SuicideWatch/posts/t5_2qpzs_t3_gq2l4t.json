I opened up to them and I\u2019m in a a really bad slump right now. I don\u2019t come out of my room that much. My state hasn\u2019t changed over the past year and a half but telling my parents makes me feel like I don\u2019t have to hide it anymore. They keep trying to help me but don\u2019t understand that this isn\u2019t something I can just wake up one day and choose to conquer. I\u2019ve dedicated my life to beating this. It\u2019s all I live for. I only keep living because I feel like there is hope. My parents are trying to help me but they can\u2019t help. They take away my video games which is my way of coping and it is fucking me up. It\u2019s really sad but when I don\u2019t binge play video games I get suicidal thoughts. My parents think that I can just decide to fight it and everything will be okay. They are unable to see that I\u2019ve been fighting this for a year. This is my fucking life. I have nothing else to live for besides getting over this shit. They see me lying in bed and take it as a fact that I\u2019m not trying and I don\u2019t want to get better. They can only see the surface. They think if I get out of bed I will be happier. Being in bed is what keeps me from suicide. They only see the surface. I don\u2019t know how to communicate the rest to them. They don\u2019t understand how far they are from knowing everything that\u2019s going on with me. They don\u2019t know how much I haven\u2019t told them. They don\u2019t know what I\u2019m really feeling. They don\u2019t really even know me. I love my parents but they are making things so much worse. They think that I don\u2019t want to fight but they don\u2019t know how much I want to be better. They think that somehow my view of the world is impaired but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s crystal fucking clear. I completely understand how horrible my life looks from an outside perspective. All I want is to fix myself but they can\u2019t see that in the slightest bit. I don\u2019t know what to do. My mom came in today and started yelling at me. I told her to \u201cfuck off\u201d (I know I\u2019m a fucking terrible person). She started crying. This broke my heart. They care too much but they simply can\u2019t see the whole picture. It\u2019s not that simple for me and they don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t know what to do. I simply can\u2019t communicate that they don\u2019t understand to them. Every time I tell them this I think that they think that this is my way of self preservation. I just want more time to pass so I can be sad. I don\u2019t even know how that\u2019s logical. All I live for is to see a happier tomorrow they don\u2019t get it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gq2l4t/people_are_ignorant/", "title": "People are ignorant.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "goodbyeillmissliving", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1590373392, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gq2l4t/people_are_ignorant/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426239.928723, "replies_charged": false}
