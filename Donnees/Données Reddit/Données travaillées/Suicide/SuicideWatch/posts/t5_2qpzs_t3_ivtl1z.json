Have not been able to recover. Marriage went to shit, it had been a struggle for years. I have a 15 year old son that I feel guilty about for not being the father that he needs now. I am depressed barely functional in daily activities and feel inept. I have someone that loves me and wants me to get better but I just don\u2019t have the drive or motivation or just feel lost. My ego might also be a problem. Where I was and how I\u2019ve fallen and to start at a lower place at 50. Sleep is a problem. Ruminations, constant fatigue and negativity. Lack of motivation. No goal or purpose. Have lost my passion.\nMeds don\u2019t help. Therapy, can\u2019t keep a constant train of thought. People that care don\u2019t seem to understand. I don\u2019t even understand. I am handsome, look fit. Can be helpful and joyful with others. But inside I am full of guilt, shame, apathy, low self esteem and self sabotage. And my world that I used to be in control off, used to travel and enjoy the outdoors and be very active physically and healthy...now I\u2019m just barely hanging on. Can\u2019t barely function one day at a time. Food shopping is extremely difficult. Any decision is difficult. Driving I\u2019m distracted all the time. I have work opportunities that are physical that I used to enjoy. Now I feel too weak or distracted or inept.\n\nHow do I recover? How do I gain control? When I don\u2019t even want to go outside? Or be around people? Or pay bills? Or even take care of my basic needs.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ivtl1z/i_have_constant_thoughts_of_ending_my_life/", "title": "I have constant thoughts of ending my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "surfndivejr", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1600525969, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ivtl1z/i_have_constant_thoughts_of_ending_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428071.2223892, "replies_charged": false}
