So i was forced into a relationship that i dont want to for the past 2 years. In that time, no matter how hard i try to love her back, i just cant. The trauma i got from my previous relationship is just too severe that i think I'm dead inside and i cant fully love someone ever again.\n\nAnd now i really did fckd up, got her pregnant. In a place where married by accident is a taboo thing, i just did that. To make matter worse, we have different religion, me myself are not a religious person. Thats one of the reason i still have the energy to be at her side. But not our family, which is kind of a fanatic. And again, we live in a country drunk on religion. I just did 2 of \"kind of seven deadly sins\" in my country. Oh, and i currently unemployed because of this flippin covid. I fckd up, big time.\n\nI'm just tired of it, tired of living with all these never ending problems. I'm a coward, and a really bad person, i know. I'm a blacksheep of my family, I'm a bad bf for my gf who love me dearly, a useless friend, and for my unborn child, I'm a very terrible father. I just want to end it all. For once, i want to ignore all the feelings and opinion of everybody, and be egoistic just for myself, just for once.\n\nAlready book a hotel room for tomorrow for 2 nights, bought a lot of pesticides. I'm ready.\n\nThank you, for whoever reading this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/js5dc5/i_fckd_up/", "title": "I fckd up", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "grimj0w", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605088194, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/js5dc5/i_fckd_up/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428485.3192854, "replies_charged": false}
