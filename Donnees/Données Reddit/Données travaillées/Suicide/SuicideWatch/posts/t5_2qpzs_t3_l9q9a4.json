I know im only 20 but I know for a fact that if i were still alone 5-10 years from now i would rather be fuckin dead. Im not taking any chances waiting to see what happens in the future so im really hoping i can die now tbh.  the pain is just not worth living through. being alone your whole life and not knowing what it's like to be in love is by far the most painful experience ive ever gone through in my life.  Ive experienced other things ofc but nothing amounts to the amount of pain ive experienced due to me being alone and feeling like an unloveable creature that was just put here to be alone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l9q9a4/committing_suicide_cause_i_cant_get_a_girlfriend/", "title": "Committing suicide cause I cant get a girlfriend", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nmillion", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612139412, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l9q9a4/committing_suicide_cause_i_cant_get_a_girlfriend/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428380.419106, "replies_charged": false}
