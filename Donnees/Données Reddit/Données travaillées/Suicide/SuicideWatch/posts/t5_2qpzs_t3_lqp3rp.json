I have lost everything over the last two years and have isolated myself from the few friends and family I still had. It used to be the guilt of leaving my son and my dogs that kept me from killing myself but I\u2019m starting to realise that they would be better off without me. I am in a constant battle in my head trying to decide if I am causing my son more pain by killing my self or by remaining in his life as a depressed, worthless woman.
