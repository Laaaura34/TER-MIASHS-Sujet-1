I excelled in school, hardly ever got yelled at or smacked, and was overall just a happy little boy... my teachers used to call me \"chuckles\".\n\nAfter reaching university, everything changed. I had always been lazy, letting my natural intelligence carry me through school and upon reaching university, where attendance in class is not required, my laziness overcame my will to learn, and I stopped attending. I instead chose to spend my time with my new friend... a pot smoking philosophy major. I was introduced to drugs and god did I ever enjoy them. After a few weeks of smoking cannabis, I discovered \"synthetic cannabis\" (also known as \"K2\" or \"Spice\", among many other names), which was more powerful than weed ever could have been. I would like to stop here to mention that the term \"synthetic cannabis\" is not an accurate or deserved description of this drug. The drug and alcohol professionals I have been talking to believe the substance to be far more similar in effects to crystal meth than it is to cannabis (and after years of smoking it heavily, I agree).\n\nThe progression began slowly, but eventually I stopped attending a single class at university to constantly get high, but my student loan continued to increase as that's how I was funding the habit. After 2.5 years of this, the university finally kicked me out. With nowhere else to turn, I called my parents and told them I had been kicked out (but not mentioning the drugs). After living with them for 6 months, I finally found a job, a really REALLY well paying one. I moved to a new city for this job and began to work.\n\nWell this new found money... was actually enough to pay for all the drugs I could have ever wanted... at least for a while. Eventually my tolerance built up enough so that my income could not cover my needs any more. I began to borrow money and sell my possessions.\n\nObviously this way of obtaining money was unsustainable, and one day, I took my flatmates ps3 and wii off the shelf and took it to a pawn shop. The money from that theft was only enough to last me for 3 days. After those 3 days, my flatmates finally saw what was missing for their house and confronted me. Being the terrible lier I am, I eventually had to admit what I had done, and to prevent them from calling the police, I called my parents, told them about my drug habit and they paid for the ps3 and wii.\n\nMy Dad came and got me, and I went to my family home to recover. After 5 weeks, I had to return to work, and moved into a new flat back in this other city. Well, I never did go back to work, I went back to the drugs, and I hit them hard. I lost my job. My Dad came and got me yet again, and took me home. My Mum by this stage was sick of me, she absolutely hated my guts and wanted me to live on the street, but my Dad was willing to give me a final shot.\n\nWell, I did stay off drugs but it has only been 3 weeks so far.\nA couple of days ago I had to attend court for a charge of \"driving under the influence of drugs\" that I had previously acquired. The courts as it turned out, had no record of me having to be there... the police hadn't filed any paperwork. So I went home, with no conviction, but with the constant threat of an impending arrest in the future once the cops finally got their paperwork sorted.\n\nI muttered something about the constant threat of arrest being just one more stress to add to my life, and somehow this began an argument in my household. It's difficult to remember everything that happened there, but I know that I wasn't being listened to. I called my Dad a fucking retard for not listening, which enraged him so much he tried to drag me outside to fight me. I didn't fight him, I instead ran off... coming back later to yell how upset I was that my own Dad wanted to beat me up. They didn't care... they didn't listen, and I eventually was upset enough to grab a knife and try stab my own wrist... but I chickened out and stabbed a hole into the marble bench top. That was the end. I was kicked out of the home and told to never return.\n\nAll I've ever wanted was to feel loved, and with a family that hates me, I fear I will never feel loved again. \n\nSo here I am, 7pm on Christmas Day at my one and only friends farm house while he is with his family. I have very little money, a pitiful education, no car to drive to a job with, and no money to buy one. My debt stops me from borrowing money to buy a car and my sickness benefit ends in 3 months. After that time is up I will have no income and no way to earn any.\n\nAnd yet, that's not all...\n\nAll I want is to feel loved, and even though my family now hates me and never wants to see me again, you would think that perhaps one day I could start my own family, to love and be loved by... right? Wrong.\n\nI have a condition know as \"micropenis\"... it's exactly what it sounds like. My penis never grew since I was an infant, and is therefore not large enough to have sex with... I can never create a child and have a family. But perhaps that's for the best, because of my other large issue.\n\nYou see, I should probably have killed myself a long time ago... I'm a monster.\n\nI do like woman, I do... it's just... I like little boys more. I'm a pedophile    and though I would never harm a child, I can't help but feel attracted to them.\n\n\nSo there it is: I have no family to love me, and I never will. Even if I get a job, I have no way to drive there and no way to fund a way to drive there, and I'm a pedophile, a total sick fuck who has deserved to die for a long time anyway.\n\n\nThere is a hunting rifle about 20 steps away from where I am now, already loaded and ready to go. But even after everything, I'm still too scared to pull the trigger. I'm sure I will find the courage shortly, but not right now. Right now I'm going to play video games and eat myself into the food sweats.\n\nSoon though... soon.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1tnpvb/im_fucked_up_my_family_hates_me_and_i_have_no/", "title": "I'm fucked up, my family hates me and I have no prospects for my future", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "humbugthrowaway", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1387951648, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1tnpvb/im_fucked_up_my_family_hates_me_and_i_have_no/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426312.320982, "replies_charged": false}
