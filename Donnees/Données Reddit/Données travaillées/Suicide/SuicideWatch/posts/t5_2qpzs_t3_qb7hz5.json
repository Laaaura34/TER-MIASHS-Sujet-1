I sleep all the time, because it's second best to taking my own life, I guess. I think about taking sleeping pills over and over, eventually to the point of dehydration. Or maybe picking up a gun and traveling somewhere beautiful for my final moments.\nI'm just tired of being tired. None of my old hobbies are interesting. I spend too much money. I don't have a job. I don't want to get a job, even though I'm perfectly able-bodied. I don't want to live in this world if I have to be employed to survive. That just doesn't feel like a way to live.\nDoes anyone have any tips on easy to access and painless methods of getting out of here?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qb7hz5/im_just_tired/", "title": "I'm just tired.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sita771", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634633912, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qb7hz5/im_just_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426383.9872732, "replies_charged": false}
