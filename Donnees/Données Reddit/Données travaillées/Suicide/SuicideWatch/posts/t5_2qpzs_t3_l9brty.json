And since then i only pass my time with looking at ceiling and looking to my phone.\n\nI was already got bored at life and used games to make the life less boring but since it's gone i have nothing to do more. I meet people online in my univercity. I even have 1 or 2 new close friends and my grades are amazing. But still,  i'm in consant state of boredom.\n\nJust why should i keep living like that when there is an easy way? Finishing univercity is like 4 years ahead of me which is goddamn long. I don't have anyone to talk to IRL since i live in dysfunctional family. It feels like enduring this boredom doesn't worth. I can just end the boredom.\n\nWhy shouldn't i?\n\nSome notes that i tried really hard to look for a job but living in a 3rd world country, not having diploma and pandemic doesn't help a bit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l9brty/im_in_constant_state_of_boredom_and_see_no_way_out/", "title": "I'm in constant state of boredom and see no way out.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nsinsjsjn", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612097726, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l9brty/im_in_constant_state_of_boredom_and_see_no_way_out/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427015.3612304, "replies_charged": false}
