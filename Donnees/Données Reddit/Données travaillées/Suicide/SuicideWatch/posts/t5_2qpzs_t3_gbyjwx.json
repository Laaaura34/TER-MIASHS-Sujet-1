My mom and dad died and my brothers bones were broken 12 times by the police. Soon later the local gang heard what happened and shot up the entire block. Almost everyone died. After that my younger sister and I moved in with my prostitute aunt. Before I was over at a friends house, spending the night over with my little sister because my aunt got ran over by a bus after she taunted the driver. My friend gave me his phone because his is dying of stage 4 cancer. I would\u2019ve lived with his parents but his father blew up a bus in the name of Allah, he was a terrorist. And the mother killed her self and I had to see the body hanging there from a rope. The house was above the explode because of a gas leak that was rigged to explode at a certain time set by my friends dad. I smelled the gas and tried to run out and grab my sister but it was too late. We both were burned and disabled. I could hardly move my legs. I had hope because my brother was alive but it was later found that he over dosed on A - Class crystal meth. Also my sister died right next to me in the hospital. I am now going to attempt to kill myself. I can no longer take this no more. Goodbye, and if I make it do whatever you can to try and make it worse, so I can slit my wrists harder.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gbyjwx/mother_and_dad_shot_and_killed/", "title": "Mother and dad shot and killed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bbbcmatsercocltewye", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1588387011, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gbyjwx/mother_and_dad_shot_and_killed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426231.3357322, "replies_charged": false}
