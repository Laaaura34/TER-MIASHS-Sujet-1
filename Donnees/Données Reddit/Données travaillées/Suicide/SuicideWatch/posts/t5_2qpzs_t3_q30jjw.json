My worst psychotic episode was three-four years ago and since then I began to take note of the massive cognitive decline that was growing over the years. This is like some progressive dementia in my early adult years, I\u2019m only 19 and I just can\u2019t move on. I had to fucking drop out of college, I can\u2019t draw much, I can\u2019t watch movies, I can\u2019t read, I\u2019m bed ridden. I don\u2019t even have any ability to understand time the past and the future is mixed together and I don\u2019t feel alive in this world, I feel like a shell, I feel like a soul trapped behind a thick glass from the world around me and this is pure torture, it\u2019s over for me, suicides my only option.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q30jjw/never_ending_progressive_cognitive_decline_is/", "title": "Never ending progressive cognitive decline is putting me on the verge of suicide, it won\u2019t matter cause I\u2019m going to probably go brain dead with the way my fucking cognition is declining.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Bulky-Ad1029", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633578230, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q30jjw/never_ending_progressive_cognitive_decline_is/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425449.1147463, "replies_charged": false}
