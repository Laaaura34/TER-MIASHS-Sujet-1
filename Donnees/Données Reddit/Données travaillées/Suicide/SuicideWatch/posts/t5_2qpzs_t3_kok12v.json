I found a suicide letter that I wrote to a friend about 18 months ago, and I don't know how to feel.\n\nI've been depressed for as long as I can remember. As a young child, I was already showing signs of depression. My very first memory is of me self harming at age 3 in preschool after I was unfairly punished for something I had not done, because I was terrified of my parents' reaction upon learning I'd been punished. Both my parents are narcissistic, and I was severely emotionally abused (sometimes, rarely though, physically as well) for most of my life.\n\nI've been diagnosed with severe treatment resistant depression, anxiety, C-PTSD, and ADD. I have a genetic condition that causes constant chronic pain and fatigue, and that's only going to get worse.\n\nI'm originally from Western Europe. During the summer of 2018, I moved to the US (my life long dream) at the age of 24 after I obtained a work visa. I was elated. I was still severely depressed, but I was handling it. But my job soon got terrible: I was working 90 hour weeks, would go months without a day off, was under tremendous pressure and micromanagement, etc. \n\nIn May of 2019, I got fired for an unjust bullshit reason. I'd been down the rabbit hole before, but never that far down. I got my affairs in order, wrote a letter to one of my closest friends, and went out of my way to get some specific drugs. I can't put words on the pain I was feeling. Being able to feel that much pain and not die from it made no sense at all.\n\nWhen I was about to do it, my dog, whom I had adopted just after I moved to the US, grabbed my hand in her mouth in one of her patented mouth hugs. And she just held it there. She held it as I broke down in tears and in a terrible panic attack. She held until I calmed down, and even longer. She held it until the daze was over. Then she gently pulled me from my bedroom to the front door. She let go of my hands and picked up one of her toys, and we went to the dog park. Normally, she didn't play with me T the dog park, she was too busy playing with the other dogs. But that day, she ignored all the other dogs, including her buddies, and stayed by my side. She slept in my bed that night, which was something she never particularly cared for.\n\nShe literally saved my life. After that, things got better for  a while. I found a job I actually loved, with people who were helping me heal a little bit more every day. My dog could come to work with me.\n\nThen she died in my arms in November 2019 after a seizure, because I fucked up her medication. I nearly killed myself again, though it was more of an impulse thing. I nearly drove my car off a cliff. But I couldn't do it, because I didn't want to disappoint my dead dog. \n\nIt's been hard since then. So fucking hard. My visa expired, and I had to leave a place I loved, and people I loved. Thankfully, I was able to obtain a temporary Canadian work visa, which meant I didn't have to go back to my home country (which definitely would have led me to killing myself). But I am so fucking lonely. I have no one. I am no one. I'm not able able create any meaningful bonds with anyone. My dog is dead, and the guilt that I feel over her death haunts me, follows me like a shadow. I'm going down the fuck rabbit hole again.\n\nI was looking for a paper yesterday, and somehow found the suicide not I wrote 18 months ago. I was convinced I'd burnt it. I guess not. But it's been 18 months, and I haven't gotten any better. I guess I haven't gotten worse either, since I'm not actively suicidal at the moment and I don't have a plan.\n\nBut fuck, man, I don't know. What I wrote back then still rings just as true. The pain is still there. If anything, the pain is even worse now that my dog is dead. I don't know what to feel. I've tried therapy, different kinds, different therapists, different meds, nothing makes a difference. I'm scared that I'm so broken that I can never be made better. Made whole again. That I am simply, completely, and utterly unable of ever being happy. That my brain is just not programed for it. 18 months, and nothing has changed. I don't know what to think. I don't know what to feel. I don't even know if there is a person beyond the depression, beyond the anxiety, beyond the trauma, or if it's all I am. Because it's been what I am for so long, now it's all I can ever be. I don't know if there's anything to save at all, let alone anything worth saving. I just don't fucking know.\n\n18 months, and I haven't been able to dig myself out of the rabbit hole.
