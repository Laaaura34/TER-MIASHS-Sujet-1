I took the baby with me to drop my son off at school today, and we hung out in the livingroom for the morning so the house was quiet and he could get some much needed rest. \n\nI've been so inside my head lately. I don't really want to be alive right now, it hurts and I constantly feel like my life isn't worth it. I went to my midwife, she confirmed I have post partum. She said there isn't much she can do. It feels like there is never much anyone can do. He knew this, he knows I've been feeling suicidal. He came out in a great mood, and I was sad. He got angry with me and I asked him to leave me alone because I didn't want to be yelled at anymore, he then said fuck you several times and gave me the finger in anger. He told me I treat him poorly because I would not look at him. I just.. I don't feel anything right now. I know I am worthless. \n\nI don't even feel human right now. I'm just expected to be okay and I'm not fucking okay. I'm alone and I don't want to do this anymore.\n\nI really don't want to be alive anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/plplj7/he_didnt_like_the_mood_i_was_in/", "title": "He didn't like the mood I was in.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rezerdeee", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631294881, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/plplj7/he_didnt_like_the_mood_i_was_in/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427605.0004022, "replies_charged": false}
