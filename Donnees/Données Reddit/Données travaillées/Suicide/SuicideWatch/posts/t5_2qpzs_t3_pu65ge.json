For some reason this all fell through the roof once tumblr(made me form temporary anorexia), Instagram, and sex work platforms popped into the equation. The comparison became so much I began using my phone 5 hours per day. I compulsively began figuring out how I can look like these girls. I started getting fillers, wanting nose jobs etc. my relationships are unstable. I\u2019m not going to work. Im crying all the time. Ive stalked all my bfs pages only to be disgruntled by what I saw. It\u2019s embarrassing but it\u2019s ruined my life and this weekend I\u2019m buying a flip phone hoping it might change my life and stop me from having so many suicidal thoughts. It\u2019s made me become shamefully violent, out of control emotionally and fearful of relationships with other females who are pretty. I know people go through similar feelings but I think I have taken this to a whole new level.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pu65ge/social_media_and_suicidal_thoughts_self/", "title": "Social media and suicidal thoughts/ self destruction", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "No-Cupcake-9776", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632435615, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pu65ge/social_media_and_suicidal_thoughts_self/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422248.49099, "replies_charged": false}
