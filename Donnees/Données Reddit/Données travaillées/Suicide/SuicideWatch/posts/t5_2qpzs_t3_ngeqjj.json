Cut of my wrists and let the sadness bleed out of my chest trough my wound.... its hurting like hell and im feeling that theses impulses is getting stronger each time....\n\nim 24, we started our relationship with 16 in the highschool in diferent cities 600km apart from each other, and still we made it work. We were the first romantic relation of each other and we both were depressed at the time and she was too inclined to suicide so i made myself stronger and bigger to hold her, and promised that i would reach her, and she didnt believe it.  \nI damaged my relations with my family so i could aply to a college in her city, studied my ass off while been awake every night to make her company, and to watch for her (we used skype a lot), and i made it... So against my family, the rest of friends that left me, against all odds, i went to a huge city (i ever lived in a small country city) to be with her.  \nShe struglled a lot with social interactions and with a lot of problems with her familly. We studied in the same university and i aply to a course that i wasnt even that intersted but that would make me some money more certainly to let her aply to a course that SHE WANTED to.  \nI managed to escape some classes so i could be with her in her break times, and that made me lost a year of my course....  \nDuring these 8 years i fought to free her, her family used her like a maid every single day and even refuse her to let out. Her folks impose rules that only allow us to be together 4 hous a week in some months, and still the one who fought against all this was me, for her, because she needed, because she asked, and because she said that love me.  \nEvery single day she said that she loved me, and that it was for ever and after some time, years, i believed....  \nSo i bought our wedding rings.... asked her hand and she said YES, and not the kind of yes when you are doubtfull but with a huge smile and tears.  \nWe both finished college, i had to go back to my homecity because we both dreamed to live in a more peacefull city to create our family.  And she came to pass some time with my parents, during the celebrations of the end of the year.  \nShe went back to her city in january and we were both with the same line of tought of work and get a house here and then move.  \nI started study like the hell to pass the bar (im from brazil and the test where suspended for the last year because of the pandemy).  \nIn her birthday i bough a huge pack of candies and chocolates that she like togeter with a letter of love, and three days after this in the night she said to me that she was doubtfull of our wedding and dont know anymore if she wanted. We talked a lot in the next day and everything seemed to be solved, she seemed to be happy.... and i believed in her...  \nThree days ago in the morning she broke up with me, for no reason.... it wasnt another love in her life, or anything like that she just said that she dindt love me anymore and that was it. She stopped talk to me, stopped our videocalls, stopped everything and when i try to know more she seems distant, cold, like another person, and made sure we're done.\n\nEverything seems akward, and i just wish that i had died before she did that to me, because this way at least i would die believing it was real, the love i felt and still feel is real. i gave her my heart my soul my everything and fought the world to be with her and help her and now i was just left abandoned... i really thinking in suicide right now and i know isnt the right thing but i cant help the need to stop this endless pain", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ngeqjj/i_lost_a_relationship_that_last_8_years_and_with/", "title": "I Lost a relationship that last 8 years, and with it all my dreams and effort and soul together and now i just dont know and dont want to be alive anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rodrigoobl", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621452589, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ngeqjj/i_lost_a_relationship_that_last_8_years_and_with/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425182.677193, "replies_charged": false}
