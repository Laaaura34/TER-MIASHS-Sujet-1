I tried to make everything better but it\u2019s hard. Attempted self harm multiple times but I can\u2019t help but get scared to get caught. I just want people to leave me alone. But I can\u2019t help but feel guilty every time they talk about me. Like how my mom is a single mother trying to raise me alone. At this point, I don\u2019t fucking care anymore. I pity other people instead of my self. I\u2019m always afraid that people talk about me. Everyday is a mental torture. People never pitied me, or asked if I was okay. No one cared about me genuinely. Now that I don\u2019t need them, they keep meddling in my life. I\u2019ve kept all of my feelings inside, act like a good daughter like everybody knew i was. I\u2019m mad, fucking mad that I want to scratch my skin until it bleeds. I feel so terrible. I hate it. I hate everything. I always have to act nice because of people guilt tripping me. Oh yeah i almost forgot that my mom monitors everything i do. Including my social media accounts, I feel like im being watched every day. I cant take it anymore. I do all my efforts in studying, get good grades yet it still wasnt enough. Every thing felt nothing.
