This is a wonderful community \n\nI\u2019m 16 at the moment and I\u2019ve come to realise that nothing is going to get better. Everyone says \u201cthese are the best years of your life\u201d and that just leads me to believe that everything just gets worse after I surpass the age of 20 or some shit. I don\u2019t want to live in a world where I\u2019m struggling everyday for no reason whatsoever. I plan to just end it either at 20 or just before. I\u2019ve had this plan for a while and I\u2019ve treated it as such a common subject that the thought of suicide doesn\u2019t phase me anymore.\n\nMy reasoning behind all of this is because I\u2019m just a downright horrible piece of shit. I\u2019ve broken so many friendships because of how I acted and I honestly don\u2019t know why people like me. I\u2019ve been bullied so much that I don\u2019t see a future for myself. I don\u2019t see anything past 20. So I believe that\u2019s where it ends. I don\u2019t know what the hell to do. It\u2019s not like anyone would care if I was gone anyway", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q6mk0k/no_one_knows_about_my_plan_for_suicide_or_the/", "title": "No one knows about my plan for suicide.
