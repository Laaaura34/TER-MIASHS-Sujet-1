Do you think they even care that telling somone something like \"it won't stop the pain it will only make more for other people\" or \"think about what this would do to your loved ones\" is not helpful, or is it just about making themselves feel good for their minor performative act? You're not a hero for making a suicidal person feel like shit.\n\nEvery time I see one of those comments it makes me feel physically sick, knowing that i could hurt anyone else even a little bit. It shoves that very real guilt that i was *already feeling* down my throat so i feel like i can no longer express those feelings without risking upsetting even more people. Now I'm seriously weighing up if i would cause more damage alive or not. I crawl in on myself and stew in my own self hatred until I just spiral out of control. I just wanted to talk about it, but now I feel more alone and disconnected from reality than ever. I live alone right now and have no acquaintances living antwhere near me. I go months without making eyecontact with another human being and only speak on the phone. I did not need a reason to isolate myself further.\n\ngod why does the internet have to fucking suck so much.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m613hx/i_hate_guilt_trips/", "title": "i hate guilt trips", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kcowleries", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 29, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615869457, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m613hx/i_hate_guilt_trips/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426201.6462715, "replies_charged": false}
