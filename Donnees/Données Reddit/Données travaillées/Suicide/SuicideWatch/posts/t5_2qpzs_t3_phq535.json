I don't understand why we couldn't have worked things out if they loved me as much as I loved them. I would've done anything to make our relationship better. They seemed so happy one minute and then the next they didn't want me anymore. I don't understand why we can't rekindle something new. I don't want to be here. I don't want to be alone. Everyone keeps telling me I just miss the idea of them, but I don't think so. I miss them. As a person. The good things and the bad things. They were my girlfriend and my best friend, and I hate that I'm mourning someone who is still alive. Someone who didn't care when I was all broken up inside but now after months of apathy suddenly feels the same as I did when they first destroyed me. I hate that I feel like I'm back to square one. I feel so lost. I don't wanna do this anymore, but I will, because I have to.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/phq535/i_want_to_die_again/", "title": "I want to die again.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "stabbyopossum", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630756308, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/phq535/i_want_to_die_again/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426754.1442242, "replies_charged": false}
