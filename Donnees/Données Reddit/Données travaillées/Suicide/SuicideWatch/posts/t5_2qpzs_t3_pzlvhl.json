I can't imagine myself living for 5 more years even less for 40 or more (ugh just writing it makes me anxious). I cannot bring myself to suicide because I'm terrified of surviving and if I could choose, I would love to die in an accident so that people don't think they could have any control over it. But then I see how much compassion people with terminal diseases receive and how families heal under the idea that the deceased is \"in a better place\". And so I'm actively doing things that are right at the border between being harmful and lethal, with the hope that my life expectancy drops by at least 15 or 20 years. At this point I don't even care about the suffering. To be honest I think I deserve to suffer so whatever route my body takes is fine. There's a part of my brain that wonders if I will ever regret this. The same part that tries to believe that I could heal. But then I remember how I've been depressed for over 15 years and how unfair it is that I can't choose to die and I keep doing it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pzlvhl/decreasing_my_life_expectancy/", "title": "Decreasing my life expectancy", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "deathoflink", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633138896, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pzlvhl/decreasing_my_life_expectancy/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635422993.079889, "replies_charged": false}
