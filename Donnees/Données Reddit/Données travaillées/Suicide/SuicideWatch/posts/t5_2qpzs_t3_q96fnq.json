Then again, If I don't have them in my room, I'm afraid I'll only go looking for them later, which might make me feel more determine to actually do it, or I might find something else to hurt myself with that's even more dangerous, which I'll actually be able to go through with too. I feel might be worse if I move them from such a close location to me? I don't know if I should remove them or keep them.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q96fnq/i_have_razorblades_hidden_near_my_bed_and_i_dont/", "title": "I have razorblades hidden near my bed and I don't know if I should keep them there or remove them", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SaintJuvia", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634365631, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q96fnq/i_have_razorblades_hidden_near_my_bed_and_i_dont/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425559.0997648, "replies_charged": false}
