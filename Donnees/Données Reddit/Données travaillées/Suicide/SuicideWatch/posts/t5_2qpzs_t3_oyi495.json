The last time I tried killing myself was by having anorexia and bulimia and I would've continued but it eventually affected my studies so I had to stop and retreat to help from the internet. I'm fine now it's been a long time since that happened (I did lose my menstrual cycle) but there are many specific reasons on why all these people just drive me nuts and drain my motivation to live away that I want to kill myself. I wish I had someone to talk to about this but I lost touch with friends and I can't talk to a therapist because I can't afford it. I know I'm talking bluntly about it but I am desperate to talk to anyone at the moment about this issue.\n\nEdit: I don't know if I'm to blame for all the mess that occurs in my family or whether it's because my mom is toxic and abusive.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oyi495/i_want_to_kill_myself_because_of_my_mom_family/", "title": "I want to kill myself because of my mom, family, and relatives", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "The_Earth_is_sexy", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628171911, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oyi495/i_want_to_kill_myself_because_of_my_mom_family/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422260.5639637, "replies_charged": false}
