Im healthy, has a job that i supposedly love, married, basically a stable life. My dad passed away recently and it triggered this void that i used to have years ago but more 'profound' in a way. I now have this understanding that nothing actually worth anything, one day we will all enter the afterlife with nothing at all. Joy is temporary, pleasure is shortlived. I dont know anymore the purpose of most activities, even eating. What is keeping me from entering the next stage is the guilt that it would bring my mother and husband. Are most of us like this? Staying here not because we want to live but afraid of the impact of our action on others? I can understand how people could have a suicide pact with their loved ones now.. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6on6mc/life_is_supposed_to_be_good/", "title": "Life is Supposed to be Good", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ladygoldsmith", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1500634717, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6on6mc/life_is_supposed_to_be_good/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427728.4442446, "replies_charged": false}
