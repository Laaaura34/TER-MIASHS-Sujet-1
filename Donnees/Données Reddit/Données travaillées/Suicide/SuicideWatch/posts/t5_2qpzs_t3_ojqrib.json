People don't care how it makes me feel. They have all their friends and family. I have no one.\n\nAll people need to hear is that everyone else hates me, too. That's enough reason for them to hate me as well.\n\nIf they could hear my story, I'm sure they'd understand. But they don't want to hear. Once they have made up their mind, there is nothing I can say.\n\nIt seems that the only way to have a social life is to pretend I'm fine but I'm not. As soon as I drop the act, they all leave. But it kills me inside all the same. Knowing how fast people will turn against you. Why do I even bother when it always ends the same?\n\nOnly my mother and sister would mourn me if I was gone. Even my brother doesn't care. All men in my life seem to hate me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ojqrib/no_one_wants_to_be_friends_with_an_outcast/", "title": "No one wants to be friends with an outcast", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RainyPathGoat", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 26, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626215756, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ojqrib/no_one_wants_to_be_friends_with_an_outcast/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426780.3761826, "replies_charged": false}
