I don\u2019t even know what I do wrong I just feel like people automatically hate me. I can\u2019t conversate if my life depended on it (which right now it\u2019s kind of feeling like it does). It feels like I walk into a social setting and everyone\u2019s speaking a language I don\u2019t understand. Imagine you\u2019re sitting in a group with a bunch of people and they\u2019re all speaking Korean and you\u2019re just there nodding your head smiling awkwardly. You think they\u2019re talking bad about you. You have no clue what to say. My mind is just blank and I\u2019m silent. I think about suicide 24 hours a day 365 days a year. When I\u2019m at work, school, doing groceries, at the drive thru in McDonald\u2019s, when I wake up, when I go to bed, all day every day I think about blowing my brains out with a .45 hollow point or 12-gauge shotgun in the woods where nobody would let me survive and a helicopter can\u2019t take me to the hospital in time to revive me. I don\u2019t have anything against anyone I don\u2019t have any hate for anybody other than myself. I\u2019m the problem. I\u2019m the one that has to change. I have acquaintances I talk to every few days briefly or so. I\u2019ve told these acquaintances how I really feel and we have a short conversation where they show me pity and then never check up on me or ask to hang out. Which in hindsight I feel like this was a really stupid idea because why would I open up that deep to an acquaintance someone I barely know. I probably made them feel fucking horrible for something they have nothing to do with. Them never hitting me up makes me feel worse because I think that they\u2019re thinking I\u2019m some psychopath they want to avoid. I worry so much about what people think of me. Any small judgement or comment even from a stranger I take it extremely serious on myself and I\u2019ll overthink about it for days. \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with me?\u201d Is the question I ask myself every single day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/psbbuf/i_hate_myself_more_than_any_other_human_being_on/", "title": "I hate myself more than any other human being on this planet", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Downawful", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 189, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632198097, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/psbbuf/i_hate_myself_more_than_any_other_human_being_on/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635423122.1922872, "replies_charged": false}
