I'm 26, trans and bi as fuck, and i just finalized my suicide plan.\n\nA bit of backstory, for those who care to know. My first two memories I really can remember are getting a fist fight where a girl ripped enough flesh out of my arm to need stitches and writing my first suicide note. I knew, at 8, that I wasn't cut out for this whole living thing. I have been poor all my life. My parents couldn't afford rent, so we had to move in with my child molester/spouse abuser grandfather, who my dad killed. In our house. When I was 10. With my mother's recently deceased brother's handgun that she got in his will. My dad did a lot of meth and was a physically abusive shitbag, but also was the only person in my entire family who gave a shit about me and was my best friend, cause I was a weird chubby kid who liked Rocky Horror and Xfiles and wasn't well liked by other kids. Anyway, at the court hearing for that I got taken to foster care and had to smile at my collapsing crying mother and tell her I was just going to sleep away camp. My sister, also taken to foster care with me, threw a chair at a pregnant police officer and I had to talk us out of further trouble. When I finally saw my dad again he told me I had to be the man of the house and take care of our family. I then tried to commit suicide for the first time at 11. And then again at 23.  \n\n\nFast forward 26, I haven't spoken to most of my family in years, I am recently out of 9 years of community college (after getting in trouble with my mother for graduating high school 2 years early, cause college is expensive) that I have put myself through with 10 years of working (often multiple jobs at a time), all to be better? To get somewhere? To rise above my shitty family's station? To be able to live a life that would make me want to live? I'm not really sure anymore. I am bitter and tired and after all this work, and all of the dreams I have given up in order to do all of that work. I am facing homeless for the second time in my life since I became and adult. I apply to 10+ jobs a day, but I am at risk due to heart and lung problems if I end up working front lines during the corona virus. I have finally gotten correctly medicated just before losing my job at the school (due to corona virus), and yet the more I like myself the more sure I am of my suicide.  \n\n\nIt used to be that when I hurt myself, or in my attempts, it was always pushed forward by my own deep self hatred, but added to by this matter-of-fact feeling that I just wasn't meant to live. Like if I was, then why has my whole fuckin life just been such shit? If I was meant to live, why am I completely incapable of connecting to other people?  I have friends, don't get me wrong. I am popular even. Well liked, with a long and healthy dating history. But instead of any of these friendships or connections making me even the slightest bit happy, I just hit a wall of anxiety and self criticsim any time anyone is nice to me. I hide well, and I am great at making these immediate friends, but I never feel connected to anyone else. And now, that I'm medicated, it seems all the self-hate has fallen away, but the matter of fact feeling that I would be better off dead is only stronger than ever. No man is an island and all, but I am no man, so I should get to go die in my island of solitude.  \n\n\nAnyway, this is all longer than I wanted it to be. Didn't mean to go on for so long, but I guess I wanted someone to hear me before I depart down the river styx. I'm saving up the last bit of money I need to buy a gun, I'll hang around and join a gun club and go shooting with my friends so no one worries, then, once I'm sure no one is going to come looking, I am going to take the full bottle of xanax I have, finish it off with the bottle of nice whiskey I've been saving, smoke the rest of my weed, and blow my fucking brains out. I live in a garage in a shitty part of town, there are dudes on the other side of my wall that have lit two fires in the street in a meth'd out shit faze, and my roommates go out of town pretty regularly. No one will notice the gunshot. Even if I somehow don't die from the bullet (though I am planning to make sure I do, hence the gun training), by the time my roommates get back from whatever camping trip or beach day or what have you, I will have bled out. Peacefully. To make up for all the peace I never got in life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for hearing me out suicide watchers.
