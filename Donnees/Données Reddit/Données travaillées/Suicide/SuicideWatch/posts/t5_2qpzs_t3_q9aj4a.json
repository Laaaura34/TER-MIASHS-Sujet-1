So twice now, a couple months ago and last year I cut my wrists with the hope I\u2019d die from it. I don\u2019t know if this actually counts as a suicide attempt though, because the cuts were far too shallow to cause death, which I knew at the time, but I still wished I would bleed out. \n\nThe reason I couldn\u2019t go deeper is because it hurt too much (so stupid I know). I told no one at the time, the cuts healed by themselves and the scars left are very small, I felt fine afterwards so there was clearly no chance it would be serious. \n\nSince I knew the cuts weren\u2019t nearly deep enough to do any damage, but I still really wanted to die from them, would these instances be called an attempted suicide or just self harm?\n\nNote: I don\u2019t need advice or help or anything, I\u2019ve talk through this a with friends and am slowly getting better :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9aj4a/what_counts_as_a_suicide_attempt/", "title": "What counts as a suicide attempt?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ReasonablyGoodToast", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634385287, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9aj4a/what_counts_as_a_suicide_attempt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428517.5222287, "replies_charged": false}
