Each time they pop up sometimes they are so strong I cannot think of anything else but suicide no matter how hard I try. I don't have any friends of note and the only person in my life that truly cares about me is my mother but she is unaware of the severity of my situation. \n\nI think now is the right time to end it all, I'm not really emotional about it I think it's just better if I wasn't around. Could someone honestly tell me the best way to hang myself or poison myself?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n9jfvc/very_strong_suicidal_ideation_and_urges/", "title": "very strong suicidal ideation and urges", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sully_2001", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620689902, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n9jfvc/very_strong_suicidal_ideation_and_urges/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427274.2228763, "replies_charged": false}
