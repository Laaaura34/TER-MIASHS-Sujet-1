I have thought about how much I'd like to die at least once a day for years now. But in recent months the frequency of such thoughts, length of time spent on them(or distracting myself from them), and the pleasure I feel at the thought of everything just *ending* has increased. A lot.\n\nI haven't killed myself simply because I don't want to die before my mother. Most parents don't want their kids to pass away before them, after all. But at some point today I found myself just not caring about even that. Didn't last long, but...well. I may not be long for this world if that becomes a recurring thing.\n\nTo that end I thought of doing *something* to curb my suicidal thoughts, and the first suggestion I see is to talk to either family members or the suicide hotline. And while I may do that I really can't see what someone could say to make me value my life when I've been *looking forward to my death* since I was a kid.\n\nSo, anyone here try this approach?
