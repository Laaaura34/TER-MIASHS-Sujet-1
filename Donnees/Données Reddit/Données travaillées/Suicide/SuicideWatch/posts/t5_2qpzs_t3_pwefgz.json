I was diagnosed again in January of this year at a mental hospital. I feel like a lot of people are afraid to talk about this, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m an alcoholic and a drug addict. I am tired of drinking and doing drugs. But, drugs and alcohol are cheaper than therapy and I am able to feel better instantly. I am poor. I don\u2019t have insurance. The last time I went to a free rehab, I got pregnant. I was told I was \u201ctoo smart\u201d for AA. And I don\u2019t want to join a cult. I\u2019m desperate at this point and would rather be stupid. Id rather be stupid and happy\u2026maybe. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m capable of choosing to sacrifice my individuality for sobriety. I really don\u2019t like being sober. I wish that I felt comfortable being myself without drugs or alcohol\u2026. But it\u2019s just so hard for me to see a life without those things. I\u2019m a ticking time bomb. It\u2019s only a matter of time before I kill myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwefgz/trying_to_find_a_solution_i_dont_want_to_die/", "title": "Trying to find a solution.
