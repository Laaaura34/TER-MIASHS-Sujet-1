I just want the pain to stop, and only a relationship can help, I'm deadset on it, currently speaking to someone 80 miles away but I keep having doubts as her responses are not the best and she doesn't show any affection anymore. I gave up awhile ago and now there's only 2 ways I'm coming out of this, in a body bag or with someone,  either is a win for me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o4hgkt/been_thinking_about_it_for_too_long/", "title": "Been thinking about it for too long", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AverageAntique3160", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624230480, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o4hgkt/been_thinking_about_it_for_too_long/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427745.615858, "replies_charged": false}
