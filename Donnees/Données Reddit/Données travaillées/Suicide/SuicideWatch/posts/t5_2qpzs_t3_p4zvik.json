That's the extent of my love life. Besides that, I've never had any indication that I'm desirable in any way.\n\nNow that I've dropped out of school I basically have no way to meet women. Not like it would matter, though. It's not like I have anything that I can offer.\n\nI just feel so empty inside knowing that I've already missed out on so much, in regards to dating and relationships. Every day I mourn the time that I feel I've wasted not being with someone who cares about me.\n\nI feel like I've written enough at this point to justify posting this. The only part that really matters is the title though. Posting this will probably be a mistake, but we'll see.\n\nI posted this on r/dating and they permabanned me for it, so I guess I'll try here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p4zvik/why_shouldnt_i_kill_myself_if_ill_never_find_love/", "title": "Why Shouldn't I Kill Myself if I'll Never Find Love?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dbow_and_arrow", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629055292, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p4zvik/why_shouldnt_i_kill_myself_if_ill_never_find_love/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426772.1780105, "replies_charged": false}
