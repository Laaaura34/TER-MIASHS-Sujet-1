I am a 21 year old male, I\u2019ve struggled with depression and borderline debilitating insomnia my whole life.  I\u2019ve never really sought treatment until a few months ago.  I\u2019ve been low before but this time it feels like I\u2019m too low to come out\u2026. I am curious if anyone has resources for someone in my position to get in touch with a therapist or something.  I am writing this message so obviously part of me wants to survive, but if that instinct is there it is purely subconscious because I cannot think of a reason to continue going on.\n\nJust to give an idea of all the horrible things going on in my life\n\nI just got my dream job\n\nI live with my girlfriend and my best friend\n\nI am in a better financial spot than I have been in years\n\nI finally felt like I had identified how I want to spend the rest of my life, and career.\n\nWhat the f*** is wrong with me, I need help.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qd11d0/any_solid_resources/", "title": "Any solid resources?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NeverOuttaTheWoods", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634849183, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qd11d0/any_solid_resources/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426517.3032372, "replies_charged": false}
