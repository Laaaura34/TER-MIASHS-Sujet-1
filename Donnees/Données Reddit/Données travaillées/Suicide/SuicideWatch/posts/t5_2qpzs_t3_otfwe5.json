But now I think this is it. I had an abortion and I feel really guilty and I lied to everyone and told them I had a miscarriage but now it's catching up to me. I'm facing academic exclusion because I've failed so many classes and I feel like I'm going nowhere, fast. I'm poor so I have no choice but to make it and that's a lot of pressure. I hate who I've become and I used to feel sympathy for my family (that's what would make me not want to do it) How they would feel, how  shattered they would be but now I feel nothing. All I say to myself is, \"they'll understand\", and it kinda worries me that I just I'm impartial like that. I've been crying for hours and I just can't stop - it feels like something is stuck in my throat.\n\nI hate that I'm back in this position because I know I can do better but I don't know how.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/otfwe5/thought_i_wouldnt_but/", "title": "Thought I Wouldn't but...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "alwaysunny01", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627496966, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/otfwe5/thought_i_wouldnt_but/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427104.369547, "replies_charged": false}
