The one before that 2 years prior I choked. What\u2019s the point of being around if all I do is hurt people. The first thing I ever saw was violence against woman from my dad and yet I perpetuated the same cycle! It was the one thing I never wanted I shyed away from relationships and women in general for years out of fear of it and I can\u2019t live with myself now that it\u2019s happened, twice! The EMDR doesn\u2019t do shit, I trained MMA for years to get anger under control after the first time, clearly didn\u2019t work only equipped me with more ways to hurt people. I\u2019m 23 soon, No job, no lisence/car, no friends in this city which I moved to for her. I\u2019m fucking done not just living with my mental state but physical one even when I was fit I\u2019m still a 5\u20198 manlet, with hands and dick so small no wonder I never pleased a woman with them. Tell me what the point is when there\u2019s already enough fucking pain, trauma and disappointment in the world without me furthering it\n\nUpdate: I'm done. thanks for the support but I don't see any point continuing, nobody has any tangible answers. My ex can't forgive me I can't forgive myself, I'm too scared of hurting somebody and mentally fucked to even communicate with people. She doesn't care if I die so I may as well go splat myself where we used to walk. Life is meaningless especially when everything you do is done better by other people.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/njg320/cant_live_with_the_guilt_anymore/", "title": "Can\u2019t live with the guilt anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Doweis", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621800823, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/njg320/cant_live_with_the_guilt_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426190.1742988, "replies_charged": false}
