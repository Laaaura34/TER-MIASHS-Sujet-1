While they continue to make digs on my page, I notice this user is also planning their suicide in other reddit and online communities. They claim to have a popular drug for their preferred method. They are active in incel communities that support suicidal behavior and fuel all kinds of madness for themselves and others.\n\nPeople would like to help, and although I've reported it to authorities per reddit's guidelines, it appears this person continues to suffer. It's getting worse as time goes by. I've sent them links to your group and other support links mentioned on the reddit what to do page, but again, not helping. I don't know how all this tech works, and what is realistic considering the limitations that apply. \n\nI would like this person to get help. Yeah, the harassment is annoying, but it's basically on repeat and so senseless that again, I am seriously concerned.
