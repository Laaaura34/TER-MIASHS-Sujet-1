I am heartbroken. I'm addicted to drugs. I don't care about myself, and I simultaneously think I'm just so important. So important I'm willing to traumatize so many people just to get away from myself. I hate this whole fucking knot of a life. I hate the confusion. I wish I could just give up. I never realized how close I could get. \n\nI wish she still loved me. It's the most painful piece of truth. She was the one thing that made things okay. The way I could lay in her lap. Now she doesn't want me to. And she's right. What the fuck am I. What the fuck have I become. Have I ever even been something else. You know how evil I am? She's the person I love most genuinely and purely in the world, and I still want her to be with me. I know how evil I am. I know how much of a mess I am. I know it fucking ruins her. Yet I want it. Because I am evil. The funny thing is they all don't want me to kill myself, yet for me to accept it all, i'll have to be a different person anyway. There are parts of me this has attached to that are too fundamental to remove without removing m the rest. So what's the fucking difference anyway. I'm going to die. my heart hurts so much and who knows what it means. Am i just being evil? Is this just the stupid fucking functions, the stupid fucking lies to convince me to reproduce? i hate it all. i hate it all and i want it fucking go away.\n\nAnd now I'm dropping out again. The failures. The faces of disappointment as they try to hide it and replace it with sympathy. The money wasted from parents' money. All the treatment, for what, for this? Good job. And I have no excuse. I have had so many privileges. So much luck. So many opportunities. And I fucked them all up. It's not unfair, it's my fault. \n\nThat's the part of it that is just so clear. I am not a victim. I am the reason for it. I have no excuse, I simply choose not to. So what the fuck is the fucking point. I am fucking evil. I think terrible things about people I love. I give them feelings that are awful. And I can't even tell if the reason I feel bad about it is because if I didn't look like I cared, I couldn't manipulate them more and keep getting away with doing nothing, putting no effort into myself.\n\nThe only thing I have left is meth. Crystal fucking meth. What a man I've grown into. And the pathetic thing is that it works. Since she's been gone, it's the only thing that makes it seem worth doing anything. Who cares about my withering body. My loose teeth. My bloodshot eyes. Fuck it. It'll be decomposing soon enough. Fuck it. I can't believe how much I used to care. I can't believe I thought it fucking mattered. Waste it away.\n\nAnd now I'm leaving to go back home, and all hope of being with her is gone. Oh god, oh god, how could I ever pretend to move on? I'm still bruised from my ex-girlfriend cheating on me in high school, fucking 4 years ago. It still fucks me up, just like i knew it would the day i found out. so weak. Why didn't I just do it back then. Now if I kill myself she'll know it was her 'fault.' As if. It's her lack of faults that makes her clear headed enough to know to stay away. But fuck, fuck, fuck fuck, how much it hurts to feel her push me away. Yet I can't blame her. But it fucking hurts.I could do my best to make it seem related to the debt but it won't work, she'll be fucked up by it. FUCK these stupid FUCKING people who care about me, I'm sorry mom, I'm sorry papa, i'm sorry and i promise it wasn't your fault. \n\nnothing left, nothing left, nothing but a bowl of meth. i'm spinning, it can only feel so good for so long. But burn through those fucking neurons and leave the shards behind I don't give a fuck.\n\nI just want it to end, and I'm so fucking scared it won't. I know there won't be hell or heaven, but I'm pretty sure there is experience after death. I just want to go away, it's so excausting.. but it odn'est look like it will. Let's hope it removes all the human structure, every single part of it, please pleaes plesae. i'll blow my brains out and it wont be able to do anything to me any more. please. \nit's so pathetically arrogant to even hit post. but here i am. now i have to write the disclaimers so i don't look like i'm juist being for attention, even though i am, even though i always will be because i can't hold her as we sleep any more. now it's someone else. it's someone else. it's hopeless.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bbxoub/it_is_such_a_mess/", "title": "it is such a mess", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway58858858", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1554973950, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bbxoub/it_is_such_a_mess/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426278.427243, "replies_charged": false}
