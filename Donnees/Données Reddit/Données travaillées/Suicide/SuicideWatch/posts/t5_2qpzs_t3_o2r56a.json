I\u2019ve spent all my childhood and teenage years without the things I wanted. I never had (and I still don\u2019t have) the things I wanted\u2026 I was always forced to have the basic. What about the things I could never have ? The parties I could never go ? The clothes I could never wear ? The trips I could never take ? The house I could never have ? The bedroom with a view to the ghetto I was given ? All those things I could never have HURT me in a way ppl could never imagine. My family gave me unhappiness and sorrows, they mistreated in every single way, they were never there when I most needed them, I was and keep being poor and they want me to consider them as \u201cmy family ?\u201d Gimme a fucking break. Y\u2019all gave me all the problems I have, don\u2019t expect me to have consideration. Y\u2019all were the people supposed to take care of me yet you were the responsible for my failure, sorrows and disappointments.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o2r56a/we_are_your_family_oh_yeah_then/", "title": "\u201cWe are your family.\u201d Oh yeah ?
