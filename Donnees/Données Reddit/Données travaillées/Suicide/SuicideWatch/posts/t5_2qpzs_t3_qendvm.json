He's been staying there since his girlfriend broke up with him and he lost his apartment. The friend who's house he's staying at is my other best friend and former roommate. We lost our apartment when the pandemic laid us off so he moved in with his girlfriend and I unfortunately went back to my parents house. Us 3 have been best friends since 5th grade, we're 25 now just for some background.\n\nMy other friend wasn't home yet from work so we just leaned up against his car and talked. We're both at the lowest points in our lives admittedly. Not much going for us at this point. I know misery loves company but it's more like he knows I'd be one of the few people who'd understand how he feels about life right now. And it helps just to get it out sometimes but last night still has me messed up honestly and losing hope.\n\nWe have some overlap in our issues/reasons for considering suicide. We both struggle with substance abuse, he's much worse off in that regard but likely his break up accelerated that. I've opened up to him about me having Borderline Personality Disorder and my suicide attempts and traumas and he's done the same and shared with me his struggles with Schizophrenia, ADHD and mainly his struggle with his dad commiting suicide once he got diagnosed with cancer when we were in 8th grade. I'm only child so him and my other best friend are like my brothers and I want to help them in any way I could but how can I when everything is so fucked in our lives. \n\nI'm not going to get into the specifics about everything we talked about but we ended on with what we value most. Being genuine was what we agreed the most on, something sorely lacking in our society. Then our other friend pulled up and he finished his cigarette and we went inside and tried to have a good night. We mosty just kept chatting but about more light hearted or just anything else.\n\nBut he seemed like he had his mind made up on either leaving the state and just going anywhere else because he had no other ties here besides us or moving out from our friends house and ending it. I felt like I definitely didn't encourage him but how am going to comfort my best friend when I'm at my lowest too and am considering it as well more and more lately again. He's at the brink though and I guess I'm just holding out hope like an idiot at this point. Maybe I'm stuck remembering how things used to be. When we were in highschool and shortly after. Things were rough but we had so many good times and not everything had collapsed in our lives despite best efforts.\n\nLong ass post so I'm sorry for that but I just don't know anymore. I've let him know he's like a brother to me and gone over all the real talk conversations anyone could have. I'm just getting this all out there at like 3 am because I can't sleep. I don't know what anyone could offer as advice or anything necessarily. I didn't even go into my own personal struggles, that'd be a whole other post.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qendvm/i_dont_know_what_to_say_i_had_a_heart_to_heart/", "title": "I don't know what to say.
