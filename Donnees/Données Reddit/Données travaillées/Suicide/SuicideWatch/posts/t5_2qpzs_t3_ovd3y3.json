I wonder how long my heart and liver will last. I'm 22 years old, and have been a raging alcoholic since the age of 17.\n\nI drink in hope of reaching a state of apathy in which I can gather the necessary impulse to off myself. I'm already apathetic towards life and all that it may entail as I've realized years ago that life is but a state of consciousness forced to endure a set of events that prove pointless in the face of our interpretation of logic; namely the concept of uncertainty and the \"fact\" that we know nothing of our \"reality\". I possess the necessary mental faculties to realize that my personal life holds no prospects that would lead my human coil to a feeling of satisfaction and fulfilment. So why bother prolonging this existence of mine, when it's most certainly going to bring upon me nothing but agony?\n\nAs for my apathy, I struggle to kill myself due to the fact that my human instincts tell me to stay alive at all cost. It really is such a bother that instincts overpower our logical reasoning, you really have to sacrifice your humanity in order to off yourself; easier said than done.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovd3y3/kill_me/", "title": "Kill me?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Neo-unwell", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627758816, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovd3y3/kill_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428215.4991972, "replies_charged": false}
