I\u2019m constantly shrouded in a constant cloak of dread and anxiety for the future, I have no idea what I\u2019m doing.\n\n I want to end my life because I\u2019m bored and because I\u2019m lazy. It\u2019s just \u201cEhh; why not cut it off here, I don\u2019t really care.\u201d And I\u2019m scared of myself for those thoughts but it makes sense.\n\nMy nihilism and apathy towards practically every single aspect of life has dampened will to exist, I\u2019m just lazy. Sometimes I just want to sleep and not wake up.\n\nThis has been going hand in hand with my desperation for love and companionship. I desperate want to find someone who is worth keeping myself alive over, but as all my friend groups have been disconnected and broken all over, there\u2019s no one left.\n\nMy family has no bearing either. As much as I want to be connected to my family enough to gain the will to live, I just don\u2019t get that. I\u2019m disconnected from everyone.\n\nI just constantly want to die all the time out of sheer laziness and boredom, is that selfish? Just let the good times last then cut it off before I hit reality? The notion of going to sleep forever is extremely appealing to me.\n\nDespite all that, I know I won\u2019t kill myself anytime soon. I\u2019m a coward, I couldn\u2019t do it. But due to my mental state I do know that if something bad happens and sends me over the edge, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll probably do it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p5ag2i/im_selfish/", "title": "I\u2019m selfish", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AGayFurryWeaboo", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629094955, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p5ag2i/im_selfish/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427023.355687, "replies_charged": false}
