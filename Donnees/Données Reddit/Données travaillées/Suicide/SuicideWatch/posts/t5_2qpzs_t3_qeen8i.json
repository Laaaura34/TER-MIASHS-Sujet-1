If I don't distract myself I start having a panic attack.I should be happy, I have a good life, I started working on my self both mentally and physically but it seems that no matter how much I try nothing ever changes,I'm just so tired. I don't know if I can make it through the end of this year. I have a psychologist appointment next month so I will try to hold on until then. Some nights I just sit on my bed with a knife wondering if I should do it, I swear I'm just to close to my breaking point. This is not the first time that I have suicidal thoughts, but it is certainly the worst one. This week I managed to go 3 days without thinking too much about it, but now I'm back to ground zero.
