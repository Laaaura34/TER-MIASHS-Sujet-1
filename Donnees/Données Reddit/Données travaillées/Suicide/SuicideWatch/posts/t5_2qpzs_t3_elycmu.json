I'm 26 \n\nI think I've gone too long depressed, I don't have a positive foundation to fall on, positive memories that call me home and motivate me.. any motivation I've had comes from not wanting to betray my family, but I lost that as my mother became more financially stable..\n\nI've spent hours and years in therapy, I've tried holistic treatments.. it all has taught me how to survive in the midst of a suicidal crisis.\n\nThe problem is, that crisis never ends.. I never feel good about life. I always have screaming internally telling me to do whatever it takes to end my life..it's terrifying. Everything I have to do is doubly difficult because I always have to balance it with keeping my emotions in check, as to not have an outburst and impulsively make an attempt \n\nI don't want to traumatize anyone I'm close to, as I already feel terrible for getting so close to people knowing I don't intend to be here for too long.. hopefully I can take a trip and never come back, but if I can't make that happen fast enough then I'll have to get over my own caution \n\nI feel like the most honest and brave thing I can do is to die. I've spent my entire life in pain, suffering and hoping that death will provide relief I can't even find in my sleep.. \n\nI never thought I'd reach 25. I think that I've tried enough for my family and friends and don't feel as if I owe them my continued misery to prevent their own guilt.. I'm sure everyone won't be as heartbroken as I imagine.
