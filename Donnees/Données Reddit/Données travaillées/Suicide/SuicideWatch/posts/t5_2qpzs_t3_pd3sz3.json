I\u2019m in limbo of too scared to live too afraid to die. I can\u2019t take my own life. I believe I\u2019ll go to hell for that. I\u2019ve attempted once and couldn\u2019t bring myself to it. Everything has been a battle for me. Right now the biggest thing on my mind is Afghanistan. I can\u2019t go into detail but I wish I could do more than what I did. I want to go out there and do what I joined to do. I don\u2019t feel loved by my family anymore. I\u2019m home and nothing ever feels the same. I suffer from insomnia, depression, anxiety, and a cavalcade of physical issues. My parents are getting old and I am definitely homesick. I more or less feel like I\u2019m going through a quarter life crisis (23 y.o.). My mental health has been nothing but a downhill slide. I don\u2019t talk about my feelings because I\u2019m a guy a no one cares about it. My girlfriend tries to help but can\u2019t because she doesn\u2019t really understand all that I\u2019m going through. I\u2019m crying pretty much every day at one point or another for various reasons. I\u2019m not the guy I used to be. I feel like I\u2019m in a rut with my job and I\u2019m so fucking tired of covid stuff. Everything is being jammed down our throats all the time. I have a nicotine addiction, porn addiction (for serotonin). I blame myself for a lot of things in life. My gf says I\u2019m too hard on myself. I\u2019m in debt and I am fighting my way out of that. I have to put up a fa\u00e7ade so no one asks me if I\u2019m okay because I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not where I thought I\u2019d be in life. I\u2019m nowhere near it. I thought I\u2019d be more successful than I am. If you say I have success I\u2019d like to see where. I don\u2019t have much to show for my career. Albeit, there are people who are worse off than me, but there are ones who are better than me. That\u2019s what drives me crazy. There\u2019s always someone over me. I\u2019ll never be at the top, I\u2019ll never be good enough. I have a lot of issues and a lot of demons I fight. I have a lot of things that I can\u2019t find resolve to. I\u2019m homesick beyond belief and I feel like a failure. I\u2019m 23 with what to show? A failed marriage? A nicotine addiction? It doesn\u2019t make sense to me. None of it does. Was it the way I was raised? Was it my own doing? I dropped out of community college. The easiest fucking thing there is. Still nothing to show. Something killed the motivation in me. Will I get it back? Probably not. I am just cruising through life with a half- cocked plan and praying that it works. I have nothing to show that I\u2019m good and a lot to show that I\u2019m bad. Well, not bad in the sense of a bad person. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a good person. Yeah, I fuck up and have made some terrible mistakes. Yeah, I\u2019ve broken some hearts. But doesn\u2019t everyone? I want to feel emotion. To feel something. I\u2019m numb to a lot and when I\u2019m faced with adult choices and decisions I approach it like a child and just shut down. Waiting for someone else to pick up the slack. No one does and I learn tough lessons. Tough love. They say what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger, but what\u2019s strength in loss? What\u2019s loss without love? What\u2019s love without soul. I feel empty. Powerless. I opened myself up and I got hurt. Now I have to try and not hurt everyone. I\u2019m scared for any girl I date because I know I\u2019m going to end up hurting her because I always do. I didn\u2019t want to be like this. I want to be happy, in a good relationship, it\u2019s not that much to ask for.  Is it? Am I too expectant of life? I know God has a plan for me. I just want to know what it is. I find myself in this pit more often than not. I find myself searching for the answer- happiness- and cant find it. Is it right in front of me? I mean, I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a smart guy with a lot ahead of me but that\u2019s just wishful thinking. I\u2019m still driving the same roads, the same mess that I was before I hopped in my truck. I say it\u2019s therapy but it\u2019s a distraction. I\u2019m not man enough to face my troubles. I\u2019m not much of a man come to think of it. I\u2019m too emotional, I lack a lot of skills. I lack knowledge. I can\u2019t retain much anymore. My brain is fried and I feel like it\u2019s a sponge that\u2019s full. It\u2019s not taking any more information in. It\u2019s just forgetting it. I messed up a lot during my developmental years and I haven\u2019t recovered. I have a lot of shit that people don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have that many people that I can turn to. I don\u2019t feel like I have anyone and I\u2019m not enough. They tell me I am enough. But how do they know? I\u2019m disappointed in myself. My body image is awful. Most days I can\u2019t even look in a mirror. Let alone face myself. I can\u2019t be in silence for too long.
