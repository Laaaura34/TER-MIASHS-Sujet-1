Being bullied, abused my parents I have should have known my life had no worth and killed myself when I was younger.\n\nI've never been able to make real connections with people. I either scare them off by my clinginess and co dependency. Or they talk to me out of pity.\n\nThe one chance I had a real relationship I just couldn't accept things they way they were and tried to mold her to be what I wanted her to be.\n\nI became a monster. I can no longer blame my demons. I sabotaged the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm a true piece of shit.\n\nI've decided I'm leaving this world.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qh6dsc/im_the_villain_in_my_own_story/", "title": "I'm the villain in my own story", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "darkprince001", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635368165, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qh6dsc/im_the_villain_in_my_own_story/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423140.2246795, "replies_charged": false}
