I don't want people to remind me so I deleted all my media in my phone and all my contacts and chats. Everything (my computer died years ago. Haven't bought one since cuz I'm a failure and I've been 3 years unemployed) I would burn all my documents, IDs and old photos from my family albums if I could. I just want to dissappear. I wish I have never existed. I don't want nobody to mourn. I'm useless. I don't see a way out of this. I'm tired. I tried everything in 10 years. I don't want to keep trying.
