Just a few weeks ago, I had made a list of New Year's Resolutions and I was excited to change my ways baby step by baby step.\n\nNow that the day has come, I have no energy to even get out of bed. I've succumbed to the reality that I'm too immersed in my world of self-pity to change anything. \n\nI don't know what else to do when I can't even force myself to put in the effort to change my ways.\n\nI'm trapped in my own head, and I want to escape. I feel like I can't. My life is one big train-wreck and I am the only one to blame for that.\n\nI don't have the energy to kill myself, but it would be a sweet release from the fuckup I've become.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/abmeco/cant_escape_my_path_of_selfdestruction/", "title": "Can't escape my path of self-destruction", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Devlarousse", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1546379403, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/abmeco/cant_escape_my_path_of_selfdestruction/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422538.4861631, "replies_charged": false}
