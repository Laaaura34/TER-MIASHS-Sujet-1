Well, can I even call it that? It's kinda shitty.\n\nI painted it this year. It's a person staring at the viewer with the most cold contemptuous stare out there. It's made to represent this kind of feeling, not exclusively suicidality, but this *kind of feeling*, if you get what I mean.\n\nI fucking hate this dude. He's not a *real,* dude, he's a representation created by another person. But I absolutely hate this dude. I don't wanna give in! I want to give in, yes, but he's staring at me! I don't want him to win. \n\nHe's staring at me. Just staring. That's all he does, all the time. That's all he's ever done. He's staring like he wants me to die and I don't want to give him the satisfaction of being dead! \n\n\nSo, life pro-tip, make a painting that you really hate and that really wants you to die and don't die so you'll WIN, LIKE A REAL WINNAH", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mto9ya/painting_haphazardly_set_on_the_wall_wont_let_me/", "title": "Painting haphazardly set on the wall won't let me do it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Jinzy2005", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618788892, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mto9ya/painting_haphazardly_set_on_the_wall_wont_let_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427136.1255817, "replies_charged": false}
