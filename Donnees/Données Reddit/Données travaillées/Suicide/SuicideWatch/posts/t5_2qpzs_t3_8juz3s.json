Fuck the Jordanian society. I hate seeing my former friend (who I\u2019m still in love with) in pain, I\u2019ve been really mean to him lately to the point where he cried, I hate myself, I even cut myself today to punish myself for hurting him, I just broke down. \n\nLet me tell you the story of what happened today, (I\u2019m a girl in a guy\u2019s body btw) we were at gym class with the guys in my class, and they tried to get us to be friends again but we said no. And they tried to get us back to being friends again but we still didn\u2019t want to, then they tried to get us to fight physically but we didn\u2019t accept and they just kept physically pushing us to do it and we kept fighting against them, then i got out of the building and the coach fucking calls me and forces me to come back, and the stupid guys forced us fight verbally and we threw lots of insults at one another to the point where he cried, I didn\u2019t apologize out of hate for him after the heartbreak he gave me, but seeing him crying (we\u2019re both 14 btw) just burned my heart and I am crying right now because I hurt him and can\u2019t apologize (due to certain circumstances) , I don\u2019t know whether to blame myself or my classmates. I hate myself.\n\n        And another thing that happened at school today, the school counselor called me to her office today, and she has told me that my teachers told her that I am acting extremely femininely (I live in Jordan therefore my environment is very anti lgbt) and that she is worried about me, and that she kept questioning me about what\u2019s going on in my life and I know I can\u2019t tell her anything. she never got her answers and she\u2019s gonna question me more tomorrow. School in general does nothing more than raise my anxiety levels. (On an unrelated note: my therapist said I\u2019m vulnerable to developing anxiety disorder). I just recovered from anorexia and I wish it killed me, if you\u2019ve read my previous posts then u\u2019ll know I was already depressed and had anorexia. I just recovered from that anorexia and I wish it fucking killed me.
