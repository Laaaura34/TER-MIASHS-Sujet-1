I'm still working on my BSN and pre med courses, at 22. I feel like if I don't get to medical school, I'll be destitute and poor and everything else. I've had lots of professors praise me for my work and dedication but I don't feel like it's an achievement. I honestly don't feel like anything is an achievement anymore tbh. I don't know what to answer when I get asked \"what was your greatest achievement,\" or the like. I feel like I should go away from all the stress and anxiety about my future", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pnm36q/i_feel_like_a_failure/", "title": "I feel like a failure", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lucky-312", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631560029, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pnm36q/i_feel_like_a_failure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426950.3639472, "replies_charged": false}
