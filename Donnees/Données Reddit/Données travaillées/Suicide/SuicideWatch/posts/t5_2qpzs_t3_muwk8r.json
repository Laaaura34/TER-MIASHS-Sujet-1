It went away after I stopped struggling with my miserable life situation but at the same time I\u2019m just numb and resigned and that feeling is low-key still there and it will just reemerge under stress later when I don\u2019t have my family around. Conveniently also pushed away friends by ignoring them during the episode knew it was a bad idea but couldn\u2019t help myself because it \u201cfelt\u201d authentic. Also was a real asshole to one friend who didn\u2019t deserve it. I later apologized but I can\u2019t take it back. \n\nAt least at that point I was actively feeling something. It felt like life was real. Now I\u2019m just disassociated and can function like an automaton.
