My brain is broken to the point where I lose interest in everything after long enough doing it. I quit my career because programming became too unbearable, I barely hang out with others because I'm bored by people, I barely like video games anymore, and attempts to pick up new hobbies like art have just led to me eventually not wanting to do it anymore. Even getting through a day like this is an absolute challenge.\n\nI've tried everything too - medications, multiple therapists, getting tested for ADHD, TMS... The world just doesn't have a solution for me and it's becoming clear that this is my life now. An endless sea of gray that I don't want to live in. Anything I try is absolutely pointless and just leads to more suffering. So I'm seriously looking into suicide now, doing my research on methods, etc. It might be difficult and scary, but I think it's for the better. Others say they want me here but they clearly overestimate my importance and will see eventually I bring nothing but disappointment to the world. I still don't want to die right before the holidays because I want my family to enjoy those, January seems like a good time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e991bs/im_actually_going_to_die_of_boredom/", "title": "I'm actually going to die of boredom", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "trumpeterbuizel", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1576080646, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e991bs/im_actually_going_to_die_of_boredom/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427052.2018833, "replies_charged": false}
