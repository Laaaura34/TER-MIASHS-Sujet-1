Realise I'm just venting and hate myself for annoying them, get angry at myself and tell them to leave me alone when being alone is the last thing I want. Spend hours staring at my phone and crying until I'm so tired I can't stay up anymore, planning to end it all because it's not getting better and then I wake up the next day. Repeat ad-infinitum. It's like some sick joke. I just want it to stop.
