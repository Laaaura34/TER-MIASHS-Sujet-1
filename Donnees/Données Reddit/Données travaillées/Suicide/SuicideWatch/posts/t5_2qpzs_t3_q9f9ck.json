Nighttime sobbing, pacing and insomnia. Was eating some fast food to try and put something in my stomach but just interested in water now. All I\u2019ve ever wanted is a safe person who wouldn\u2019t abuse me and I found her but she\u2019s gone and I\u2019m alone 2,000 miles from home for grad school with homophobic parents who only think she was my \u201cfriend,\u201d who cares if I finish anymore. We were supposed to graduate the same day, but I already have two of these degree things so a third isn\u2019t necessary.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9f9ck/i_want_to_join_her_after_the_funeral/", "title": "I want to join her after the funeral", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ClassifiedRain", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634401450, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9f9ck/i_want_to_join_her_after_the_funeral/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426521.301656, "replies_charged": false}
