I wonder if anyone is my age or has had similar feelings?\n\nI have a history of dealing with depression but have been well for several years now. I self harmed in the past, but again have been coping more appropriately for some years now. \n\nSomething has changed however and I'm having trouble putting my finger on it. I have symptoms of depression I never had in the past. Recently I have been experiencing very large mood swings that shock me. I go from OK to distraught so very easily. For some reason I don't seem to be able to suffer the slightest setback without immediately sinking into some very scary self talk. \n\nI have an \"iron tower\" in my mind. It is my strength. It isn't literal - I don't imagine it, but it resembles my resilience to resorting to my old suicidal behavior and self harm. My resistance is crumbling - slowly but surely. \n\nOne symptom I had never experienced up until now was losing the pleasure in my life. Nothing is fun. This sounds almost stupid to try and describe. I just don't want to do anything and I am terribly bored. Suicidally bored. But there is more to it of course.\n\nI hesitate to go into detail about what I think about because I don't want to trigger anyone else and I dont know if its against the rules to go into detail or not (even though I have read the faq/guidelines). Suffice it to say that I know how I want to harm myself for \"relief\" and also how I would kill myself. I've worked all that out.\n\nOne thing preventing me from hurting myself is not wanting anyone to know. I consider hurting myself in places that no-one can see, but eventually you give yourself away by limping or... worse. There's also the fact the iron tower isnt broken quite yet and this is more so a fantasy at the moment.\n\nThe whole mood swing thing is really worrying me a lot. I am a quiet, gentle, soft spoken man. I am the safest man in the world (figure of speech), but there is a range inside me that scares me. I can't direct this rage at others - that is not who I am but I can direct it at myself - ie through the self harm. I fear that if the rage boils over that the self harm would be reactionary or on the spur of the moment rather than calm and calculated. I fear the harm I could do to myself in that state.\n\nThe rage is complicated. Partly it is a simple expression of despair, partly is an expression of helplessness. I guess these must be anger in there too. I don't want to go there because that is a part of me that I don't process.\n\nMy relationships are beginning to break down. I keep pushing friends away. Usually they know that after I am alone for long enough that I will come back to them. Generally they accept this. \n\nI don't tell anyone my feelings. Many years ago, when I was young my mother visited me in the hospital after a suicide attempt. She was all about WHY. I had no answer. My father never ever demanded an explanation - he just loved me. But dad is dead now. He died about a year ago. I could hug him and he wouldn't ask what was wrong even though I'm sure he would listen. This was good because there was always nothing to tell. But those days are gone.\n\nMy ex killed herself some years ago now. I never processed those feelings properly. If I am honest I feel responsible. By this I mean I failed to stop her. She promised me the day I met her that inside 1 year she would be dead. She kept her promise. I was so stupid - so unbelievably stupid! As time went by, she treated gradually worse and worse until at the end she was making me miserable enough to consider... ending it. I had to leave her to save myself. 2 weeks later she killed herself and I was not there to stop her. Her plan worked perfectly. She got rid of me on purpose so that she could jump in front of a train and I was not there to stop her. This is not a fresh wound I must admit. But it has not healed either.\n\nI feel helpless because I am terrified of reaching out. I lost my best friend, again many years ago now, because I told him how I was feeling and he couldn't deal with it. I have not reached out since. \n\nI am going crazy inside. I have no outlet. I feel like I need to cry out in pain but I cant even open my mouth. I don't honestly know how much longer I can go on. I am terrified the iron tower is crumbling and I am going to do something. I admit, at first it will be self harming but I have some very specific plans in my mind now about how I am going to kill myself.\n\nThank you for allowing me to vent some of my feelings. Thank you for reading my words. That was very kind of you to take the time.
