I'm just wondering how all those \"good hearted\" people adore me if I'm dead. Believe it or not, one actually cares if until I'm dead. Those who don't give an absolute fuck when I'm not doing well will bring their ass with a poem. \"We miss that one. Wish they were here. Wish they talked. My heart goes to them\". Isn't that funny? I always wonder.\nIt's god awfully frustrating and ridiculous.
