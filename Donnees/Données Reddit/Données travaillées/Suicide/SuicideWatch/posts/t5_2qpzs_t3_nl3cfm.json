Zoloft gave me very bad physical side effects after about 6 months of use age. However, now I feel emotionally drained. I have suicidal thoughts, I am extremely anxious & become agitated at the smallest things. \n\nIs this normal? My doctor said to give a week to see if my mood improves. Has anyone had any experience similar? Does mood usually increase after the withdrawal period?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nl3cfm/zoloft_withdrawal/", "title": "Zoloft Withdrawal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hcz1234", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621986548, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nl3cfm/zoloft_withdrawal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428011.2195435, "replies_charged": false}
