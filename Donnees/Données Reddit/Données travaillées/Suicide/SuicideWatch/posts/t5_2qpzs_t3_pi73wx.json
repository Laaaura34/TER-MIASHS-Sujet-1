She screamed at me and i\u2019ve felt so awful about it because she has a point, like i\u2019m basically nothing without academic validation. This is also because my uncle (my moms sisters husband) has basically hated me since he met me, because i\u2019ve always done better in school than my cousins (his kids). he says the only reason why i do so well is because of the school i go to (they live in a nicer neighborhood), and he\u2019s always guilt tripped my mom because i went on vacation to disney world with them once when i was like 6, which i don\u2019t even know why he\u2019s so upset about it but he\u2019s always gone out of his way to make me feel like i\u2019m not apart of his family. (i\u2019m also african and my parents and aunts and uncles are all immigrants, which doesn\u2019t help with academic pressure)\n\nthe only person that\u2019s really ever liked me was my dad, but he died when i was 5. my mom said that she didn\u2019t care about having me but my dad was so excited to have me. I have no one now though. I know my mom loves me , but i don\u2019t think she likes me, does that make sense?\n\ni guess i just want to be cared for which sounds really stupid and i know i am completely privileged to be talking about wanted to be cared for when i have a good education, a roof over my head, food on the table, a loving family, and endless opportunities. that\u2019s just why im so conflicted.\n\nagain, it\u2019s extremely embarrassing to be this down about stereotypical teenage girl problems to the point that i\u2019m suicidal, so i\u2019m really sorry if you have real problems in your life and you\u2019re reading this and thinking i\u2019m a complete idiot. i guess i just want peace.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pi73wx/im_15_and_im_probably_going_to_be_dead_by_the_end/", "title": "i\u2019m 15 and i\u2019m probably going to be dead by the end of this week", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "glossiermint", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630819380, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pi73wx/im_15_and_im_probably_going_to_be_dead_by_the_end/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425452.4950492, "replies_charged": false}
