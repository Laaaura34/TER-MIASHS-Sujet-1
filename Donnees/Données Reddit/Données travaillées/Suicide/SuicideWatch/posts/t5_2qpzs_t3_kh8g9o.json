How are we supposed to go back and live a normal life around normal peoples?\n\nHi, a little bit of context here.\n\nI've been on and off of this sub for almost a year now, reading others peoples's story helped me coping with my own issues. I've always felt depressed since my 13/14 yo but still doing well at school, living in a abusive house until my 21 to get a work that was supposed to be my start in life, but ended up being the source of my burnout and the start of the worst suicidal episode of my life.\n\nThis time started in June 2019. After some months on antidepressants, some in therapy, many suicidal crisis, a lot of video games, and plenty of time allowed to myself to heal and deal with all my traumas, I can say that as today I feel more free of depression that I ever been.\n\nBut even with all this work, I'm still exhausted. I feel like at 23 I already seen, felt, heard too much violence and pain. Even with the many times I shared my story, I still feel the weight of having a bad childhood, even worse teen years being queer, and all the professional burnout stuff.\n\nI have no idea what I'm supposed to do next, where to go, and how to exist around humans, something that always been very hard for me and even more now, who haven't been through the same hell I survived. I'm ashamed to think it was 'easier' when I was at my worst cause It was making sense and had a clear objective back then (like, try to not die) when so many of us are still fighting everyday.\n\nAny wise words are welcome!
