Guilt doesn't equal someone caring and loving you. \n\nWhen someone cares about you. You being sad makes them sad because they see the pain your in. \n\nNot because it's socially acceptable to be fake or \"I don't want to live with being guilty\"  \n\nI don't want someones pity or guilt... I would want someone to genuinely want me in there life .. actually give a damn about me..\n\nNot keep me around, not be a second choice or last resort... Not be someone living just to say \"hey I stopped this person from dying so no guilt on me\" fuck you and leave me alone", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lm0yuc/there_is_a_difference_between_guilt_and_genuine/", "title": "There is a difference between guilt and genuine love and care.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "snappysierra", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 38, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613586051, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lm0yuc/there_is_a_difference_between_guilt_and_genuine/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426198.561242, "replies_charged": false}
