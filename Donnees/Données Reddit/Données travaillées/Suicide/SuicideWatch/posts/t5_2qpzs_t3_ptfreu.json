I have wanted to die for so many years and keep trying to convince myself that it will get better but as time goes on it only gets worse. I have given up all hope of ever being happy again. Right now my anorexia is the worst it has ever been because I don\u2019t want to live anymore so I\u2019m hoping that\u2019ll slowly kill me. I tried hanging myself but there aren\u2019t any poles sturdy enough in my house. I have a gun that I have access to and I think of shooting myself in the head every single day. I have nothing. I don\u2019t look forward to anything in life and I wake up every single day wishing I hadn\u2019t. I know the pain won\u2019t ever stop and I\u2019m tired of fighting. The only person I cared about in the world left me for good and it made everything a million times worse. I can\u2019t do it anymore. No meds, doctors, hospitals, etc have been able to help me and it only gets harder and harder to live. I\u2019m done.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ptfreu/hopeless/", "title": "Hopeless", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "emilyvercoe", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632341391, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ptfreu/hopeless/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422256.766832, "replies_charged": false}
