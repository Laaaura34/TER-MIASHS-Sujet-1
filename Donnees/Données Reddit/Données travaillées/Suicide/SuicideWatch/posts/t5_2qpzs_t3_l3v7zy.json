And I wasted my early adulthood. I'm still young, but I carry so much shame and regret from my actions. I want to forgive myself, but I can't. I\u2019m boring, untalented, tired, unproductive, immature, and weird. I keep losing friends. My family doesn't understand that if they loved me as a teenage, I would not be here. The emotional abuse has ruined my life. I've been trying so hard, but I keep making mistakes. I want to be independent. I want to have a hobby. I can't do it. I\u2019m so tired of sitting in my couch every single day. I\u2019m tired of being trapped. I wish I could get lost in my work and focus. I\u2019m so happy when I focus but I\u2019m always ruminating. I already ruined my reputation. I\u2019m awkward and don\u2019t know boundaries. I lost too many people I love over stupid things. I swear, it I could take a pill to never wake up, I would do it. I'm tired of saying it will get better because it never does. Something always impedes me. I don\u2019t know how much more I can take. The only thing that stops is the possibility of severe disability due to an attempt and the possible pain that accompanies many methods. I don\u2019t wanna die. I just don\u2019t this want life. I truly think I\u2019m going to die by my own hands.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l3v7zy/if_i_wasnt_scared_of_the_pain_i_would_do_it/", "title": "If I wasn't scared of the pain, I would do it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "grumpy-buns", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611474690, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l3v7zy/if_i_wasnt_scared_of_the_pain_i_would_do_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428054.6224692, "replies_charged": false}
