I tried to call them because I\u2019m very overwhelmed due to COVID-19 and the ongoing civil unrest in the country. I\u2019m 19, and I have never been this anxious before. I am not actively wanting to kill myself but I am having a hard time seeing the \u201clight at the end of the tunnel.\u201d You\u2019d think the 1-800-273-8255 number would be a better resource, but all they did was shoo me away and tell me my problems weren\u2019t critical enough. I feel like I have nobody to talk to. I\u2019m so scared and helpless right now. I have no job. I am worried for my safety in the US. I don\u2019t feel safe anywhere I go and I\u2019m wondering if it might just be better if I take some pills and end it all.
