Managed to get through high school and started college but I had a meltdown halfway through it. Took a break and then I went back, couldn't finish it either. Decided to go straight to work and my first job was ok. Second one was going fine until they started expecting me to do the work of 3 people for the salary of one. Noped outta there quick. Got a job recently and things aren't going great. I've fucked up about 4 times already and I fully expect to be fired in the upcoming days. I've failed the driving test twice, and seeing all my friends have their careers pretty much set is heartbreaking. \n\nI know I'm not going to die of old age. I'm going to take my life at some point but I can't be sure when that will be. I think that after I lose my current job, if for whatever reason my girlfriend breaks up with me, that'll be it. I'm not happy at the moment. I'm supposed to go to work tomorrow but I'd rather drive off a cliff or something. I don't want to be here right now. I wish I had the courage to take my life but I'm too much of a coward to do so. Felt like my life was getting back on track and in a span of 2 weeks I've had 4 fuck-ups that could get me fired. I feel like I'm not meant to have a happy ending, and I don't see myself dying of old age. I just wish I had the guts to end it all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pd1bah/i_sometimes_feel_like_my_life_story_is_meant_to/", "title": "I sometimes feel like my life story is meant to be one of failure", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway15641561", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630116990, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pd1bah/i_sometimes_feel_like_my_life_story_is_meant_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426957.0033653, "replies_charged": false}
