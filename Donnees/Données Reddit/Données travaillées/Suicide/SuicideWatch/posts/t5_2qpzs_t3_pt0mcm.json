There have been so many times that I was convinced I was going to try to kill myself and I didn\u2019t and I regret not doing it every time. I struggle a lot with anxiety and my automatic solution to any of my problems is just to kill myself. I\u2019ve been contemplating suicide for so long that ending the debate by killing myself is a reason to kill myself. I feel so guilty though because I have a good life and a lot of opportunities and potential ahead of me but I\u2019m just not interested and it all just gives me a lot of anxiety. I wish I could just stop existing all together so that I wouldn\u2019t have to hurt anyone because of my death, or at least die by something other than suicide. I\u2019ve only attempted suicide once which was 6 months ago and I\u2019m just frustrated and disappointed that I didn\u2019t die. I know I\u2019m going to end up attempting again if I don\u2019t die from something else.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pt0mcm/ive_been_having_suicidal_thoughts_every_single/", "title": "I\u2019ve been having suicidal thoughts every single day for 6 years", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "melon_cholicc", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632287809, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pt0mcm/ive_been_having_suicidal_thoughts_every_single/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425194.949313, "replies_charged": false}
