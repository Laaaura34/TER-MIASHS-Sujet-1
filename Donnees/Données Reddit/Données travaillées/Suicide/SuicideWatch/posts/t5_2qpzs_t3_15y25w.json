Australia.\n\nI am a bit of a narcisstic, condescending type of person.\n\nI am trying to become the best I can be, improving my life and the like.\n\nWhat I do think is: Why should I continue to live, what's the point? People are ruining this place, I am lonely; I have not seen my closest friends for over a month. I can drive, but I don't have a license, I am not working on anything, no projects, no motivation. My intelligence is wasting; this world is just a bore, I feel like my life is slowly being sucked by people who are continuously unhappy and miserable.\n\nMy mother is a loving and caring mother, but hypocritical with double standards and sometimes stupid as fuck.\n\nThe only person I loved (my ex, only girlfriend) I managed to hurt and I attempted to get back together.\n\nI know many people are kind, but ... fuck it. Why? It is so simple, so easy. The world is dominated by people who have hate and corruption inside of them, and it's not fixable.\n\nSome people cannot see what I can; I once thought I cared about no one, but I just don't care about people that are not in contact with me. The people I create temporary care 'units' for are people I interact with physically in my job, people I talk with on skype (every day), people I know and have met previously (friends).\n\nI am learning a new language, am not in uni/college (dropped out of uni at second sem, couldnt handle it. Failed two units in the first semester, couldnt understand shit in the second.).\n\nWhat I am doing to improve myself is:\n\n* I am doing nofap/noporn. This is purely to get my grades, motivation and a girl.\n\n* Thinking and talking less about religion: Barely anyone understand what I mean when I say that people have the wrong concept of God and good/bad.\n\n* Giving a whole lot to society, i.e. talking with people, helping them, teaching them, small talk.\n\nI just don't know what to do, it's driving me crazy. I feel crazy in this ... current place/time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/15y25w/brain_is_overloaded_society_is_selfdestructive/", "title": "Brain is overloaded.
