You just wish it was all an easy fix like it was for you don't you danguro? Or maybe you want something that goes into what you can call normal \"\n\nThe words that finally broke the camel's back.\n\nTo backtrack.. my closest friend.. has been suicidal since before i met him. Whether it was his father's beatings, his mother's emotional abuse or their constant bickering with themselves and towards him, im not exactly sure. He says hes been suicidal since as far back as he can remember and the thought of dying is the only thing that can bring him true happiness.. not when we dated. Not the person he is with right now. Not even having a billion dollars.\n\nHe just wants out. Of his defective body. Of this defective world. Hes tried anything possible to try to be happy but he's never truly stayed so...\n\nToday he began talking with some of his friends and they then decided to form a suicide pact. To go out with a bang one day all together when all the resources are pooled together..\n\nAnd what the hell can i even do about it? If i call the police i lose him. He cant even go to a doctor because he has no insurance and he has no trust for psychologists\n\nAnd what am i to fucking do...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4w9ts9/i_need_help/", "title": "I need help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "danguro", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1470394361, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4w9ts9/i_need_help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427737.5661023, "replies_charged": false}
