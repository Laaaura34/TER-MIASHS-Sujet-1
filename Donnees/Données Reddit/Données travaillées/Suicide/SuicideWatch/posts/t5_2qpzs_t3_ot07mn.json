I had a pounding headache, had to hold my breath so my parents wouldn\u2019t hear me crying.I\u2019ve been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years. The lain from never being able to be with her has contributed to my decision to kill myself; ive already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. \n\nIt reads.\n\nDear K,\n\nI wish you knew how special you are to me. I wish you knew you how happy I would be if we were together. But I know that wouldn\u2019t make you happy. So, I have to let you be happy. That is what I want, because I love you so much. \n\nI wish you knew how happy you make me. I wish you knew how full of love my heart is for you. I wish I could hold you in my arms and protect you so that no one could hurt you. \n\nWhen I was young, I learned the word for \u201calways\u201d in French: *toujours.* It always sounded like a beautiful, graceful, yet heavy word to me. Something about how it sounds. It sounds melancholy, sentimental, but genuine and strong. \n\nYou\u2019ll always be in my heart. Toujours. Always. You\u2019ll always be in my heart. I promise. \n\nI love you so much.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ot07mn/ive_written_a_few_different_suicide_notes_to_im/", "title": "I\u2019ve written a few different suicide notes to I\u2019m going to send people when I do it.
