My eyes got so weirdly... grey? But it\u2019s a sturdy belt. Might find a way to sit while doing it for tonight so I\u2019m not stuck trying to do it standing up (but the one good hook in my closet is in a weird spot). \n\nI hate how indecisive I am but really I\u2019m not scared or sad anymore it just feels like it\u2019s supposed to be the end. And who am I to argue with that? \n\nOnce I finish this cup of tea and a slice of sponge cake I can put on a chill beats playlist and get it done.
