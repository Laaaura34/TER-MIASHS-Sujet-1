Can\u2019t hold a single job for no longer than 3 days, $0 to my name, dropped out of jc, now poly. The reason why I left poly? It\u2019s cause I couldn\u2019t take the stress from internship. Never dated, super insecure (bullied for my appearace in sec school) I\u2019m 20, and my life is a mess. I no longer love doing what I spent 7 years of my life doing and I just want to disappear. I attempted two to three weeks back; hanging. But guess what? I failed :) Currently on anti-depressants and taking a shit load of sleeping pills because I don\u2019t want to stay awake (the anti-depressants cause insomnia) I barely have enough energy to get out of bed (duh), I hate talking to people, and I am thinking of cutting off all connections. I\u2019m only holding on temporarily because I know how much it\u2019s going to hurt my family members and friends (maybe????). To be very honest, I want just want someone to tell me that\u2019s it\u2019s ok to leave. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s the point of typing this", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/prc373/failure/", "title": "Failure", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ok_Zookeepergame7441", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 72, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632071643, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/prc373/failure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426514.2274363, "replies_charged": false}
