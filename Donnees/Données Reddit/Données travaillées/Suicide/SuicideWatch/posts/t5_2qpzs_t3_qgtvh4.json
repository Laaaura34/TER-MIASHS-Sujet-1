Three years ago I was sexually and emotionally abused. I reported it but u it I was handled horribly by the police and it never went any further. I never got help because I was made to feel (by the police) like it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I then shared a class with said person for the next few years. \n\nIn that time I was suicidal, self harming and severely depressed and anxious. I got a bit better but it never really went away. Then in 2020 I went to college. It\u2019s a dance college so I already work my body to the limits. But my teacher is awful and borders on emotionally abusive. I hate the place and every day I am scared to go in. I love dance and in a few months I have auditions for dance universities. I need my tutor to get to an audition ready place. \n\nThen this year I am done. The pandemic ruined me. I\u2019m still severely depressed and anxious. Since I was 13 years old I have seen so many people who tired to help me mentally but lost if the time they saw me for one session and that was it. Then in December 2019 I finally found someone who I clicked with and they were helping. Then in February they disappeared off the face of the earth and they referred me to another mental health service. \n\nThen a month ago I had an assessment for this service where I disclosed my past trauma. A week later I had a social worker at my door who I had to recount this to who then told me the police would have to get involved again, against my will. I then had to recount my story to a police officer who then gave me TWO DAYS to decide if I wanted to prosecute. I\u2019m 17, I felt like that was way too little time. After that I was a wreck, I felt physically sick and anxious and I wasn\u2019t in college. I found it it\u2019s a 6/9 month waiting list until I can get help from the mental health service and it\u2019s going to be a while until I can get help from specially trained SA counsellors. \n\nThen to top it all off we\u2019re getting our kitchen redone and it\u2019s all gone tits up. We\u2019ve had no kitchen for three months so we can\u2019t really cook anything and we have no tap except out bathroom one. My gran got diagnosed with cancer and both of my sisters have had covid and had both been around my gran. And now my younger sister has got it to keep everyone safe my family isn\u2019t even living together. \n\nIt\u2019s all small things but I\u2019ve had enough. I have two jobs and I\u2019m so stressed with college and everything else happening in my life. I have virtually no help from anyone to help me deal with anything (my family and boyfriend are great support systems but there\u2019s only so much they can do). I\u2019ve tried using crisis lines but they don\u2019t really help. \n\nI am done. It genuinely feels like there is no way out of this right now and I can\u2019t cope anymore. And while I don\u2019t want to do anything or think that I will I don\u2019t know how to cope anymore. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is a rant or me asking for advice but any words right now would be nice.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgtvh4/i_cant_do_this_anymore/", "title": "I can\u2019t do this anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Emmy_C484", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635331691, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgtvh4/i_cant_do_this_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426155.6617725, "replies_charged": false}
