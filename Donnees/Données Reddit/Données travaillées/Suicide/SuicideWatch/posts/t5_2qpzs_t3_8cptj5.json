I've been running on empty and the only thing holding me here now is the suicide pact with B. We take turns trying to support and help one another but I don't see myself coming back on the up swing this time.  Qs helped so much, disposing of the co generator chemicals when i confided in her. I wish that it won't hurt her but I know it will devestate her. I wasn't meant for this life and it'll hurt but it'll be easier for my family once I'm gone. It'll be easier for me to finally rest. Maybe I've at least earned that with how hard I've tried.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8cptj5/close_now/", "title": "Close now", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CatOnEdge", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1523903512, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8cptj5/close_now/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427719.5294952, "replies_charged": false}
