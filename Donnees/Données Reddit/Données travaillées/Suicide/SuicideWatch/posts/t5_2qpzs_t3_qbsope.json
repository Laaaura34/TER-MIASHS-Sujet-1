Im so depressed all the time. Its hard for my to sleep and even when i do sleep i wake up tired. I have physical medical conditions so sometimes i have to go work 9hr shifts while my knees and back feel like they're going to give out. My work place sucks. I can't get any disability accommodations and my coworkers are miserable old fucks who can't mind their business. I cant quit because i wouldn't be able to pay my bills.\n\nWorking 32hrs plus school is too much for me. Im constantly in pain, sleepy, and depressed..\n\nI would kill myself but i don't want to leave my dog.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbsope/too_depressed_to_work_or_do_my_school_work_i/", "title": "Too depressed to work or do my school work.
