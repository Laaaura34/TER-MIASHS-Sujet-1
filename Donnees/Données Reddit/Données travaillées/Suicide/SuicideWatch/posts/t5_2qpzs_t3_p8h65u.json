Does anyone else feel like this it's not just the sadness and pain that's there it's the constant state of emptiness and feeling meaningless , I sit here all day doing nothing because I don't have the energy to but the boredom is just making me go crazy pushing me over that line what is the point in being here if I don't even have meaningless tasks to carry out all day , am I really that useless and sad? It's making me go insane and I can only distract myself so much and it's not like I have the energy to leave the house, unless I'm forced to distracting myself will just shut it up for a short amount of time but everything I'm feeling the pain the numbness the boredom it's still there you can't mask it. I've waited so long for all of this to go away and it hasn't so I should end it instead at least I won't be bored or in pain any longer.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p8h65u/i_feel_like_its_not_just_hating_life_that_makes/", "title": "I feel like it's not just hating life that makes you want to kys but it's the boredom", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "foxykkj", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629504731, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p8h65u/i_feel_like_its_not_just_hating_life_that_makes/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426997.2399607, "replies_charged": false}
