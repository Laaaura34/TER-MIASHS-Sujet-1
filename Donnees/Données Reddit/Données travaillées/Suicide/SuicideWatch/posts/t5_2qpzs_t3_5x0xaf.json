{"id": "t5_2qpzs_t3_5x0xaf", "request": ["6a3a22ea-a63d-4c77-abec-8837c7ab4dc0"], "text": "I\u2019ve been sitting here, typing and retyping.  I\u2019m having a hard time trying to articulate myself.  I\u2019ve been debating posting here.  I don\u2019t know if I belong here.  I\u2019m sorry this is so long.  But I need some help.  \n\nI just want to hear some stories about people who had depression and suicidal thoughts, and overcame them.  Or is living despite them.  Please just tell me that there is a light at the end of all this effort.  I just need some positivity.  I need a lifejacket, I need a rope to guide me to safety, or a stick to fight the monsters, or a warm blanket to make me feel safe.  I can\u2019t keep going like this.  Oh god please tell me that it can get better.  I need some positive words.  \n\nI have a support system but my family doesn\u2019t understand depression.  I can\u2019t talk about suicide with them.  I\u2019m not saying their lives were easy.  But neither of them have hated themselves like I hate me.  I need to hear from people who have hated themselves that, somehow, they don\u2019t anymore.  I want to hear about how that happened- if it\u2019s a process that took seventy years or two months, I don\u2019t care; I need some hope.  Because sometimes life feels like a series of rock-bottoms.  And each pit gets worse and worse.  \n\nSuicide pops into my head at least once a day, if not more.  Normally it was like a security blanket, like \u201cwell if I fail this test I\u2019ll just kill myself.\u201d  It made me feel better.  Or wishing for a truck to destroy my car in some sort of accident.  But I\u2019m so unmotivated lately and miserable and empty.  I have a plan and a means to carry it out.  I\u2019m just too cowardly to do it.  I still want to believe life is worth living.  So many people seem to enjoy it, at least.  And my family would be so upset if I was gone.  If it wasn\u2019t for my family, I would be dead already.\n\nI guess, for context, I\u2019m twenty-four years old and female.  I\u2019m getting a Masters in literature, and I\u2019m interested in queer theory and comic studies.  My first semester I had to drop a class because of unmedicated depression and ADHD, and I lost my GA position.  I worked hard, continuing to work for my GA professors unpaid, and have regained the position this spring and am back to fulltime.  But I\u2019m slipping again.  I haven\u2019t done two homework assignments for a class, and I can\u2019t even explain why.  I\u2019m sitting in front of the reading material for ten hours and I don\u2019t get past three sentences.  I cut off distractions (internet, phone), but my stupid head can\u2019t focus.  It\u2019s hard to get out of bed.  I can sleep for over twelve hours and still feel exhausted.  Or I get insomnia and can\u2019t sleep for three days.  I eat too much.  I eat until I throw up, then I eat more.  It\u2019s weird; I want to feel happiness with food, but it\u2019s also a way of punishing myself.\n\nI\u2019ve been depressed since middleschool or maybe earlier.  I just remember discovering in 6th grade that it\u2019s not normal to think about suicide every day.  Things used to be bearable but it\u2019s harder and harder to move forward now.  I\u2019ve been on and off medication since middle school.  Right now I\u2019m on Zoloft 150mg.  My doctor doesn\u2019t want to prescribe me ADHD meds until my mood has stabilized.  For the first time in my life I\u2019ve been taking my meds at a regular time period, every night at 10pm.  I have a therapist, but I won\u2019t see her for another two weeks.\n\nI like graphic novels and Overwatch.  I\u2019ve always wanted to make my own webcomic, but I\u2019m not very good at writing or at art.  All my ideas are childish and silly.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much of that was necessary, but that\u2019s about me.  I don\u2019t normally talk about myself and am a little embarrassed to talk so much.  So please tell me about yourself.  I want to know it gets better.  I need encouragement from people who\u2019ve been through it.  Please help me.  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5x0xaf/i_dont_have_a_good_title_please_help_me/", "title": "I don't have a good title.
