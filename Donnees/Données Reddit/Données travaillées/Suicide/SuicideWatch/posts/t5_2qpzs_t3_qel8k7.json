It\u2019s numb. Put a dent in my dorm wall, which I can\u2019t pay for. Threw a bag of cups across my room, and forgot I\u2019d stuffed my $100+ sunglasses in there one night after drinking. Broken. I just spent money on a new PC, which I can\u2019t use anymore. I\u2019m falling behind in my classes, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m going to get fired from my part time job Monday, and I still have to go into my shift which is tomorrow.\n\nThings have been bad this past week since I\u2019ve been quitting cold turkey from Weed. Yes you can have withdrawals, yes you can be addicted. I don\u2019t have the strength to get up tomorrow, but I have to. I know that\u2019s the only thing I can do to continue, but I just can\u2019t. I can\u2019t even sob anymore, my throat is sore and my face is covered in snot and drying tears. I\u2019m at my lowest point since I made an attempt on my life 1 1/2 years prior. If I weren\u2019t so afraid of what\u2019s waiting for me after this life, and the pain of putting a knife to my wrists, this would be the last fucking thing anyone ever heard from me. And yet I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t do anything. Quite possibly I will never amount to anything of worth in this world, since I\u2019m such a fucking raging, pathetic cry baby. The only girl I\u2019ve ever had enough courage to ask out rejected me, twice. We\u2019re still very good friends, and yet we both know I like her, maybe even love her. This didn\u2019t happen recently I just figured why not paint the whole fucking picture while I\u2019m at it.\n\nI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m posting this. I wouldn\u2019t tell a soul of this to anyone, not because I\u2019m proud, I just don\u2019t want anyone to see how sad and pathetic I really am.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qel8k7/i_cant/", "title": "I can\u2019t", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DoctorButterMonkey", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635051164, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qel8k7/i_cant/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425185.2597265, "replies_charged": false}
