Now fast forward to 4 weeks ago, she breaks up with me and says that I am the cause of all her unhappiness. I then get a message from some of my friends calling me a fuck up and saying they want absolutely nothing to do with me as well as me finally going clean. And then just 3 days ago I found out my pop has cancer. On top of all this my crohns is back and worse than ever and my doctor says if I have another surgery I won\u2019t survive for too many years. I just want the pain to stop, the mental and physical pain. I did the method of sleeping on these thoughts and seeing how you feel in the morning but I really can\u2019t go on.
