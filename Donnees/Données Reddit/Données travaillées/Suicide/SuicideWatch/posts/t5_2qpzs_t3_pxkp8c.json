My dad sat next to me because I'm a minor or something like that. She asked how often I was suicidal. I replied that it was basically every day now. Then she asks about if I self harm, which I do (and had done a few weeks prior). Then she asked if I had the suicide crisis line on my phone (I don't because I will probably be treated like shit by police/mental health facility. Btw, I'm not scared of going to a hospital as I live in a pretty well off area, but once again, my dad :/ THENNNN she asks if he keeps my meds locked up. He just stares at her. \"Meds locked up? uh- no\" I think he doesn't really believe I'm suicidal, because I haven't attempted, or at least haven't attempted to the point of hospital needs. The worst I've gotten was taking 40mg lexapro  (yes I know, pathetic). Anyways, yeah- that was fun. At least she refilled the meds I've wanted to get refilled for a month.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pxkp8c/my_psych_appointment_showed_how_little_my_dad/", "title": "My psych appointment showed how little my dad believes I can/will do it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sad-birb-lover-", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632878514, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pxkp8c/my_psych_appointment_showed_how_little_my_dad/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426130.3819866, "replies_charged": false}
