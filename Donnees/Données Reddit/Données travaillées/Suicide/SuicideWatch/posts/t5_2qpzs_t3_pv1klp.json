My house isn't big, so jumping would injure me, not kill me. We don't have any ropes here. Sleeping pills aren't accessible to me. So the only option that I have right now is to stab myself with a knife and I'm fine with that. All I want to do is to be able to stab myself without the risk of being found by someone and surviving with possibly permanent injuries. I want to die quickly even if that means that I'll be going through a lot of pain. So my question is: What areas of the human body are more vulnerable to cuts and stabs than others?\n\nAnd don't tell me that I shouldn't do it. I've already made up my mind. I've got friends and family, but only a few of them care about me. Most of them have even abused, neglected, betrayed, and abandoned me. The ones who do care about me aren't here with me right now and weren't there for me when I needed them the most. But they still care since they still talk to me and stuff. My point is that I have no one and nothing to live for. I'm completely alone. There isn't a single person that I can count on, but of course everyone else can count on me since I'm willing to help anyone. It just sucks that no one's willing to help me. So yeah, I've been through a lot in my life and I don't have anyone that I can trust and count on. I literally have no reason to continue living. I'm in so much pain and there isn't anything that I or anyone else can do about it. I've already made up my mind, so don't try to convince me to change my decision.\n\nAll I need is help in killing myself. I'm not a doctor. I'm not that familiar with the human body. I've already tried looking for information on this on Google and I couldn't find anything. So I would really appreciate it if someone could answer my question: What areas of the human body are more vulnerable to cuts and stabs than others?. I'd also prefer if it was lengthy and detailed so I'd know where to stab specifically and other things that I can't think of right now. I look forward to your answers.
