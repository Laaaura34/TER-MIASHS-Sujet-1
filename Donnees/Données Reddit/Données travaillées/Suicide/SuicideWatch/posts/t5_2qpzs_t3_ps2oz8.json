And I don't share a roof with them ! My father just calls me faker. Now he thinks I'm \"a bit under the weather and have trouble sleeping.\" To my stepmother, I'm just a lazyass who found depression as a convenient excuse. My mother kind of understood I'm depressed, but does not realize how bad I am right now. Even fucking psychiatrists and psychologists. I fought against my anxieties to take calls and try to reach one for an appointement. Out of the four I called, one told me to make the appointment online (he's only available in december), the second sent a text saying he can't take anyone else at the moment, and the last two did no even bother to respond. \n\nThis is a bad joke. They all say that what's important is to talk about it so you can get help. It's a fucking joke.\n\nWhy is it that the only people who support me are the one that can not help me ? I mean, I can get that they would have trouble getting it at first, or even would better think of me as a lazyass at first... But I haven't been eating in weeks, and struggled with insomnia for months.\n\nThey can't be serious. It's a bad fucking joke.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ps2oz8/why_is_it_so_hard/", "title": "Why is it so hard?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Thefrenchdude_re", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632168507, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ps2oz8/why_is_it_so_hard/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426570.5463223, "replies_charged": false}
