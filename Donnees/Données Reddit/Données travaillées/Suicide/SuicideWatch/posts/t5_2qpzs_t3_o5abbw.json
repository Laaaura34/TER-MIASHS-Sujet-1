We got into an argument because her bf kept parking outside my window and that day I bit into some tacos I had in the refrigerator and bit into glass. And I only have my siblings and bf to talk to they told me it was no big deal probably taco bell. So I ordered from a different location yesterday and bit into one today and found glass again it cut my mouth and I spit it out but my stomachs been having on and off sharp pains for hours. \nI'm so sad all the time I just got a job and I can't focus for it. I think I ate glass and I can't afford to go to the doctor and I don't have a ride. If I go I'll miss work n be fired. So I'm stick in bed in pain crying and I just want to die. I don't want to be here sad and afraid to eat anything. I spend all my money on grocers and those tacos and now I can't eat anything else today or I won't have food and I can only eat an apple for breakfast and my prepacked meals for lunch for the rest of the week. I only have 4 left. \nBut I know it's my aunt putting glass in my food I probably ate some and I have no one who cares enough to ask me if I'm ok. I just want it to stop.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o5abbw/my_aunt_keeps_putting_glass_in_my_food_i_think_i/", "title": "My aunt keeps putting glass in my food I think I swallowed some.
