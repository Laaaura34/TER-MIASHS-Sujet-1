I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about my day or the shitty things I experienced or share a favorite show or funny experience with. I literally talk to no one. I\u2019ve had a significant other on and off for years but her favorite this to do is block me and cut me off for weeks if I don\u2019t agree with her on something she wants me to do. She knows exactly what she is doing by isolating me. She knows I have no friends and I sit here alone ruminating over worries with no adult to have a conversation with. I work from home so no colleagues to interact with either. I really can\u2019t go on like this.
