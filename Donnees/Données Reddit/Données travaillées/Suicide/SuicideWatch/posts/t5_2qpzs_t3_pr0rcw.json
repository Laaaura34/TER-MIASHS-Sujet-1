My mom tried to calm us down because she was scared for safety and dad told her to shut up and said he was leaving. Something about Jesus and left.\n\nDuring the argument he asked me what I wanted, but I didn't answer. He tried to take my silence and mock me with it, but I knew what I wanted. I know what I want. I just want to be held, I want to feel loved, I want to be ok, to know it will be ok. I want to be normal. I want to be happy. I want what I can never have.\n\nI don't know what will happen next. Lately Ive stopped caring and feeling. The thought of killing myself is lesson taboo and more comforting. Ive known for a long time that all Ive needed is the right push.
