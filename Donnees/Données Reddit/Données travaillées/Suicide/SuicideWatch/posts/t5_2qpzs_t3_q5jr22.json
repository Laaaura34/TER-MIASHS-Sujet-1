So many people come to me when they\u2019re struggling, because I\u2019m the guy who is always laughing and joking. But every time I look at them and smile, I say to myself \u201cthey have no idea how dark things are for me too\u201d.\n\nThough the method I\u2019ve planned and think about each day is gas-based, using my mathematics and science skill set to make sure it is meticulous, I will never discuss it in detail for fear of a copycat from someone reading this.\n\nThe most worrying thing for me is that I\u2019ve easily come to terms with it. Though a lot of people have hurt me, let me down and turned their back on me in the past, the note I\u2019ve written basically just says that I am incredibly sorry and that absolutely nobody should feel any guilt or blame. Because my brain has let me down at the end of the day, not other people.\n\nI know I\u2019m very sick.
