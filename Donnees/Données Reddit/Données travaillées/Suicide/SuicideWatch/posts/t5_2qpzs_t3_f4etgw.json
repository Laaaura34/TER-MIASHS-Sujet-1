I know that relationships are not everything of life but I just can't  find who I am anymore. \n\nThere are two girls involved in my situation:Girl A and Girl B. I was dating B before I was dating A. Me and B were together for over a year and we just got comfortable with just being together even though I was not that in love with her. A is B's best friend. B went away for the summer for a job and I hung out with A more and more. I fell in love with A. I cheated on B with A, but I knew when I fell in love with A I was going to break up with B and I pushed her away when I cheated on her, but nonetheless I still cheated on her. Being with A, made me realize what I wanted in love. \n\nWhen she got back from her job, A told me I should wait a month before breaking up with B. It took 3 days, because I knew I wanted to be with A. We didn't start dating right after I broke up with B. It was hard because she was trying to be there for B while also being there for me, but she said she loved me. It felt like she would rather spend time with B more than me. I saw a counselor at the time and my coping method was just talking to people to air out my feelings because I knew my feelings for her were real and genuine. My counselor said I couldn't control her actions and behavior. A is bisexual, at the same time she started developing feelings for B. And when I found out I was torn and I would've disappeared when I found out. Then I told B about me and A. \n\nA chose me. I wanted to give the best of the world to A. I would shower her in my love and do thoughtful things she would like. I would buy her flowers and always helped her if she needed any help. I felt happy, not only because I got to be with her, but because I got to show her how much I loved her and how much she meant to me. \nBut B was still wanting to be friends with A. I was fine with them being friends, but looking back on it, it didn't make sense to me. Why would she still want to be friends even when they did have feelings for each other.\nMe and A were going good until she decided to go back to her hometown for a weekend. She was hiding the fact that she was taking B with her. When she got back I asked her if she was hiding anything from me. She was hiding that she thinks shes gay and that she took B with her. A week later, I looked into A's phone and found out shes been texting B, but the texts include \"you should stop staying at his house, you can stay at mine when we start dating.\" I felt betrayed. A started to hide more stuff from me. I saw her indecisiveness. I confronted her about it. She said she would see a counselor. Being confused about your sexuality is one thing but being noncommittal to your current relationship is another. I didn't understand. She saw B again before seeing her counselor and also hid that from me. When she saw her counselor, the counselor said staying in a relationship where her sexuality wasn't right would complicate things. Then we decided to separate.\n\nWhat I'm feeling right now is that I put everything into the relationship and I get nothing out of it. She's confused about her sexuality but she knows she loves me. I don't feel like my life is my own to control. I don't have a grasp for it anymore. I don't know who I am anymore. I'm scared of what I'll become. I feel like I should give up. I know the relationship didn't define me. I know her journey doesn't determine my worth. But I feel like shit. I think I deserve better. I feel like I deserve to die. I can't look at myself in the mirror because the person staring back at me hates me. I have been hurting myself. I feel alone. I feel that there is nothing tying me to this earth.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f4etgw/i_dont_deserve_to_exist/", "title": "I don't deserve to exist", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Kimi_ga_kureta_mono", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1581797060, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f4etgw/i_dont_deserve_to_exist/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426689.442364, "replies_charged": false}
