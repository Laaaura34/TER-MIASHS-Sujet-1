After being part of a trial drug study, he has been cancer free for a few years and is tentatively being called \u201ccured\u201d for now. Yay! Then several weeks ago, he had a rare kind of stroke that caused he to go basically blind in both eyes. He is not handling it well. He\u2019s been a truck driver forever so now he has to retire early under disability and he can\u2019t do any of the little stuff he used to. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s the hardest for him, the little stuff he enjoys. Not being able to make coffee and toast in the morning. Can\u2019t watch Wheel of Fortune. Can\u2019t drive himself places. \n\nLately he\u2019s been saying these really depressing things and it\u2019s really worrying me. Like I asked him what he wants for Christmas and he said \u201cnothing, I can\u2019t find joy in anything cause I can\u2019t see it.\u201d  I found him sitting with his head in his hands and I asked if he had a headache. He said no and I just said it\u2019s going to be ok. He responded with \u201cno it\u2019s not ok, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\nI really think he is going to commit suicide and I can\u2019t handle it. He is my best friend and I don\u2019t know what to say to him without making it about me and how I feel.\n\nAny advice on what to do?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pvmk2r/i_think_my_dad_is_thinking_about_committing/", "title": "I think my Dad is thinking about committing suicide and I don\u2019t know what to do.
