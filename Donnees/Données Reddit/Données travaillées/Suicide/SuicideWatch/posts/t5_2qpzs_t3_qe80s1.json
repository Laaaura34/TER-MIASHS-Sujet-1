We didn't actually see any broken thermometers, but we did find mercury. My parents downplayed the risk that mercury poses to the human body, and we obviously haven't disposed of the mercury correctly.\nThe mercury has probably spread around the house quite a bit, which means that we'll be inhaling mercury vapors.\nThis has made me consider killing myself since I can't cope with the idea of mercury changing my personality and making me less intelligent.\nWhat should I do? I don't know if they'd be willing, for example, to throw away the blanket where sone of the mercury was spilled. They are probably just going to put it in the laundry machine.\nI don't know if this post is appropriate for SuicideWatch, since I'm not truly considering it. The thought's there, though.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qe80s1/mercury_poisoning_and_ending_it_all/", "title": "Mercury poisoning and ending it all", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mercurydeath2", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635006198, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qe80s1/mercury_poisoning_and_ending_it_all/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427930.09219, "replies_charged": false}
