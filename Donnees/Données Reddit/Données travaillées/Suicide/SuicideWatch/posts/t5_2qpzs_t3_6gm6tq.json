I have struggled with being depressed most of my adult/adolescent life. I get what people are saying when they say like \"think of good things that could happen in future etc\" but at the same time every moment feels like constant emotional pain and anxiety in my head. It's so constant and strong it inhibits my ability to function correctly alot of the time. People also say think of friends and families reactions etc but idk if that thought overrides how terrible I feel all the time\n\nSorry if this breaks any rules, thanks for reading\n\n\nJust wondering if anyone maybe has some new ideas or basic things that could maybe push me in the right direction or convince me away from suicidal thoughts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6gm6tq/unsure/", "title": "Unsure.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "depressedthrow224", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1497197671, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6gm6tq/unsure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426476.3462992, "replies_charged": false}
