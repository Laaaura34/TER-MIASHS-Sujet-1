I\u2019ve always dealt with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thought. I hate myself for being like that, sometimes I make myself so uncomfortable that I want to rip my own skin off. My girlfriend broke up with me recently and I feel like I\u2019ve just lost a part of me too. This world is so mean and unkind and I feel like since we\u2019re all gonna die anyway why not? I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going or if I want to go anywhere anymore. I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019ve always been different to everyone and this world just wasn\u2019t meant for me. Ive lost all motivation for anything. All the things that I do care about don\u2019t really care for me or I fuck up in some way. I\u2019ve been told that I care to much, is that a bad thing? Why the fuck am I here? Why am I always in pain? What\u2019s the point in anything? All I want to do is sleep but I deal with insomnia so I can\u2019t all that much. I\u2019m so tired all I want to do is go to sleep forever and never wake up. Someone help me I\u2019m scared and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be around for much longer.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qg39fl/is_it_worth_it_why_should_i_keep_going/", "title": "Is it worth it?
