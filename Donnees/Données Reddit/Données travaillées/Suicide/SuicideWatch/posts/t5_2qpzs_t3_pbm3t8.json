Tell me all that stuff I already know, that I've already heard a million times. That I'm living life on easy mode. That I don't have to hide my emotions. That it's easier to get laid. That people at least pretend to care about me. That I don't have as many expectations placed on me.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, none of that shit is gonna change how I feel about myself. At the end of the day I'm left here, the weaker sex, the dumber sex, the emotional sex. Imagine being even lower than the lowest male with absolutely nothing you can do about it.\n\nIf I suck at something, I suck at it because I'm a woman. When I play video games, when I get lost driving, when I have to take a few extra seconds to add some simple numbers together. Every little thing I do all comes back to this one fucking thing. That I'm a woman. And I just fucking hate it.
