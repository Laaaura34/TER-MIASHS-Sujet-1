Back in June, I went out on a very similar escape, only I just went a little into the woods behind our backyard. Reason I do this is because I\u2019d rather not die in a painful way, and dehydrating myself is something I\u2019m down to endure.\n\nWhat can I say? I\u2019m a monster. And no matter how good I try to be, I still can\u2019t control myself from letting people down or acting like a moron in general. That\u2019s only the beginning. I\u2019m not able to drive, lacks intelligence basic humans have, and obtain hardly any skills whatsoever. It\u2019s unbearable just thinking about it.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point if you\u2019re gonna be miserable about not being able to live a life like most others?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqyg6j/second_suicide_attempt_didnt_go_so_well/", "title": "Second suicide attempt didn\u2019t go so well", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BentendoGameBoi", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632013848, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqyg6j/second_suicide_attempt_didnt_go_so_well/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428519.7658293, "replies_charged": false}
