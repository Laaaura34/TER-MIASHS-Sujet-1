But the thing that sucks is knowing i will leave my family suffering. I promised my sister i wouldn't ever try to kill myself again. But i can't tell them i'm not fine, i've never been able to talk about my emotions, every time i try my mouth glues shut or i feel stupid afterwards and never do it again. I feel broken and not real.  I've tried to live. Not for myself but for my family. But i just can't do that anymore. Why can't i just kill myself without feeling that stupid sense of guilt?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qg68as/guilt/", "title": "Guilt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "HotSauce452", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635254344, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qg68as/guilt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426169.8921173, "replies_charged": false}
