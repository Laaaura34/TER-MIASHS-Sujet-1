What were some financial/otherwise unexpected issues you faced from having a loved one or family member pass away? \n\nI plan on ending things here in the next few months. I have approximately 20k in tuition debt, 27k financing, and I work have a well-paying job and my life insurance policy has been set for one of my oldest friends. My name is signed to this lease and I have three roommates. We are all co-tenants. \n\nI am not looking to really explain myself. I just want to know how people have suffered unexpectedly because I need to know how to  mitigate the consequences of what most would consider a 'selfish act'. But in reality, its a part of human natures. Suicidal behavior exists in nature, and we are no different. \n\nPrimarily I've organized these consequences into:\n\n1. **Housing**: move out when I get my next paycheck, however, under housing laws in my state we are all considered as one tenant. So if I kill myself then they are not only stuck with dealing with my remains, but the remainder of the lease that I would have paid. Thankfully my landlord is amazing. he is willing to let me work off the debt in the event that my existing roommates deny all possible sublease tenants. I can wait a few months to at least give them that assurance.\n   1. Solution: Move out, wait for someone else to be accepted otherwise wait until August before ending things. That way there is no possible repercussion on those that I live with, and they won't need to be stressed. \n2. **Debts**: There is no way to clear the tuition + car + credit cards. But thankfully I have been independent since college. Everything is in my name\n   1. Question: They can't go after my family right? For example, I have a half-brother in cali I don't speak to. Dad is also there but he is retired and dying. Mom abandoned the states and me in hs but she still speaks with me every week or so via kakao. I know they can't get to her because she left because of money issues when I said I would live with my dad, so she can't come back without getting arrested. \n3. **Friends/Family:** Until the lease terminates (or if we find a replacement sooner) I plan on writing letters to every person that has every been apart of my life.\n   1. Question:  In your experience was it helpful to have a letter? I would think so. But there are people who don't necessarily have to know what happens. IMO people tend to be caught up in their own lives, and may hear of it and be sad for a moment. But how do I know who to make sure knows that it wasn't their fault? \n4. **Work/Co-Workers:** I work in a high stress development environment. I am being groomed for lead, and noone else on the team is prepared to take over. On top of that, our team has a lot of eyes on us -- if I'm out, everything tends to fall apart. \n   1. My solution: One of the roommates (same person who will receive my life insurance payout, known him since hs) lacks confidence but I believe he would actually do well as lead if he got the support and time he needed. I gave him all my notes and I will be training him personally for the next few months everything I know about development. I will be making aggressive moves to position him to be the lead, and I have no doubt he will be successful in life.  I have already written my resignation letter with exact instructions and advice for who I believe should take over, and my recommendations. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat am I missing here?
