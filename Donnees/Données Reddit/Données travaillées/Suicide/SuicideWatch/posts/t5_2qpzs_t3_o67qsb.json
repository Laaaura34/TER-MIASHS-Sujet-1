I\u2019ve felt like shit for the last 2 weeks and there moments of happiness but for what? It\u2019s not like anything I do will ever have a impact on anything, yeah I may influence someone close but to what extent every time I\u2019ve seen my actions influence someone it\u2019s for the worst because of this dumb ideology that nothing ever matters and that sadness and suicidal thinking will be the only experience I\u2019ll have in my life and I should just be happy that I\u2019m even alive living a useless life, give my time and energy to some greater goal that I\u2019ll never see cause I\u2019ll end up just putting a bullet through my brain.
