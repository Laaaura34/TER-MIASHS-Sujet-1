I\u2019m writing this around 11 est. I\u2019m 18 years old, first year college student and I can\u2019t see myself living by the end of this year. \n\nI\u2019m so distant from my family, I never felt like I belonged. My friendships aren\u2019t genuine, there\u2019s never a follow up to hang out. I hate my physical appearance, short, skinny, ugly, crooked teeth, weak.. Constant comments from people around me talking about my height or arms, I know they\u2019re laughing at me. I hate myself so much. \n\nI\u2019ve never belonged with any group, people just don\u2019t like me and I\u2019ve tried so fucking hard. The fire and drive I used to have is all used up. I know it\u2019ll break my moms heart but if I\u2019m dead I won\u2019t have to think about it. Ive wasted so much time feeling like this I\u2019m tired of dragging it on. Life is hard and not for everyone, especially not for me.
