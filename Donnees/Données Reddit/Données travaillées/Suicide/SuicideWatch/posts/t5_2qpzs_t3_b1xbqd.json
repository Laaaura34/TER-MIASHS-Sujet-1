I live in a very toxic borderline abusive house right now (me, my twin sister, single mother and older sister) Me and my mom never had a very good relationship, we fight all the time. my mom doesn\u2019t get along well with any of my siblings for the matter of fact. My mom is diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder but doesn\u2019t take medicine as she doesn\u2019t believe in mental health. I myself was diagnosed with depression and adhd 2 weeks ago (I\u2019m really starting to think im bipolar aswell) and i got prescribed lexapro. My mom never believed i had anything wrong with me even though there are crystal clear signs, she didn\u2019t even take me to the doctor to get tested, my older sister had to because she refuses to. my mom has told me on multiple occasions ever since i\u2019ve been prescribed that i\u2019m lying about having a mental illness and that they don\u2019t even exist. she came into my room today and told me \u201cif you want to pretend to be a crazy person, go and live at a mental hospital where all the other fucked up people go, i don\u2019t care, nothings stopping you\u201d and proceed to hide my anti-depressants. This all happened because i asked my mom last night if i could go see a movie with one of my closest friends and get sushi (spring break started yesterday, it was a friday night, everyone was out having fun) and instead of saying just yes or no she went on a rant about how i\u2019m a terrible person and that i\u2019m killing her and that i\u2019m not going anywhere, she started calling the friend that i was supposed to go with racist names (she\u2019s brown) and belittling all indians and white people aswell (idk what white people had to do with this, i just wanted to watch how to train your dragon) my mom is a ticking time bomb and this has been happening constantly for years. i don\u2019t feel safe around her, i can\u2019t talk to her about anything. whenever i\u2019m about to come home from school i cry because of how afraid i am to go home. i was gonna kill myself last night but i\u2019ve changed my mind. i\u2019m very unstable at the moment. nothing excites me. I\u2019m extremely empty, i feel nothing and nothing scares me anymore. I\u2019ve been feeling like this for a while and i use self harm to cope but it doesn\u2019t work anymore. my mom is extremely toxic. i know she\u2019s dealing with her own problems but she\u2019s a constant roller coaster and i don\u2019t even talk to her anymore. i don\u2019t leave the house. i just sit in my room. when i stay in my room and do nothing she gets mad at me and calls me lazy and when i ask her to go out she gets mad at me and makes a huge scene and tells me no. she doesn\u2019t want me having friends and tells me that my friends are dumb and makes fun of them when i try bringing them up. she gets mad at me every single day and makes snarky remarks too, i don\u2019t remember the last time i\u2019ve felt genuine love from her. i don\u2019t even know how to love. tomorrow night i\u2019m gonna \u201crun away\u201d (not really, just spending a couple nights at a friends) my mom doesn\u2019t know about this bc i\u2019ll be sneaking out tmr night and my friend will come pick me up. i hate this house so much, if i stay here and stay with my mom i know i\u2019ll end up killing myself. i\u2019m not afraid of dying at all. i know this is really dark but this is just how i feel. i don\u2019t really know what to do. i\u2019ve been seriously depressed since i was a child and tried killing myself three times. i told my mom that and she couldn\u2019t care less about it. i\u2019m gonna write a note and put it on my bed tmr, i already packed some clothes, my makeup etc and brang some money with me.\n\n\nTLDR; my mom is crazy and invalidates me and my mental health issues in every way possible. either planning on killing myself or running away in the next couple days lol.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/b1xbqd/im_either_going_to_run_away_tomorrow_night_or/", "title": "I\u2019m either going to run away tomorrow night or kill myself.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "annabananue", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1552770301, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/b1xbqd/im_either_going_to_run_away_tomorrow_night_or/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426262.4526472, "replies_charged": false}
