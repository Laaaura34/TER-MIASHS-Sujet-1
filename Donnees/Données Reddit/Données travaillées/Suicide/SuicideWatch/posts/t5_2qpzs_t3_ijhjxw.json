She was 13 and I was 14. She was the most beautiful girl, I\u2019ve seen until then. I saw her in school by accident. To what can I remember? Everything. She had flashing grey-blue eyes and long, blonde har. I even remember exacly what she was wearing that day, a black open jacket, a blue top and a leggings. Her smile was tangled up in my memories.\n\nAt the age of 14 you are usually very insecure when you have fallen in love and so I just kept quiet about her. I just couldn't tell her that I fell in love with her at first sight. I talked to my classmates about her, and that's how the wrong people found out that I was interested in her. I was threatened, attacked, not only verbally but also physically, and even went so far that one day I ended up in hospital for several days. All because I fell in love with this girl who didn't even know who I am.\n\nMy best friend then decided to help me get to know L. After one of the last assaults, we decided that we wanted to develop further musically and put in jam sessions in the breaks. He invited L to join us. We hardly spoke a word to each other because I was just too shy, but I can still remember how beautiful I found her. Right now, I feel very melancholy.\n\nOn a dingy, typically rainy day in Hamburg, I was sitting in the subway, we were just leaving the Hammerbrook station with a good view of the Hamburg harbour, and I remember as if it had only been yesterday, when I got at that moment a friend request from her on Facebook. Was I excited? Yes. You'd think we guys are always really tough and don't want to show anything, but believe me, my hands were shaking when I wrote to her, I was so excited.\n\nSo she had found out that someone was secretly in love with her and she now wanted to know who it was. I could actually imagine that she already knew, and yet I even denied it and kept my feelings from her. Who knew why she was really writing to me? I wanted to get to know her first before I fell in the house with the door. We didn't meet that often at school anymore, maybe once a week, but after that we would write together every day. At first about the weather and other irrelevant things and slowly got to know each other better.\n\nWe decided to meet. On December 9th, 2012 the time had finally come, we went to the cinema together. We watched the James Bond movie Skyfall together. It was a really nice evening. However, we weren't alone, I asked my best friend to come with me. This was done with the thought that I didn't want to let her go home alone, nothing should happen to her. I couldn't accompany them because my subway was going in a different direction. We were children, I also had to be at home at some point. This way, however, I was able to confide the girl I was in love with to my best friend. I was reassured when she wrote me that she had arrived home safely.\n\nIn the New Year, however, the dynamics of our online friendship changed a little. It felt to me like I was like an online diary for her, that she could comfort and talk to about all of her problems. She told me about her friends and how they kept talking about all the things that could be done. However, that was still very harmless. That she hated the way her parents argued and that she couldn't get on with it. In addition, I found out that she had a friend called T. who, as I found out later, was much older than L. and she hated having to carry his things around all the time. I was also very worried about her, because she kept writing to me that she was going to party and this ended up with the fact that she had often drank excessively much.\n\nIn spring, she really revealed herself and told me that her boyfriend forced her to run around half-naked in the apartment of total strangers in another part of town. That he abused her as a drug courier at school and that she baked hash cookies for him. In all honesty, I was shocked and really overwhelmed with the situation.\n\nI didn't really know what to do with this situation, so I turned to our tutor. I also told my older brother about the drugs part, who then called the police with me, who then carried out a large-scale drug raid in the school a few days later.\n\nMeanwhile I met L. and I asked her what was going on because she looked a little desperate and I wanted to know what was bothering her. She just said she had drugs and syringes with her and didn't know what to do with them. Since I was absolutely sure that I would not be checked, I took these things and threw them away outside the school premises. With that and with the fact that I told the police in an interrogation that L. had nothing to do with the matter, I managed to ensure that you had less trouble as a result.\n\nHowever, it was not until summer that we finally got together. Although their parents didn't know me, they didn't like me and nobody wanted us to be together. Unfortunately. After just a week, she broke up with me again. Whether it was because of her family and friends, or whether she just lost a bet and used me, I don't know. It hit me so hard that I first went to a friend near Hanover for a few days. However, I had to go back to Hamburg because school would soon start again, but what I knew very well was that I could no longer go to the same school as L. It just wasn't possible for me. When I told my parents I wanted to change schools, they didn't listen to me and I told them I was going to run away. However, they didn't believe me.\n\nI then just took the regional train to Hanover, but my friend, who I stayed with last time, didn't have time this time, so I decided to go to my grandma's. I called her and she asked me if I was totally crazy now, but then picked me up at the train station around midnight and took me in first.\n\nSince my parents didn't want to help me, I called the youth welfare office myself the next morning and asked them to help me change schools. Not only because I was still in love with L and it was horrible just to think that I would see her again, but also that I knew I was going to be threatened and attacked all over again and I wouldn't be another year withstand. What I also had to find out is that my best friend was with L now. He was my best friend now, of course, as you can imagine. I was not only disappointed with my first love, but also with my supposed best friend.\n\nWhen you're so young and hurt like that by your girlfriend, your best friend, the situation can quickly slip out of your hands. I wanted her back, but I also knew that wasn't possible. Desperate as I was, I turned to my friend P. and talked to her about it. I told her that my life no longer had any sense. The attacks at school, L.'s false declarations of love and that my best friend could stab me in the back like that were just too much for me and I wanted to put an end to my life and made my way to the train station. As it turned out later, the police were looking for me. I don't remember who called her or even why, I just remember that someone tried to reach me and then I picked up the phone. I said where I was, the police came and asked me what I was doing today, and I said I want to go home to my grandma and sleep. They called my grandma, who came and picked me up. We didn't want to tell my parents this so as not to worry them and so that I could be with my grandma longer, but someone still whistled me at my parents' house. They asked me to come home as quickly as possible, which I did on the same day. They worried about me so much that they first drove me to a clinic so I could confide in a professional therapist.\n\nThe therapists have decided to keep me in the clinic for three days and to discuss a further course of treatment with me. Whatever it took, I really had trouble dealing with the whole situation. During the visiting hours, I also had the opportunity to write L once, I reproached her and told her how much she had hurt me and how immature I was, and I blamed her for everything.\n\nWe then discussed with the youth welfare office how my school career could be continued. You have assured me that I no longer have to go to the Finkenwerder district school. A week later, I had an interview at a boarding school, which went well. After the youth welfare office had clarified the financial aspect, it was clear that I could attend boarding school. Finally, I would just concentrate on school again. Finally away from school where I just had bad experiences and into a new future.\n\nOn a weekend in the middle of the school year, I moved into the boarding school. I was looking forward to it so much and made new friends quickly. Nevertheless, the past never completely let go of me and I thought of L every now and then. What she's doing and how she's doing. My best friends at boarding school should be H and M. I confided in them and told them about L and the whole story.\n\nThey said that if I want to finish with the past, it might be wise to make an appointment with the counseling teacher at the old school in Finkenwerder for a discussion. Said and done. We let ourselves be exempted from lessons that day and went to Hamburg. When I got back to the old crime scene, I realized how much I had suffered when I was at this school and if my best friends hadn't been with me, I would probably have simply not entered the building. Nevertheless, we went in and my former best friend and another student who had bullied me mentally and physically showed up for discussion. My best friend spoke for L because she didn't show up. I asked him to tell her to tell me what to expect from me.\n\nIn an online support group I told my story and the moderators added L too and she then apologized to me for the first time, I can't say she was serious, but at least she tried. I just wanted her to finally understand that she had hurt me, but she didn't want to admit it because she was making it look like it just didn't matter. However, she couldn't decide what is important to me. Still, I simply offered her my friendship to show her that I could forgive her.\n\nWhen I was visiting my grandparents on vacation, L wrote to me that she had broken up with her boyfriend. I told her that I thought it was a shame, but deep down inside of me there was the slightest spark of hope that I might get another chance after all. Of course I knew this was crazy, but why not? Hope hasn't hurt anyone, has it? Still, my reasonable part stuck to the fact that friendship in the broadest sense was the most desirable part. However, L stayed single for the time being, which I think was very good for her. We continued to write every day and it became a bit more familiar again from her side, whether I could get involved and wanted to I didn't know yet, but it was nice to recognize the old L again, the girl I had fallen in love with at the time .\n\nIt was still some time before we would meet again. It was over two years since I last saw her. She told me that I would really like to see each other again and I asked her if we wanted to go to the cinema together. We met in front of the cinema in Orthmaschener Park. We decided to see Paper Towns. As I waited for her, I just hoped that she wouldn't cancel at the last minute, but she came. It felt like it was yesterday the last time we met. The movie was good.\n\nAt the invitation of a friend, I flew to Mallorca 2 days after this meeting. What can I say about it? It was pretty nice in the hospital. I just passed out upon arrival and had to stay in the hospital for two weeks, the length of my entire vacation. When I told L. that, she was quite aloof, which surprised me a bit, but we stayed in contact.\n\nSince I couldn't start my training this year because I was supposed to do my A-Levels, we decided that I could go back to school in the 11th grade in order to better prepare for my A-Levels. However, the age difference between my classmates and me became an increasing problem, so I was placed in grade 12. In this class, N. became my best friend over time. We became more and more personable over time.\n\nL. was still a part of my life, but she kept me very at a distance, her signals were very contradictory. She told me how much she liked me and now she told me that there was nothing more she could gave me than phone calls, Skype video calls and messages. We even met again, but this meeting was strange and somewhat biased. Why? I don't know any more today. However, after a few weeks L decided that she would like to see me more often, which is what, happened.\n\nAlthough I wanted it so badly, I could never quite overcome what L. had done to me a few years ago and so I remained a little distant from her inside. The time in the district school in Finkenwerder, which was bullied and also the physical attacks, I was not able to overcome on my own and in order to come to terms with this past and also with the L, I decided to admit myself to a psychosomatic clinic in another district allow. I left this after 3 weeks because I felt better.\n\nWhat I achieved through this was that L was also thinking about getting help and that was really important. She not only struggled with self-harm, but also with suicidal thoughts and I was glad that she would finally get help.\n\nWe used the time before to discuss how we wanted to stay in touch because they couldn't take their cell phone with them. She was allowed to leave the clinic for an hour every evening and we met to go to grocery store together, where I bought her little treats to cheer her up a little. I visited her on the weekends, either Saturday or Sunday, and brought her flowers and presents.\n\nShe started by talking to me about what it would be like if we had sex. Which moment would be perfect for it and of course I couldn't defend myself when the time came.\n\nWhat I still can't say to this day is whether she had feelings for me or whether I was just the one who was at hand to take comfort in cold and bleak nights. My infatuation changed and I developed deeper feelings for her.\n\nL. and continued to see each other and I felt very good with her at the time, we had a really nice relationship, at least that's how I felt. However, she began to distance herself from me again, she made me feel that everything else was becoming more important and just left me in the dark, and that was unfair. I didn't know how to proceed, but I knew what I wanted, but what she couldn't tell me was what she wanted. It became calmer around her and I found myself again in a situation in which I felt lost. Why couldn't I just get a clear message? It's over, I don't love you, what's so hard about that? You stay with me for whatever reason.\n\nOne evening I was supposed to find out what was bothering her, she called me and told me that she was pregnant. I cannot and I do not want to go into further detail on this subject, but I can tell you one thing: I would never have left her alone, regardless of whether it is my child or even if it were not, she and I would always have been welcome with her child would have supported her. (In case you're wondering, I won't mention the child in the rest of the text).\n\nWe talked about what we wanted and how we would proceed with our relationship. She decided that we'd keep seeing each other but she didn't want a relationship, so we agreed that we'd see it as Friends with Benefits. Of course, that hurt me, but I accepted it as well. Love is a strange game, as the saying goes.\n\nWe saw each other for the last time this year on St. Nicholas Day and we already gave each other our Christmas presents because we didn't know whether we would see each other again before Christmas. We wrote to each other repeatedly and her behaviour made me sad, but we still stay in contact. I didn't want to rush her and give her the time she apparently needed. The next time we saw each other again in February. We wanted to see each other more often and then we did. All that was missing now was just our place of retreat. Our own little paradise just for us, without parents, because until then we could only meet in uncomfortable places, such as in a toy house and sometimes in your mother's garage. In the latter, we had really uncomfortable sex, which probably led to my looking for an apartment even faster.\n\nThis year she gave me an iPhone cake that had a weight of 5 kilos, of course I picked up L and helped her carry it. She also showed me with the many small gifts that she really cares about me, who else would do such a job. She couldn't stay for the birthday dinner, but I was glad I saw her that day. She had promised me that we could finally see each other more often. If only I had already known that, these are empty promises.\n\nIt hurt a lot that she had moved me over and over again. She promised me that she wanted to see me and that she would come over and still had new excuses. She played this game for weeks. The last excuse of the day was that she had to take care of a dog and therefore couldn't come over to see me. She wrote me a few more alarming messages and then explained to me that she never wanted to see me again and that she ended our relationship, or what was left of it. After that, she just blocked me everywhere.\n\nAfter a long back and forth I decided to contact her mother and tell her that I am worried about L and why. L's mother didn't want to believe me and then just ended the conversation, but before that I got her email address and was able to send her the proof that she was entitled to worry. After that, I first distanced myself from L and her family.\n\nI distracted myself from L and didn't want to contact her anymore. Actually, I really only wanted to hear a reason from her once, once, more than just blocking. What I would have liked to has been honesty and not games, stalling techniques or the like. I fell for her again and again, but this time I wanted to stay strong and decided to let her go.\n\nI spent a lot of time in front of the PC with my best friend and we played games. When I then realized that I was hanging out in front of the PC for too much time, I decided to visit my grandma. That was a really good idea.\n\nAs a big Apple fanboy (yes, I stand by it) I wanted to go to an Apple Store again. I was considering buying an iPhone 7 and when I told the saleswoman that I had received a job offer from Apple but declined, she asked me not to tell the manager and said that would be pretty stupid of me been. Therefore, it was clear that I would go back to the Internet to find out how I could get a job at Apple.\n\nIn July 2017, I had the approval from Apple and would start at Apple in August. I flew from Hamburg to Heathrow and from there to Cork. First I was able to stay in a hotel and after a few days I temporarily moved in with an employee and when I had to move out of her house, I was only able to move in with my new roommate the next day, so I put my things there, but up the night spent the road. When I looked at the sky like that, I missed L. again for the first time and when it occurred to me that I now have an Irish number, I thought so, even if it's strange, I would like to see her again Say hello. Said and done. \u201cHey L., how are you? I am fine. I now live in Ireland and work at Apple. \"\n\nWe wrote to each other again, just like that, not often and somehow the contact broke off again. I had settled in well in Ireland, made new friends and also enjoyed my work. I spent my first Christmas alone in Ireland because we are also open at Christmas. When I was, so alone, I treated myself to a little wine and then I thought how unwise it would be a smart idea to wish L a Merry Christmas.\n\nMonths later, I just congratulated her on her birthday and this time, we wrote to each other more and more regularly. It started off harmlessly again, we chat about irrelevant things and from Christmas 2018 this informality became more and more. More closeness, even when we were so far apart. We called regularly, we used Skype. It was then every day and I was happy about it. I started to give her presents again and she accepted them with thanks. She started telling me again that she still had feelings for me and that she loved me. I wish that we could finally manage to relate like adults. We talked a lot and I decided to go back to Germany to give us a chance. Maybe I was too hasty, maybe she just sounded like more than she could give me, and however, on April 29, 2019 I flew back to Germany.\n\nWe wrote to each other, we spoke on the phone, but we haven't met yet because she was living in Spain at the time. We have arranged a meeting for September, Friday the 13th. I booked a hotel room because I didn't know whether I would be living alone until then or with my parents.\n\nWe were so happy that we would finally meet again after more than two years. 190 days to go! In the meantime, I had found my own apartment here in Germany. We were both so excited about this news. It got even better when she informed me that she had decided not only to go on vacation in Germany, but also to come back for a longer period of time.\n\nOn Friday September 13th the time had come! She wrote me that she was now standing in front of the door and I was a little confused when I opened the door and there was no L, but I recognized the mistake and opened the door to the hallway. Little did I know how much I missed this now young woman. We hugged and then went out to eat. Vegan but was really good. We went back to the hotel and then talked and slept together.\n\nAfter this weekend in the hotel, I drove back in my new apartment and then had to found out again that this time there was only the next disappointment waiting for me, because this time she found a lot of excuses, not to meet me and this time, Once again she broke my heart by simply blocking me everywhere. She had already received a key to the apartment from me, which was then wrapped for me, and returned by her father.\n\nA few months later until today:\n\nOut of nowhere I got a message from her that she would like to see me again. She still loved me and she still knows how much she was looking forward to the apartment at the time and that she made the wrong decision when she blocked me back then. When you love someone, you want to believe that person, and I've done that again. She told me she didn't have the money to travel from Spain to Germany, so I offered her to pay for the petrol costs. I was so excited that we would finally meet again. Who paid most of travel expenses? I, of course.\n\nHow many times have I seen L? All three times for almost 2 months. Again, she was using me because of my feelings. What I wanted this time was a final decision from her. Whether she wants me or not, what she imagines, what I imagine, in order to what she knew until then and how it should go on. She acted weird again; just found excuses again, put me off. Until one day, she revealed to me that she was meeting another man and also sent me sexy photos of her, just as if she wanted to make me jealous. A few days later, she told me that she had had enough of me and didn't want anything more to do with me. I asked her to have a discussion and she said, well, we'll meet again to sort this out. But then she decided to cancel the whole thing and once again leave me in the dark.\n\nHere we are today. What I now know is that I will never let her take advantage of me again. That there are no more gifts and no more money, because every time she wanted to come back to me, there were demands.\n\nWriting this down helped me finally finish with it. No matter what, she'll leave me alone in the future. So far she has expected me to give her what she wants when she tells me how much she loves me and then lets me fall again as quickly as possible.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ijhjxw/the_story_between_my_ex_and_myself/", "title": "The Story between my ex and myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "theliveofmeandmy", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1598811656, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ijhjxw/the_story_between_my_ex_and_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427534.3230462, "replies_charged": false}
