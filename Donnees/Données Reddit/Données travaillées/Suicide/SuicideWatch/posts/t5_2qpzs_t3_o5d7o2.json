I can see every bone in my chest which is the hardest place in the body to lose fat and a sure sign of anorexia. I'm humiliated by my body and the way other people judge me although my everyday goal is not to look fat. It's extremely confusing. I know people can see my pain physically but I smile and dress professionally through it all, then come home and cry for hours until the next day of work. I want so bad for my heart to give in but I'm giving my body one week to get it's shit together and just die before I take matters into my own hands. I'm so so so tired of this life. Nothing left here for me. Just wanted to get that off my chest (no pun intended.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o5d7o2/im_30_years_old_and_83_lbs_i_look_dead_feel_dead/", "title": "I'm 30 years old and 83 lbs.
