It's what I've worked for since July. I've begun eating healthy, exercising and reaching for my hobbies. I am an auntie and I absolutely love my niece. I am learning spanish. I now have an amazing boyfriend. \n\nBut I feel so... empty... and heavy at the same time. I feel it physically in my throat and chest. It is like a gaping, bloody hole. I keep covering it with bandages to prevent myself from bleeding on the ones I love. I keep packing it tight with activities, books, and social plans. But I'm soaking through bandages and bleeding profusely still.\n\nI feel so heavy... I am dense and made of concrete. I am a stone on a planet where the gravity is seven times heavier than Earth. I cannot move, yet my mind is running in circles. My mind is simultaneously trying to sabotage the good I've built in my life by sinking my ship and trying to keep me afloat by bailing out the water. \n\nI'm not sure I can keep this up. My mind is fighting two fronts: Melancholy Mel and Manic Nia. I'm in the middle.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d8x583/metaphorically_speaking_of_course/", "title": "Metaphorically Speaking, Of Course.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Cam_Leon", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1569378713, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d8x583/metaphorically_speaking_of_course/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427569.3527036, "replies_charged": false}
