Having nothing to do but watch whatever is on the television because patients aren't allowed to have the remote. Being so bored that the only thing to entertain you is the horrible thoughts that led you ending up here. Eating shitty middle school cafeteria food. Being largely ignored by everyone who's supposed to be there for you. No escape of your own will, so you lie about how you feel so you can get out early so you don't miss school. \"Oh I wasn't actually attempting, I just wanted to make myself sick.\" Being forcefully reminded of all the ways you can hurt yourself when you see the specially-designed doorknobs or having to ask to borrow a pencil. Getting out finally and dealing with your family sobbing over you as if they gave a single shit before you got to this point.\n\nLesson learned, never tell anyone what I did, if I fail again.
