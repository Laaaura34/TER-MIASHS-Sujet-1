No one will ever want to be related to them \u201c that hit me pretty hard because like have u ever tried hanging urself but just can\u2019t let go , so now u are there with a rope around ur neck crying for half an hour wishing it was just easier .\n\nSometimes i wish i was able to give my life for unlucky people full of life or had the the chance to sacrifice my life saving some one, i honestly think about doing it the \u201c7 pounds\u201d movie way and just hope for forgiveness.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pzrlh6/can_someone_please_tell_me_that_things_will_be/", "title": "Can someone please tell me that things will be fine ?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Negative_Machine2322", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633165004, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pzrlh6/can_someone_please_tell_me_that_things_will_be/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428184.1564856, "replies_charged": false}
