You lose  concept of that time. Like it disappeared. When people have traumatic brain injuries/brain damage? They can change completely/forget who they are. One second somewhere/someone, next second somewhere else.\n\nAll dying is, is returning back to where we were before being alive, which is eternal oblivion. I certainly don\u2019t remember anything before I was born. Do any of you? No, because there\u2019s nothing before birth and after death. \n\nMy personality, habits, the way my brain works, my thoughts, etc have all been developed as I\u2019ve grown. They didn\u2019t magically happen when I popped out my moms vaginas. When I was born, I didn\u2019t know how to speak English/languages or what the fuck suicide was. Everything has been taught to me. \n\nAll we are, are just intelligent animals who gained the ability to experience sentience. But once your brain loses oxygen, or you have a traumatic brain injury, or your heart stops pumping. It\u2019s done. Or when you get Alzheimer\u2019s. Your thoughts, personality, memories, etc. just disappear when certain parts of your brain stop working. \n\nThe simply point is; to be able to breath, think, feel thoughts, pain, emotions, memories. You need a brain. And once you\u2019re dead you don\u2019t have a working brain anymore. \n\nA baby doesn\u2019t know what a soul is... what spirituality is... what religion is.... what manipulation is... because it\u2019s all fucking taught to us. Humans just think we\u2019re more important that we are.\n\nHopefully I\u2019ll get the courage to do it soon. And finally end this futile existence of suffering.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/piwydw/ive_just_realized_dying_isnt_actually_as_bad_as/", "title": "I\u2019ve just realized dying isn\u2019t actually as bad as it seems", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "fruitloopconnoisseur", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 294, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630924665, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/piwydw/ive_just_realized_dying_isnt_actually_as_bad_as/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425173.8588748, "replies_charged": false}
