Brother, if you saw me right now, you would think I've absolutely lost it - eyes red from crying and a laughter sounding like a bird that is choking, and it has been like this for an hour. A fucking decade of all this shit, almost to this day, and boy, I can finally let all the screaming behind. I've slowly lost all that means the most to me. First my music, then my creativity in general, then my education, then my social circle, my identity, my joy. The only people I've known for years now have been staff. All the medication, therapy, lifestyle changes, tough love, suicide hotlines, hospitals and comforting nurses in the world hasn't helped me get it back, and now, what everyone has told me wouldn't happen has happened, I've lost my entire fucking youth to mental illness. And it is at this exact moment I realize how fucked up things have gotten and that I'm merely a dried up raisin of my old self. I've done everything I could, and it wasn't enough, and no fucking way am I gonna keep trying. All the insomnia, the screaming, the isolation, the anger, depression and anxiety, at times even psychosis, I can look in the face and scream fuck you and goodbye. I may have lost, but I sure as hell feel like I've finally won. I haven't felt this alive in years, and ironically enough, it is because I'm dying.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9gtsg/holy_shit_i_cant_fucking_believe_im_finally_doing/", "title": "Holy shit, I can't fucking believe I'm finally doing this", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ambitious_Try_3587", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 151, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634406365, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9gtsg/holy_shit_i_cant_fucking_believe_im_finally_doing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426510.3656738, "replies_charged": false}
