I\u2019m almost 20 and I\u2019m getting scared for the future. I feel the a dependence on substances more than ever, taking whatever I can get and needing to smoke blunts before doing anything. I\u2019m also developing bulimia again and feel like I\u2019m going to pass out in every day things. I keep around people I know aren\u2019t good for me bc I\u2019m scared to be completely alone. My life really feels out of control and I feel like no one in my life cares when I\u2019m going through shit. I\u2019m at one of my lowest points ever and I just want to stop feeling.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mrunr6/im_losing_hope/", "title": "I\u2019m losing hope", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "flowerboyyyyy", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618542839, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mrunr6/im_losing_hope/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422928.5313282, "replies_charged": false}
