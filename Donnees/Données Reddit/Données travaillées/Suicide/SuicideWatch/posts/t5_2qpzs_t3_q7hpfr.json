I\u2019m starting to finally feel like I\u2019m reaching the end, lol.\n\nI  genuinely believe that I do not have the capacity to harm myself in any way, significantly or even slightly. So I kind of feel like I\u2019d be lying when I tell them I have \u201cintent\u201d that\u2019s more than just thoughts,  although I do have many plans I\u2019m hoping I can go through with when I\u2019ve finally reached my limit (so I\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t admit me anyway).  I\u2019m trying to weigh the pros/cons of trying to get myself admitted and  so far I\u2019ve only been able to come up with cons:\n\nMy worries/concerns:\n\n* I  have no idea how much a stay or checking myself in would cost. I  believe that this worrying would leave me off a lot worse than I am now.\n* I\u2019d also be worrying about what my friends/family are thinking while I\u2019m gone and how I'm just causing them unnecessary stress (it'd be a shock  for them as they don't know any of this)\n* I\u2019d also be worrying about missing my classes/assignments/a midterm and how I would catch up afterward\n* I feel like I\u2019d be generally miserable for however long I\u2019m there\n* I  think it might make me miserable enough to actually commit suicide after I leave, although I feel like I wouldn\u2019t be able to effectively kill myself and then would have to go through the whole process of hospitalization over again. I just don\u2019t see that many pro\u2019s in checking myself in, but I don\u2019t really know what else to do.\n\nCould anyone who\u2019s gone through the process give some guidance?\n\nThank you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7hpfr/college_student_wondering_if_checking_myself_into/", "title": "College student wondering if checking myself into a hospital would be the best option\u2014 any advice?
