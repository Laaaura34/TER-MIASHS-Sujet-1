I just wanted to bring up the fact that everything I do doesn\u2019t feel like enough, nothing feels the same anymore. Every day for a while now has felt so repetitive and I can\u2019t find things to make them go by any quicker. It hurts, I went through a rapid confusing breakup, which I still don\u2019t understand. And I still have intense feeling for her, and I hope the feelings run both ways but I\u2019m unsure. I just wanna have her back, which isn\u2019t right because she needs her time. I just feel I didn\u2019t need time away, I worked on myself before, and now being ripped away just made me confused. I\u2019m not writing this too well at the moment, I\u2019m holding back tears, I miss her a lot. I have trouble saying it back, it made her uncomfortable that I said I love her. That hurt more than I thought anything could. I just want things to go back to normal, and change is bound to happen I guess. I can\u2019t handle it anymore, it\u2019s become too much for me. I wanna end it all, I tried getting adderall, a lethal amount from a friend. I wanted the easy way out, self harm has become too much, and I just don\u2019t know what to do. I miss a lot and I know it\u2019s not gonna be the same. I hope things end up better, but for now they just keep going downhill, with slight upbringings. I truthfully don\u2019t know how much longer I can go on. I\u2019m sorry to everyone for any wrongs I may have done.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q3on9j/its_all_overwhelming/", "title": "It\u2019s all overwhelming", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "variablespace", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633660930, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q3on9j/its_all_overwhelming/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427432.2941346, "replies_charged": false}
