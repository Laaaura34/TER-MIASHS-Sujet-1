My wife had to go through and labor her, she was the most perfect baby. It\u2019s not fair and I would change spots with her if I could. I would do anything to bring her back. The hospital is having us choose a mortuary and whether to bury or cremate. We want to bury because we can\u2019t imagine destroying something we love so much. I am having a hard time burying her because she will only know being alone and it\u2019s killing me. I want to be with her whether in this plane or the next. The only thing keeping me going is my wife, I can\u2019t bare to think what this would to do her, but I want to be with my baby girl.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqgrkt/lost_my_daughter_today/", "title": "Lost my daughter today", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Hrquestion92", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 35, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631944099, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqgrkt/lost_my_daughter_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426723.1192558, "replies_charged": false}
