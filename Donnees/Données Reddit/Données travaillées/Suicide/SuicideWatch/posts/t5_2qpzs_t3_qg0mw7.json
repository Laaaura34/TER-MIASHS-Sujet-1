She says she would never actually do it. Just some context she's been extremely overwhelmed with school, parents, and a head injury. A Mild concussion is when everything started. She says she feels sad all the time and sometimes doesn't feel anything at all. It's also getting progressively worse. Her parents are well a rough group of people and for their beliefs they disapprove of me or anyone for that matter. But they are very controlling and manipulative she's trying to get out of their reach but currently that just not a possibility until atleast a few more months. How can I help, or how can I convince her to maybe drop school course load or seek professional licensed therapy. It pains me to see her like this and we've been dealing with it for a month now she describes it as depression but it's undiagnosed so I have not clue.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qg0mw7/depressed_so/", "title": "Depressed s/o", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway38473727j", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635231089, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qg0mw7/depressed_so/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422902.9578202, "replies_charged": false}
