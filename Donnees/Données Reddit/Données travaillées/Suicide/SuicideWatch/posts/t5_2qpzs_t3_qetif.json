My body is covered with scars and stretch marks from years of not just neglect, but active malignance. My cesspool genetics left me with nothing exemplary, just this stocky frame where everything\u2019s underdeveloped and nothing works right. I\u2019m quite literally a Neanderthal, and I\u2019m naturally repulsive.\n\nThere\u2019s a parasite in my psyche that simultaneously outwardly hates, but restricts action. Whenever I was subject to any adversity or physical aggressiveness my arms would go limp. My arms would lose their ability and foundation and I\u2019d be left just to take whatever abuse it was. I physically couldn\u2019t fight back. My body prohibited itself. My conscious self can\u2019t trust my body to perform. I can\u2019t trust myself.\n\nThe only qualities worth noting aren\u2019t physical, and, no matter how commendable, they all stem from my broken and misguided inhibition.\n\nI hate myself for what I am, what I can't change. It supersedes my train of thought and every decision I make.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qetif/why_im_going_to_kill_myself/", "title": "Why I'm Going to Kill Myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "981194", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1330715515, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qetif/why_im_going_to_kill_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426488.4357111, "replies_charged": false}
