He says that he\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m in that university and he is 100% correct. And this is why I feel like committing suicide.  Like I feel like all of the stuff I do in college like make friends, majoring in what I want, sports etc. is all because of him. Not saying that it\u2019s a bad thing, but I just can\u2019t live with the fact that my life is based off of what someone else did. It feel like I\u2019m not fit for what the world has to offer. Basically he\u2019s the root of what happens in the future and I don\u2019t think I can live with that. \n\nI always think about using a firearm to commit suicide because it\u2019s quicker, but I don\u2019t have a firearm. I in apartment complex and the building is tall and I think about jumping from there. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll do it, I just have thoughts of it, should I be concerned at all?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l6ctn7/i_have_thoughts_of_committing_suicide_but_not/", "title": "I have thoughts of committing suicide but not going through with them...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dcw125", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611777257, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l6ctn7/i_have_thoughts_of_committing_suicide_but_not/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428377.3021672, "replies_charged": false}
