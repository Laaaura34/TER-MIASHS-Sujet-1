It\u2019s at the point where I don\u2019t feel like I have anything or anyone, to live for. I used to say I\u2019d live for my pets at least, but now it doesn\u2019t even feel like I can anymore. I sound so stupid because I threaten it every single day to someone close and of course, I never pull through. They don\u2019t take me seriously anymore and some days I think I just can\u2019t wait to surprise them. I hope that day is soon. \n\nI\u2019m a selfish asshole, I have the means and funds to seek therapy/help and I just can\u2019t do it. I sleep for 16-20 hours on my days off, intentionally ignore my loved ones, go days without showering or brushing my teeth, and then other days I feel completely fine, and can bring myself to go to the gym, look presentable, and be social. \n\nI can\u2019t talk to anyone about this seriously, and every single day it kills me inside. So why can\u2019t I just get the courage to actually fucking do it? I don\u2019t want life! I don\u2019t want anything. I want to be dead in the ground and I want everyone to forget I ever existed. \n\nI\u2019m so tired of it all.
