I was in an unhealthy relationship with a person I love unconditionally and I was so badly hoping we could fix things. We kept talking about therapy, we really needed to work on trust and communication, neither of us ever felt heard. But the one time we went last year, I was the only one who wanted to be there and felt like I was just thrown under the bus and attacked and I just sort of sat there and didn\u2019t say much, the whole thing was a disaster. So every time we\u2019ve talked about it since, no matter how much I knew I needed to, no matter how many therapists I found and emailed, I couldn\u2019t pull the trigger on an appointment because I was so scared of feeling that way again. \n\nA couple days ago she woke me up at 8 in the morning to announce that she was leaving, movers would be here soon, and she had already taken two of the three of our four cats without letting me say goodbye. We lived together for four years, we raised those cats together, and now they\u2019re just gone. She took almost everything that I didn\u2019t bring into the relationship, almost everything we purchased together, except for a futon and the TV. She has a large trust from an inheritance that will give her money for essentials, she could have easily left me the bed we bought together a few years ago and gotten a new one, ditto on a LOT of the stuff she took. She was just packing and packing and gave me zero say in what was staying and what was going. She took things that she bought me as gifts. When I pointed out that half the dvds she was taking were mine, many from before we even met, she said I was being petty and just \u201ctrying to control the situation\u201d. She\u2019s always made all of our problems exclusively my fault, she sees every argument as a battle and thinks I\u2019m trying to \u201cwin\u201d, but all I\u2019ve ever wanted is to feel loved and understood. \n\nI\u2019ve been driving for Ubereats this year because my depression and anxiety and misanthropy has gotten so bad, I really don\u2019t think I can get and keep a job, I don\u2019t think I can handle it. Driving was the one thing I felt I could do, it was relaxing and lucrative and I never had to be anywhere at a certain time so if I was a mess and couldn\u2019t get out of bed, no worries, do it later or tomorrow. Unfortunately I lost my car last year so I\u2019ve had to use hers. We\u2019d talked about maybe splitting up a few months ago and she said she\u2019d get a new car and give me her old one if we did, but apparently that\u2019s off the table. We also said we\u2019d each take two cats. I asked her to please just take this cat too even though she took me to pick him out on my first birthday I spent with her, I don\u2019t want him. It\u2019s cruel to take his family away, he doesn\u2019t understand where everyone is and it\u2019s so sad. He\u2019d be better off without me but with everyone else. I told her I don\u2019t even know how I can make rent and she said \u201cif you\u2019re homeless e-mail me and I\u2019ll take him\u201d. \n\n\nSo now I\u2019m in an empty apartment that I hate and can\u2019t afford. The cat keeps wandering around once or twice an hour meowing sadly, wondering where his family went and I can\u2019t take it, it breaks me every single time. I\u2019ve got no mobility, no agency, no hope and no will. I\u2019ve been lucky and a couple of friends I haven\u2019t talked to in a while have have come out of the woodwork to talk to me and support me and when we\u2019re talking I feel a little better but as soon as I\u2019m alone I\u2019m back to square one. People keep asking me what I\u2019m going to do next. I tell them I don\u2019t know and they start making really sensible suggestions but I just don\u2019t care, because what I\u2019m not telling them is that I just don\u2019t have it in me. I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t be here anymore. \n\nI\u2019ve been on the edge for a few years now, dealing with regular suicidal thoughts. I didn\u2019t have health insurance for a long time and have been looking for a therapist lately but I\u2019ve been so down and outcomes have looked bad so I just haven\u2019t had the motivation to bother. I\u2019ve got so much I haven\u2019t dealt with and now it\u2019s too late. My dad is dead, the rest of my family is terrible and I haven\u2019t spoken to them in two years. I don\u2019t have any support system to speak of. Nothing makes me happy. Music used to be my biggest escape but I don\u2019t really play anymore, haven\u2019t been in a band in years and when I play alone after a few minutes it just makes me sad. I\u2019m just not interested in anything anymore. This has been going on for a long time but now that I\u2019ve had the last handful of things that I cared about, that gave me hope, torn away from me... I just can\u2019t. \n\nI can\u2019t start over from scratch empty handed. When my friends give me advice on looking for work and taking steps and moving on and I don\u2019t react positively they probably just think I\u2019m regular person sad, or maybe lazy, but in fact I\u2019m totally hopeless. I don\u2019t plan to look for a job because I don\u2019t plan to stay here. I had so much hope for this relationship, I did everything for her, took care of her when she was in a similar state, pushed through my own depression and anxiety to keep us in a home when things got bad. I did all of the chores, took care of the cats, did all the shopping, all while working full time. She got to just stay home most of the week and do whatever she wanted. I never felt appreciated for it. I\u2019ve always felt like she didn\u2019t love me like I love her, like her love was conditional. A few weeks ago I asked her if she loved me and she said \u201csometimes\u201d. That confirmed it for me, and I\u2019ve been trying to work up the nerve to talk to her about it ever since. I\u2019ve been so numb and often just stare into space and she hasn\u2019t noticed or cared. Things started getting less tense, she started being nicer, and I was going to finally talk to her soon but then she left. I guess she was just being nice because she knew she was leaving. \n\nSo yeah. Enough. I can\u2019t handle anymore of this. Too much has been thrown at me the last few years, way too much taken away, and I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t have anything. No higher education, no career path, nothing I care about and I can\u2019t suck it up enough to just push through hoping my entire life will suddenly turn around. I feel like I spent my whole life unsure of where I wanted to be, where I wanted to go, and I finally figured it out. I never wanted to be married before I met her. Even when things weren\u2019t good I loved her and I loved our cats and all our nerdy shit and I had so much hope for the future. I wanted things to get better but I never wanted to be apart from that person. In 35 years I\u2019ve never connected with anyone else that way. I know it\u2019s not healthy to have all your hopes hanging off of one person but it\u2019s not what I intended, it\u2019s just how my life worked out. And now it\u2019s all gone. \n\nSo I can\u2019t, and I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t know when. Soon. I so badly wanted to see the new Ghostbusters. Its the only thing I\u2019m looking forward to. Ghostbusters has been my favorite thing since childhood, I\u2019ve been following news of Ghostbusters 3 since 1997. Those characters are so important to me and I badly want to see where they are now and have closure on them. It was supposed to be released yesterday but the pandemic delayed it until March. I kept telling myself that no matter what happened I\u2019d just have to wait until August, just gotta see Ghostbusters and Bill and Ted and then I can be done. I can\u2019t wait until March. It hurts that I won\u2019t get to see the movie I\u2019ve been waiting almost thirty years for, the last thing my dead insides will let me feel any excitement for. \n\nI\u2019ve never attempted before because I\u2019m too scared I\u2019ll mess it up, and I don\u2019t want to wake up in a hospital. I want it to be effective. I\u2019m thinking of employing a combination of methods. Maybe next week. I don\u2019t know. I have some things to take care of. \n\nIf you made it to the end, thanks so much for reading, sorry this turned into a novel.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hpfa61/i_really_cant_do_this_anymore_i_think_ive_reached/", "title": "I really can\u2019t do this anymore.
