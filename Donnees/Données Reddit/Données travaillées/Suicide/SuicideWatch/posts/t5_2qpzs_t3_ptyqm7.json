Its been over a year since I have cried at all. I'm not even joking. A girl I was interested in chose a friend over me 1 month ago all I felt is sheer anger. I made myself stronger and won the badminton state level tournament. Is this even normal? My friends are starting to notice, ive gotten stronger physically and mentally but cant help but think how and why? Having become stronger mentally does not stop me from wanting to kill myself. Badminton is the only thing keeping me here accompanied by anger and wanting to prove her she chose the wrong man.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ptyqm7/im_so_broken_i_cant_even_cry/", "title": "I'm so broken I can't even cry.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KMS__Scharnhorst", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632413909, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ptyqm7/im_so_broken_i_cant_even_cry/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426876.3192847, "replies_charged": false}
