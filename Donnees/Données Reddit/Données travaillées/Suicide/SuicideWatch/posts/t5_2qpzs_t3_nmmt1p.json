My name is Brad, and I'm tired of being alive. \n\nLet me explain.\n\nWhen I was 8 years old my older brother molested me, and it happened repeatedly over several months.\n\nIf I had to be honest, I don't know when exactly he'd stopped. While the idea of repressing bad thoughts and memories is nothing I ever aim to do, it's possible that certain things absolutely were repressed from those times.\n\nAfter keeping it to myself for 14 years, one night, I'd gotten belligerantly drunk and tried to take my own life by way of monoxide poisoning. My plan was to trap the car I had at the time in the garage and breathe in the toxic chemicals from the exhaust as I'd fallen asleep from the alcohol trudging through my bloodstream (at least that's how easy an episode of House of Cards made it look). \n\nHaving been encumbered with chronic depression and generalized anxiety symptoms for most of my life, I'd accepted long ago that the mentally ill are prone to self-destruction, and I was no exception. I obsessed over my own death back then, and am no stranger to romanticizing scenes out of a revenge porno that streams exclusively in my head of the people I'd make feel bad after committing the act. And, hey, I didn't need thirteen reasons to rationalize my own death, all I needed was acquired helplessness and a bottle of bourbon.\n\nSo, as I'd closed the door of the two-door garage at my father's house (where I'd stayed at the time), I got out to adjust the door, which had been stuck on a piece of my bumper, when my older sister called out to me.\n\nFor backstory, my mother had died two years earlier after succumbing to malnourishment brought on by Stage-4 Breast Cancer. She'd battled her Cancer for nearly six years, and never expressed even the slightest modicum of fear toward the illness. Of all the people I've ever known in my life, she is by far the toughest. \n\nAfter her death, my father started going to a local bar and drinking heavily. Sometimes only on the weekends, sometimes every day of the week. It depended on his mood and the time of year, really. I was only 20 at the time, and the only coping mechanism I had was playing video games and watching movies at home. \n\nSkip to two years later, on my 22nd Birthday, I swirved home in my piece of shit car after calling my father and every one of his drinking buddies at his favorite bar a \"cunt\". As I was speeding down the road to get to his house, I held a cell-phone in my right hand and told a close friend of mine \"goodbye\" while they (rightfully) called me a \"petulant child\".\n\nI hung up the phone, and, somehow, time just disappears until my sister and I are sitting in the dining room of my father's home. I'm balling my eyes out wondering how she'd found me when, finally, I confessed what I'd remembered from those dark nights in my brother's bunk-bed to her.\n\nShe was the only person I ever told about it until maybe a year ago. Whenever I finished telling her what'd happened she told me that she, too, had been molested by him. When asking what we should do about it, she told me to \"shut the fuck up\".\n\nTo this day, we hardly speak.\n\nI wish I didn't ruminate on memories like these, but I'd be a liar if I told you that this night didn't pass through my thoughts at least two times a day ever since. It happened in July of 2015. \n\nSince then, I've gotten a girlfriend (by some miracle) and have realized more with age that the ADHD,  Persistent Depressive Disorder(PDD)/Dysthymia and Generalized Anxiety symptoms really do get worse over time.\n\nIn March of 2019, after the two of us not speaking for nearly a year, my father passed away. The only parent I had left in life slowly killed himself due to excessive drinking and drugging, plus refusal to monitor his health. He was just four days shy of his 58th birthday. \n\nAfter this, I'd lost my job at a warehouse and haven't been able to hold a position anywhere ever since. I know it's unfashionable to talk openly about quitting and giving up on things, but this last year, combined with the latter half of 2019 and the loss of my father.. I don't believe there is any amount of love or care that exists that can persuade me from the belief I've made for myself. \n\nSteve Harvey (of all people, right?) once said \"You can't be discouraged and grateful at the same time.\" Oddly enough, I think he is 100% correct. I am discouraged, and depression has made me ungrateful. Because I wasn't enough to my father, and that's all I wanted to be. Being enough to myself is pointless when I'm always going to be the younger brother who's bullied into keeping his mouth shut about the pain he's endured. \n\nI'll be 28 in July. While, of course, a part of me would love to see things turn around in my life, I think I've started to make peace with the idea that this world is worth leaving. I'm not religious, but if an afterlife is real (for any reason), I take some comfort in the idea that my old man and I could finally talk things out. \n\nI'm giving myself til July to figure out this whole life thing, and if the four walls of my crummy apartment and the same old temporary warehouse jobs are all I have going for me, I think crafting a makeshift Exit Bag is overdue by that point. \n\nTo anyone else feeling this way, I'm sorry. Damn. I really am. Life shouldn't be this tough on us, but (using D&D terms) some of us are born rolling with a Disadvantage at this survival thing. It's a real bitch having to accept that there is no amount of being creative, fit, educated, stupid, rich, poor, obedient, rebellious, good-looking, or fugly that can spare you from mental illness and its ability to defeat you...\n\nI just hope one of us finds the right survival tools to keep going.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nmmt1p/and_some_doors_never_stay_closed/", "title": "And Some Doors Never Stay Closed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BradThornwell", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622165781, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nmmt1p/and_some_doors_never_stay_closed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427121.2422845, "replies_charged": false}
