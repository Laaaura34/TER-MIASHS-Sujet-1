My rent is 1400 dollars for a 1 bedroom apartment in a city I hate. This is the only job I've had and I've worked here for 6 years, I'd love to leave this city but with no money at the end of the month after Bill's and rent I feel trapped here, i have no friends,  no girlfriend and all of my coworkers barely tolerate my existence, i never went to college so it's not like i could do anything substantial with my life, I feel like at this point i should just eat the buisness end of a shotgun, hope reincarnation is real and hope to try better next time", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nxzmoz/in_danger_of_losing_my_job_due_to_my_performance/", "title": "In danger of losing my job due to my performance because of my depression.
