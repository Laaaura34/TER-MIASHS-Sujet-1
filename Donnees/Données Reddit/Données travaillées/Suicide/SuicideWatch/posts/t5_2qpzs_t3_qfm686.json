But it's too much and it won't stop, I want it to stop. I want to Stuy because I want to study - in fact I love studying and learning new things - but I don't want to study for aaaaall those exams.\nWhat a waste of people's potential.\nYeah, I know I should shift my perspective on things, but it only lasts for so long...\nProbably I the instinct to survive will be stronger (as always).\nYay, I am victimizing myself of school, society, my brain (likely adhd), my parents and so on. Great - let's feel ashamed about that, shall we? Yeah. Self pity. Tasty. (sorry about the irony)\nHave a pleasant day (seriously).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfm686/exams/", "title": "Exams", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "little_xylit", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635183915, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfm686/exams/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423162.2306666, "replies_charged": false}
