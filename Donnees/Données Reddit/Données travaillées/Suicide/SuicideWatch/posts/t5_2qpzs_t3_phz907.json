A lot of people think about ending their existence a lot. Some to the point of acting on those thoughts, others who find ideation to be their default response and the place they retreat to when confronted with stressors or triggers.\n\nThose in the know, is this a thing?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/phz907/mental_health_professionals_academics_researchers/", "title": "Mental health professionals, academics, researchers.
