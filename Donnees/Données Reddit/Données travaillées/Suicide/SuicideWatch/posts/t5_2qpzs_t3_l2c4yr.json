I know I can't kill myself, but I pray for death every day. \n\nHow do I stop these thoughts? How do I find hope?\n\nEdited to add: I kinda feel like I'm going to do this anyways so why not do it now and save myself the pain. \n\nFive years and two months ago, I met with an adoption agency and told them I was too damaged to raise my children and I wanted to pick a family and transition them into it before committing suicide. I was told no one could love my children like myself and I just needed help. I got help, but still soooooo fucked up. \n\nThere isn't a day that goes by that I regret seeking help and canceling my plan to give them up for adoption.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l2c4yr/suicidal_ideation/", "title": "Suicidal ideation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ConstructionNo2780", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611276524, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l2c4yr/suicidal_ideation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427282.3133543, "replies_charged": false}
