I moved to a new city, started university (and failed horribly at it thanks to my mental health issues) and have had to loan money to survive through each month and each new bill that appears in my mailbox. I'm already dreading the day I need to start paying off that loan. Anyway, I haven't been well in a long time.\n\nI've exercised regularly for a while now, but all it seems to do is make my waist appear bigger and worsen the persistent cramps in my uterus, which makes me even more irritated than normal. So no, exercise doesn't seem to improve my mood, instead it makes it a lot worse. I go outside almost every day, and still I feel like killing myself.\n\nI've felt irritated and empty all day today. I did some yoga, went for a run, and took a shower. I took care of myself, ate well, and my mood is still awful. I also got mad at my boyfriend for trying to push me to play a console game, even though I said I didn't want to, and now he's mad at me. All I can think about right now is just grabbing a boxcutter, locking myself in the bathroom and finally pressing down hard enough on my wrist to sever a blood vessel.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qdl0xj/im_so_close_to_just_ending_it/", "title": "I'm so close to just ending it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sewerslidegirl", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634921309, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qdl0xj/im_so_close_to_just_ending_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427650.086676, "replies_charged": false}
