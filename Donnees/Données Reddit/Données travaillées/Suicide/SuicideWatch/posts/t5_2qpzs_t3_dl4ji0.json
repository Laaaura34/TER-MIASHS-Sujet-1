I made it through college by avoiding as much social contact as I could; I literally went weeks without talking to anyone, including my roommates. I had five different housemates in three years of college, and I don't think I exchanged more than a few words with any of them; most times I couldn't even bear being in the same room with them. I went to the grocery store at five in the morning to avoid crowds, and I seldom shopped anywhere that didn't have self-checkout machines.  I was and still am afraid to respond to e-mails and texts, even ones from my parents.\n\nI feel like my life is over, basically. I graduated college with a B.A. despite never talking to a single professor, including my senior thesis adviser, but I'm scared to death of having even a menial job. Interviews terrify me, and just looking for work on the Internet is enough to get my anxiety going. I started seeing a new therapist a few weeks ago, but I'm not sure it's helping. I do the things she asks me to do, or at least some of them, but the anxiety hasn't really dissipated. Each new task, each interaction - and these are simple, laughably innocuous things, like buying a drink from a convenience store, or ordering coffee at Starbucks - fills me with the same sense of dread, a feeling that makes my heart race and my stomach churn. And, though I'm being totally truthful here, I tend to minimize the extent of my anxiety in conversations with therapists and my parents. I'm deeply embarrassed by the fact that I struggle so heavily with things most people wouldn't think twice about, things that elementary school-aged kids could probably do with ease. I can't help but picture myself at 25, at 30, at 40, wasting away in my parents' house, living off a goodwill probably fostered by their suspicion (not unwarranted) that if they kick me out, I'll immediately kill myself, or at least starve to death when I can't summon up the courage to walk into a soup kitchen.\n\nReading this back, I'm not sure why I wrote it, except to vent. I'm painfully aware that there are no easy solutions to social anxiety this bad, and I don't expect people on Reddit, especially people with their own problems that no doubt match or surpass mine in terms of severity, to provide what two years of therapy and a slew of medications couldn't. Maybe someone else with social anxiety can take solace in the fact that they aren't the only person suffering in this particular way. I've noticed that most online suicide prevention resources emphasize depression at the exclusion of other, similarly debilitating mental illnesses, and I hate to think that other suicidal social phobics might feel invalid as a result. I don't have any plans to kill myself yet, but whenever I think about my future, when I think about what my life might be like two or three years down the line, I sometimes feel like suicide is my only option. It's just so hard for me to imagine existing long-term in a world where a baseline level of sociability is more or less necessary for a half-decent, self-sufficient life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dl4ji0/social_anxiety_makes_a_normal_life_seem/", "title": "Social anxiety makes a normal life seem impossible, and suicide viable", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "23965A", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1571681836, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dl4ji0/social_anxiety_makes_a_normal_life_seem/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427175.419772, "replies_charged": false}
