Everything is a blur of issues, problems, and always trying to hold on, to be strong, but I can't get my things together any longer. From subtle and silly troubles to the ones that affect me every single day; silly as my ex-boyfriend leaving me, have been suffered bullying since kindergarten, arthritis, to complicated financial issues, abusive parents, eating disorders, and a constant emptiness. \n\nMy father is marijuana, tobacco, Facebook, pornography, videogames, and alcohol abuser. He loves his drinking and his own family from Mexico City more than us, my mother and me. He has been unemployed since 2 years ago. He is not aiming for getting a new job, he says that he is depressed, and simply doesn't want to. We have been pawning or selling all our goods to maintain ourselves. The cars, properties my family had, and my very own things (like my 3DS console and computer which had been helping me to mentally survive). All those problems have been leading us to not being able to pay my private school (here in Mexico public schools are extremely dangerous and being me a middle-class person I could be kidnapped, then raped and killed). Besides, I've done lots of sacrifices to enter the school I am now, losing that would be a hard punch.\n\nFinancial issues go further, like not being able to eat most of the days, not having a transportation method, having to STEAL the goddamn light, avoiding taxes (now we are not doing it, I guees?), and a larger list that basically obligates me to get a job (an activity I can't do now due to my age until I reach 16).\n\nIf all that wasn't enough, my father hits my mother. He is such a mean and toxic person with us. He has told us we are devil trying to corrupt and breaking him down from the root (in Mexico, people tend to be very religious). He has told me that I am such a disappointment, the worst daughter he could've had ever, wished me death, and he would have aborted me if it wasn't because he is pro-life. I hate him, sometimes I fantasize about killing him, making him suffer emotional and physical pain, to make him beg mercy and pardon. (I have suspicious he's cheated on my mother, and that he raped her more than once, but I am not quite sure, although there's evidence).\n\nNonetheless, my mother is not so good either. She says such toxic comments to me, made me fall into bulimia and hits me. Always saying nasty comments about my weight, my waist (49 kg, 159 cm, I am not even fat), that no one will love me for not having a model body; she also adds that I am stupid, useless, weak, and incapable. Whenever she gets me out of my nerves, I respond her back, which ends in me getting some punches and slaps, sometimes with her high-heels, metal spoons, and belts. But the thing I hate the most is that quoting \"The only reason I want you to be successful is that I want you to get me out of this house, you are going to buy me a house in Italy where I will live happily; you owe me that, without me you are nothing\". \n\nOther not so big problems that are a pain in the ass as well but I can control by myself are the very little friends I have, the soreness from arthritis (that I can't control anymore since we ran out of money for the painkillers), my shitty ex-boyfriend dumping me for no reason, trusting issues, my emptiness and bullying.\n\nThat's it! I've summarized it all. I won't lose time into details of how much I hate my life, how big my desire of being dead, and that stuff.\n\nHonestly, I can't keep up. Every day, I wake up and tell to myself that I just need one more little effort, that I can do it! I will study to get out of this neglected country and find better quality of life. But now I don't feel like it. I feel so numb, alone, and drown in a void. \n\nI actually have a bathtub, where I plan to cut my wrists when my parents are distracted or out of the house. The only things stopping me are my best friend who is also so depressed and my dreams. I've been thinking about giving up once and for all, what does it matter at the end? I don't give a fuck about false people being sad for me, because no one will! This is the end, I wanted so bad to tell this to somebody. If you read this whole bunch of pointless words, thanks so much.\n\nNo need to reply, I already made a decision. I wish I had killed myself a year ago so I didn't have the necessity to go through this.
