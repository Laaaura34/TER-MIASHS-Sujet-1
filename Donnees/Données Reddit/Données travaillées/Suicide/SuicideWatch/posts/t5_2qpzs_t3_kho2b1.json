I would rather use a gun but can\u2019t get them easily in my country.\n\nAfter some research and reading robin williams suicide I think hanging might be easier and less brutal for third parties. Just tried putting the end  of a belt hinged between the door and frame and it seems to work.\n\nTried putting the belt around my neck and instantly started feeling sick and almost wanting to vomit. \n\nAt this point I am just sick of self harming myself. Sleeping after crying and waking up to cry. Every decision I make is just another mistake and for some reason nothing seems to go my way.\n\nI\u2019m scared about hanging because I know it is likely to fail if the belt losen in the end of if my body tries to pull up I don\u2019t know. So many things that can go wrong. Why do people treat this as a taboo and does not really help you. If you are an adult you should have the freedom to do it if you really want it. The best medical way to go out is with an overdose of morphine but of course this is impossible for the average person.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kho2b1/going_out_like_robbin_williams/", "title": "Going out like Robbin Williams", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Vozimget", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608578329, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kho2b1/going_out_like_robbin_williams/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428453.0404928, "replies_charged": false}
