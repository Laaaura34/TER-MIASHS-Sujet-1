I have nightmares or dreams about him most nights and I struggle with insomnia, anxiety, and depression. My family has been broken by it and several family members now also struggle with suicidal thoughts since his death. I am a parent to a young child and while much of the time I can't imagine myself abandoning her, there are times when my depression gets the best of me and I find myself slipping down a rabbit hole of dark, often suicidal thoughts...and this is where I am right now and it feels different this time, like this really might be the end of the line. At the risk of being locked up, I just can't bring myself to tell my spouse or my doctor. I also don't feel that telling them would make much of a difference anyway: I've tried psych medication and it doesn't seem to work. I feel so ready to give up at this point and I've started self medicating (I hide it well and nobody has noticed it yet). What do you do when life has you wanting to call it quits? A huge part of me wants to join my little brother and finally be rid of the pain that I have. I've been fantasizing about it constantly, and the more I fantasize, the more I seriously consider it. I've already decided how I would do it, overdosing on ketamine and oxycodone. The idea of finally being at peace seems to be winning over in my mind.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qae8fl/brother_died_of_suicide_considering_the_same/", "title": "Brother died of suicide, considering the same", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ploygrun", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634527162, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qae8fl/brother_died_of_suicide_considering_the_same/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635421114.8027027, "replies_charged": false}
