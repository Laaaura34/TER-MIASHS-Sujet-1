Things kind of starting to escalate now. She kept talking to him and would listen to my warnings but not do anything about them and just keep talking and talking until eventually they start wanting to hang out and she has all of these things she wants to do with him. This continues for about two weeks and it is making me so unbelievably sad and I\u2019ve been just feeling so unheard up to this point and so not listen to. and then that gets us to when she tells Me she likes him over text. Obviously I am feeling so many emotions at this point and I am not in a good place already, so I get so mad at her, this is the second time I\u2019ve ever been mad at her since the day we met. I just went off on her about how she was lying to me when she said I was the only one and how she was all just lying and I mean absolutely nothing to her and I keep just going and going until she gets to the point of tears. I didn\u2019t want to do any of that and I didn\u2019t try to it just kept happening. That night we come back to my house and talk and talk and talk and get to the point where she says she wants to have a break in the relationship, but she really would like to get back together she\u2019s never going to stop liking me, but she just need a little time to be herself. I agree and we go on. The very next day she hangs out with him, she doesn\u2019t give me any kind of time to process it doesn\u2019t give me any kind of time to prepare, I wake up and see text from her saying she\u2019s hanging out with him. This obviously made me so sad and just upset and it just made absolutely nothing better. she keeps talking to him and hanging out with him for a while now and she\u2019s still doing  it up and it\u2019s making me so sad every single damn time she does it. A little time goes by and we have another talk and she tells me she doesn\u2019t know if she likes me anymore, she tells me she doesn\u2019t know if or when we\u2019re gonna get back together, and she tells me she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s feeling about anything. She knows she likes him, she knows what she wants with him, she just doesn\u2019t like me anymore. She\u2019s constantly insisting that I\u2019m not getting replaced and that I am not just temporary, but with everything she\u2019s been doing and saying it feels like I am. she\u2019s hanging out with him instead of me, she\u2019s falling for him. We have gotten so close over the past year, we have been through so much together and we have been so damn close, and I can\u2019t help but feel so fucking betrayed by this. She told me that I was forever, that I was her forever person. She always tell me how there\u2019s no way in hell we\u2019re gonna break up, I just don\u2019t even know what to think. Then a couple of days ago she tells me everything that I was doing in the relationship that made her feel bad, she told me how she felt like I depended on her solely for everything, how I would always expect things from her and she said she felt so bad for not telling me in the relationship but she just didn\u2019t know how because she didn\u2019t want me to feel bad. If she had just told me she could\u2019ve saved our relationship, she could\u2019ve let all of this just never happened and we\u2019d be happy and fine. This person is the closest person in my life, I\u2019ve never felt more emotion for another person that I have for her. I don\u2019t even know what to think what to say or what to feel anymore, all I feel is just numb and hollow. I\u2019ve never been in a good mental place and I\u2019ve never not been suicidal. But this is just sending me over the top and I don\u2019t know where to go when I don\u2019t know what to do when I don\u2019t wanna have to deal with this guttural heartbreak. Heartbreak isn\u2019t even a way to describe it, I wouldn\u2019t want to put this on any other human being on the entire world, not even the guy she likes instead of me. Every night it\u2019s a struggle to not want to do it and every single day it\u2019s the only thing I can think about. I just . know how to cope anymore, and I don\u2019t want to", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhabse/im_fighting_the_urge_so_hard_not_to_kill_my_self/", "title": "i\u2019m fighting the urge so hard not to kill my self", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Bacon_Fucker69", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635379955, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhabse/im_fighting_the_urge_so_hard_not_to_kill_my_self/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425317.151203, "replies_charged": false}
