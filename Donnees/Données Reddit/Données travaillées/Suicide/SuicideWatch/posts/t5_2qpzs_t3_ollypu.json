I do not want to live anymore but I\u2019m too afraid to kill myself, I\u2019m weak and don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever be brave enough to do it so here we are. My mom and sister hate me. My extended family think I\u2019m a manipulative bitch because of my struggles with depression after multiple traumas. It\u2019s fine if they don\u2019t understand but god I wish I could get just a little compassion. I know I\u2019ve made mistakes, I know I\u2019m not anyone\u2019s favorite person, but it would be nice if anyone could take into consideration what I\u2019ve been through and consider forgiving me for dragging them into my dark sad world. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be cured of depression, and as long as I\u2019m sad, I will be hated and alone. This life isn\u2019t worth living, but I have no other choice because I\u2019m a coward. I just want even one person to tell me I\u2019m not alone. Thinking about my own existence makes me sick to my stomach. I would do anything to get out of my own head and just have any form of comfort. Any amount of hope. I\u2019m in so much pain.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ollypu/support/", "title": "Support", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "byeforeverr", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626457521, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ollypu/support/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423036.471556, "replies_charged": false}
