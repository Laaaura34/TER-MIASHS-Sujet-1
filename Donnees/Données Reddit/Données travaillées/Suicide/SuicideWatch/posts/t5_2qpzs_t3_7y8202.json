I know nobody can really say anything to help me, it\u2019s all on me but since I don\u2019t talk to anyone about how I feel and what I do I just needed to put it somewhere. I\u2019ll lay down now, hope for my mind to stay quiet and a better tomorrow [I know, joke\u2019s on me] with more passive than active thoughts.
