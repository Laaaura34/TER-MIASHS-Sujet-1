Fast forward im 23 and all those years have been just a break from life living like a zombie just passing the days by avoiding reality and just being on my computer all day keeping my mind busy so i dont realise how sad my life is.\n\nI kinda got used to the sad life and it didnt bother me anymore and thats even sadder, then a girl came to my life again to make me feel alive  and i fell for her so hard.. cuz you know when you are THIS lonely all your life and then someone comes and hugs you and tells you pretty things while you cuddle your way to sleep... well it hits hard. Nevermind this was all fake and its over and now im back at my previous situation only now i have even less hope for life than before with extra trauma and a bigger hole in my chest. I go out eating alone, having my coffee alone and just staring at crowds of people that make me feel even lonelier but i have to keep going out or else ill go insane inside my room. Crying comes out like a reflex during the day.. the way you get a sneeze.. im scrolling through social media and i randomly start crying and then stop again and wipe my tears like a fucking robot so nobody else in the house sees me like this. I really dont care about sex i dont miss it at all.. even when i had a girl and she was on top of me i would make her laugh instead.. I just want long lasting hugs and holding hands im in so much pain i have no motivation to get a job cuz who am i gonna spend my money with. plus i feel like its gonna take just a little push to make me lose my shit completely cuz i live in a toxic enviroment in the first place i wouldnt take another hit. I dont know why i havent commit suicide yet, one thing is i dont wanna make my family sad and second i think i dont have the guts to do it.. another reason maybe i still believe its gonna get better one day?\n\nMost nights when i go to bed the only way to comfort myself to be able to sleep is to think that its gonna end when i close my eyes, when i close my eyes im not gonna wake up again and ill be in peace.     When im on the subway waiting for the train i just stare at the  ''Danger of death'' sign and it looks so comforting and liberating. Its so scary that even when you have so much support from family members it wont do anything, you just hear their words and you have that feel that there is no saving yourself from this situation. No matter how much other people try im doomed. Sometimes i feel like god has made a bet on how fast he is gonna make me kill myself and how much i can take.\n\nI really think i could have said more but im not in the most emotional state right now cuz i know that i wouldnt be able to write this if i was crying my soul out in tears.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pmwog6/never_been_suffering_this_much_in_my_life/", "title": "never been suffering this much in my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SadAltAccXD", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631466518, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pmwog6/never_been_suffering_this_much_in_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425594.1094284, "replies_charged": false}
