I spend hours trying to fall asleep and once I finally do, I\u2019m awoken by a sudden jolt that makes it feel like my entire house is shaking and that I\u2019m about to die. I\u2019ve tried EVERYTHING. No screens before bed, breathing exercises, sleeping pills, meditations, sleep podcasts, white noise etc. I\u2019ve only gotten a few hours of sleep in the last 3 days and I\u2019m physically sick from it. I\u2019m currently having a mental breakdown because I feel like this will actually be the death of me. I was already so mentally unwell and I\u2019ve been trying to get better. I\u2019ve been having suicidal thoughts because I crave sleep so fucking much and I feel that the only time I\u2019ll be at rest is when I\u2019m dead.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p4n660/i_cant_sleep_and_im_losing_my_mind/", "title": "I can\u2019t sleep and I\u2019m losing my mind", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mworms", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629002973, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p4n660/i_cant_sleep_and_im_losing_my_mind/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426591.942212, "replies_charged": false}
