I want to be manipulated so much, only for it to become my downfall, and only for it to be the way i finally die. and then, i want everyone to forget me. it sounds so lovely, you couldn't believe it. im just gonna keep on dreaming, though. \n\nmiracles dont happen whether you like it or not.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nkpnls/little_fantasy/", "title": "little fantasy", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lookathrowaway_acc", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621948968, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nkpnls/little_fantasy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428224.6052027, "replies_charged": false}
