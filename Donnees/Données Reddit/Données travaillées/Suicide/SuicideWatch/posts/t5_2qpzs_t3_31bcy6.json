I guess I just want to express my feelings and plans to people who can relate.\nI am in the midst of a suicidal crisis and I tried to get help but apparently my life is not worth saving, medical services will only care when I am being wheeled into A+E half dead or on my way there, with blood all over me.\nI cannot bear this emotional agony anymore, its like my own soul is being burned alive. I don't want to fight anymore, I don't want a life full of disability (I am disabled by my mental illness -it rules my life) I cant deal with the voices and monsters anymore. Suicide is my only way out and I have already figured out my plan. \nIts going to be over, its all over. \n\nWriting this down has reduced me to tears -  I cant believe that I am like this again. It seems my whole life has been one of emotional agony and despair. Borderline PD has taken my life and smashed it to pieces. I welcome death, I wish my heart would stop beating.  \n\nI feel so alone, unwanted, rejected and evil.
