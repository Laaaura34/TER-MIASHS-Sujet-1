I\u2019m always depressed and never get any relief from it. I\u2019ve seen doctors, specialists, counselors, social workers, I\u2019ve been hospitalized and taken my weight in medications only for nothing to change.  So I gave up on treatment. Now I just wait for the day I die or kill myself. My parents don\u2019t care. They didn\u2019t care when I tried to kill myself before. I\u2019ve had enough of struggling. Not just with depression. With Adhd, OCD, Asperger\u2019s syndrome, insomnia all of them. Every day is a war and I\u2019ve had enough of fighting. I\u2019ve heard the words \u201cit\u2019ll get better\u201d so many times I get angry when I hear it. It\u2019s been 12 years since my struggles began and nothing I do has changed my life. I\u2019m still miserable. I\u2019m alone. Nobody gives a shit about me. I\u2019m always uncomfortable in my thoughts and my body that I don\u2019t see any reason to live when you can\u2019t even think of one.\n\nAnd before you say anything, I CANT AFFORD ANY TREATMENT.
