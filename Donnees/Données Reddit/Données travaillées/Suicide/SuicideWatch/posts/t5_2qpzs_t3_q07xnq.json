One was kind of okay but the other 2 just tried to get me off the phone. I'm seriously going crazy. I'm distressed about something that happened that I can't undo and that is tormenting me but people on crisis lines think it's not something that is worth their time to talk about. Because they don't personally think it matters. The one woman said after I said 3 sentences, \"I'm going to stop you for a minute. And just to explain this is a SUICIDE crisis line.\" I said \"I know? It was me who called you\". She made a totally incorrect assumption that the thing I started telling her about couldn't make me suicidal and tried to get me to call a warm/peer line. The thing is I actually started having suicidal feelings and thoughts, like STRONG feelings and I felt scared. I wasn't to any point at all of doing anything but I needed to talk to someone. To get it out. But that never happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes with some people it's like you have to tell them what THEY want to hear, what will make THEM feel better. They love to hear if you're going to do self care. Or mindfulness. But what if Im just going to sit on the floor and hug my knees and rock and cry  and imagine killing myself? They don't want to hear about that. So once again I will suffer even more all night and however long this lasts. It's horrible to feel with all your soul that you don't want to be here, while not planning to actually kill yourself. (There's a reason I can't and there's someone that depends on me). The thing that happened today I literally cannot cope with it. My brain and heart refuses. So I'm stuck in this completely awful reality. But must not tell crisis line workers so they can have an easier night.\n\nEdit: But want to say that I still feel worried that if I can't find a place to talk to I will just give up. And consider really doing it. From the pain + nobody caring. And I'm sure people here probably care but it would be nice if people supposedly trained to deal with a crisis situation actually cared.
