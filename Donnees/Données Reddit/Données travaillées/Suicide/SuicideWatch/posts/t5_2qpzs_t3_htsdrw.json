Had a relapse/crisis for the first time in about a decade. Support system had a friend who I felt was leaning on more than was reasonable. Before we could figure out what was good ground, I went into crisis, magnified the imperfections of the friendship. I sent her texts and tried calling asking for help before I found another friend (who is now in my more detailed and reasonable support system) who helped and drove me to a crisis center where I went under observation for about 3 days.\n\nMy other friend, we haven't talked since I got out. I texted her I got out, and found out from my mother she tried looking for me after I had been admitted. I thanked her for it. She replied very short, but I haven't heard from her since. She did mention she was going through something. This has been about a month already when we used to talk all the time.\n\nI'm awful with this stuff. How do I navigate this? What should I reconcile with my friends?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/htsdrw/my_friends_after_a_recent_suicide_attempt/", "title": "My friends after a recent suicide attempt (Relapse/Crisis)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "HelloD1", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595122815, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/htsdrw/my_friends_after_a_recent_suicide_attempt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426153.8167474, "replies_charged": false}
