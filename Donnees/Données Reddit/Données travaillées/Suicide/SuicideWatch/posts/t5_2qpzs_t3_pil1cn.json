I am concerned that he will write maudlin posts on public blogs or facebook pages that anyone could find upon typing his or my name in a search bar.\n\nHe has spent my entire life ignoring my boundaries and disregarding my dignity/privacy. When I was sexually assaulted as a teenager, he wrote about it on his blog in addition to describing in detail some mental health issues I had struggled with before and after.  He feels entitled to candidly discuss private elements of my life to anyone who will listen and it has been humiliating for as long as I can remember (I have vivid memories of him talking loudly on the phone to family members and friends about personal, vulnerable details of my life as though he were not in the adjacent room, as though I somehow couldn't hear him). \n\nIs there any legal way to prevent him from sharing information about me post-mortem? \n\nI am aware that a potential solution is \"don't kill yourself \".  This is not what I am looking for and is not a helpful answer.  \n\nThank you", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pil1cn/any_legal_way_to_prevent_father_from_writing/", "title": "Any legal way to prevent father from writing about me publicly if I kill myself?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BuffSlamchest", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630874882, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pil1cn/any_legal_way_to_prevent_father_from_writing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427824.3036866, "replies_charged": false}
