I got the last of my benzos and some alcohol and drove off to some random parking lot, telling my parents that I was going to a friend\u2019s house. Had a DE razor blade on me too. Plan was to OD and slit my wrists for good measure, but it was too cold outside to do it out there. I couldn\u2019t risk being caught fucked up in my car for fear of another DUI. And I didn\u2019t want to make a bloody mess out of my car which is under my father\u2019s name. In the end I just went home  I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll just get a fucking hotel room and do it there instead.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qflspf/almost_did_it_last_night/", "title": "Almost did it last night.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Gurenno_yumiya", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635182866, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qflspf/almost_did_it_last_night/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427965.3291786, "replies_charged": false}
