I\u2019m so scared because there are so many responsibilities at hand. I\u2019m so scared about making enough money to support myself. And I kept thinking about this ever since I got in an argument with my mom over dinner about internships next year. My brother says I should be happy to have an internship in something I like (writing), but I took an internship this summer and had such a bad experience that I\u2019m scared that my whole life will be like that. I\u2019m so scared that like the internship I won\u2019t have any time to myself, I\u2019ll be depressed and frustrated, trapped in a job that I hate with a boss who is hard on me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, in a way I\u2019m glad I took the internship this summer, but it made me realize that I don\u2019t want to live my life feeling the way I did at that internship. But I\u2019m scared that once money comes into play, I won\u2019t have a choice. \n\nAnd this night made me wonder why I was born. Why the fuck was I adopted? Why am I laying in this bed right now, typing this? Why am I alive? I don\u2019t deserve to be because I am just another face out of a billion. \n\nI know this sounds dramatic and childish, but I am so scared to move on with my life and I wish I could just stop time and live in the past where I was happy and didn\u2019t have to worry about being an adult.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q1oh6x/ive_never_been_suicidal_but_right_now_im_having/", "title": "I\u2019ve never been suicidal, but right now I\u2019m having an existential crisis", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Low_PygmyPuff", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633412859, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q1oh6x/ive_never_been_suicidal_but_right_now_im_having/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426131.2919493, "replies_charged": false}
