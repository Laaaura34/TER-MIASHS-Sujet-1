I would like to remain anonymous (basically no questions on who I am, where I live, etc). I also would appreciate a downvote so that I do not gain any karma. \n\nI've planned to kill myself for two years now. I just wanted to finish high school and did so yesterday. We had a farewell dance at my school and it was a lot of fun. My three best friends were there, and so was my ex dating my friend's ex -\\_- what a lovely combination\n\nI'm 19 now and was diagnosed (formally) with OCD when I was 15. I've attempted suicide three times before; attempted to cut an artery in my left arm, asphyxiation by plastic bag, and finally cut my jugular with a broken pencil sharpener.  I also used to self-mutilate to try and get my mind off of things  \nI can't go through with killing myself. I don't want to hurt my friends and family. But I just really don't wanna go on with all this living shit. I'm on a lot of meds and go to therapy, but it doesn't seem to help. I'm generally a happy person and enjoy my day-to-day life for the most part. I've got a lot going for me. So why am I upset? No idea \\*thumbs up\\*\n\nI really love my friends. I love them so much. I can't leave them behind to mourn for *my own personal problems.* I even held the means to my suicide; a type of seed that forms cyanide when in contact with stomach acid. I learnt that from gardening which I also LOVE! \n\nyeah...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q8qm2l/i_was_supposed_to_die_today/", "title": "I was supposed to die today", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "theviolenceof", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634311093, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q8qm2l/i_was_supposed_to_die_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426751.077461, "replies_charged": false}
