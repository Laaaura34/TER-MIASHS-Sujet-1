I've spent this entire weekend trying to enjoy my last days before exams, but I just can't relax knowing I have to ace all of them or fail miserably. I can't even gather up the will to study I'm so anxious. It's so pathetic.\n\nI just know I won't make it, too. I think and hope that knowing my final grades are shit will finally push me over the edge. I want to gather the courage to take myself out already. All I do is cause my family stress and anguish. They'd probably fucking celebrate if I died, and rightfully so. I just need to find a painless method - I don't have any rope or anything to hang it from, either, for example.\n\nI hope that someday I can finally work the courage to face death like a man (yes, a MAN, because I'll never be a woman despite what my last little hopeful piece of thought says).\n\nI don't deserve to be alive. I don't deserve to be here. I don't deserve to have a family. I don't deserve a home. I don't deserve pity. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve anything good I have - all I deserve is a swift death, and to be put down like the sick dog I am already.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pn0946/repost_from_rdepression_exams_are_coming_up_and/", "title": "[repost from r/depression] Exams are coming up and I'm not sure I can make it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DatGuyAron", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631477874, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pn0946/repost_from_rdepression_exams_are_coming_up_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422909.5819094, "replies_charged": false}
