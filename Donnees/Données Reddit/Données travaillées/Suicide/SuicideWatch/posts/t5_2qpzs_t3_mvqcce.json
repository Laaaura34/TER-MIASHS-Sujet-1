The tears, the loneliness, the mental breakdowns and physical pain have become my norm. I sought help in the past year by regularly visiting a psychiatrist. For a few weeks, it felt good and life was in technicolor. Then it got dark again. The darkness has completely enveloped me. I\u2019ve always been different. I\u2019m adopted and never fitted in my adoptive family. I\u2019m an artist so perpetually poor. My brain is wired so differently so much so that I scare \u2018out of the box\u2019 thinkers. According to \u2018New Age\u2019 folks, I have a repelling aura that can trigger people just by me breathing. And I lost at the pretty gene lottery - I look hideous. I have no friends. Actually, that\u2019s a part-lie. I have several acquaintances that hover around me for favors and freebies [I used to work at music concerts] but they magically disappear when I ask for help. I got retrenched from a job that I had for almost 8 years. And they let me go in the middle of a pandemic with half a paycheck and \u2018good luck with finding a job\u2019. The final cloud of doom arrived today. I had a mental breakdown in public while at the grocery store. I watched people talk to their partners/lovers/kids and I realized that I\u2019ll never have a life like that. I won\u2019t be a parent. I won\u2019t be successful. I won\u2019t be in a relationship. I won\u2019t amount to much. No matter how much I try, I won\u2019t be of any value. I will always be broken. My physical body is overweight and gross but my shadow and soul is shattered. I can\u2019t pick up these broken soulless shards over and over again.\nI\u2019m very much done with this world and I\u2019d like to end my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mvqcce/my_shadow_soul_is_broken/", "title": "My shadow & soul is broken", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hendrixwasgawd", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619041764, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mvqcce/my_shadow_soul_is_broken/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425191.9839802, "replies_charged": false}
