I no longer think about taking my own life, or even trying to do so just for the hospitalization (which was nice experience when I did it once). My life is currently pretty shit, but I have accepted that and I hope it soon will change (have to do some final exams to get out of one of the worst high schools there). I don't know what exactly caused this - maybe it's because I have accepted that life is unfair, or because I am no longer nihillistic, or it's because I realized that I am the one who is responsible for my own life, or maybe the meds finally kicked in, I don't know. But I feel like I am out, no longer parasuicidal.
