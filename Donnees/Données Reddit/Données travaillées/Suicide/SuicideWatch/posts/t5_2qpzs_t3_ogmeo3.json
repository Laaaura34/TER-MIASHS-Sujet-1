I cant even pull anyone. boys or girls. especially when i like cis guys more. i sometimes get the urge to just throw everything i had away, style my hair kind of girlie, and put on modern clothes girls wear today and try to get male attention, because i genuinely feel so lonely and touched starved that as long as someone finds me attractive, i am completely okay. I know that i was meant to be a male, i\u2019ve socially transitioned for the most part that i can\u2019t just \u201cgo back\u201d i know i truly shouldn\u2019t go back becayse i\u2019d be living that lie again, but i also feel like i shouldve stayed a girl. I want to run away to where no one knows me and just do that. but i\u2019m still under 18. it\u2019s so unfair. i never asked for this. i could\u2019ve stayed normal. but if i transition fully i\u2019m stuck never feeling enough like a male, and if i detransition, i know what really is happening inside. \n\ni haven\u2019t had a breakdown this bad over it. i\u2019ll typically ruminate about it rarely but this is really bad. im so jealous of both my cis female and male friends, becayse i feel like i\u2019ve been robbed from living a life like either of them. i honestly want to kill myself but i know i can\u2019t do that either. i wish. i wasnt me. i\u2019d switch bodies with anyone right at this moment.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ogmeo3/i_dont_want_to_be_trans_anymore/", "title": "i don\u2019t want to be trans anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bodtabs", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625798563, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ogmeo3/i_dont_want_to_be_trans_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428027.179753, "replies_charged": false}
