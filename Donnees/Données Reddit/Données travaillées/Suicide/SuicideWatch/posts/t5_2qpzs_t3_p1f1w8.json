I\u2019ve shown them my self harm marks and told them how I\u2019ve starved fifteen pounds off my already skinny body in a matter of weeks. They don\u2019t care. They help me. They give me permission. My friends lightly brush off my worsening drug abuse. I\u2019m spiraling. I\u2019m becoming more impulsive. It\u2019s only a matter of time before I pop too many pills or I jump in front of a car. I want someone to care. I want someone to cry for me. I\u2019m so tired. I wish this world was gentle. I want someone to hold me gently, and to help me eat, to tell me I never deserved any of it and to tell me I deserve to be loved. I hate this world. I wish it was gentle. I need someone to need me to live.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p1f1w8/i_want_someone_to_mourn_my_death/", "title": "I want someone to mourn my death", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "youknowi_mnogood", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628558353, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p1f1w8/i_want_someone_to_mourn_my_death/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426715.647744, "replies_charged": false}
