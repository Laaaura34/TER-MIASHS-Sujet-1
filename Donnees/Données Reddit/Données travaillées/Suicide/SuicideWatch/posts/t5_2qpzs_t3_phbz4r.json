Umm, if you couldn't guess by the username title, this is a throwaway. \n\nI guess this is just going to be me venting, really. I don't expect responses, nor do I expect help. I think...I think I'm beyond that point.\n\nI'm gonna go through with this, hear in a couple of hours. It's going to be the culmination of some things I've come to realize about me, and my life. I know that this is the sensible and rational thing to do. I am in my right mind when I say these things. Best to cut myself out while I still can, than still continue to poison the world. And hey, at least I'd be able to give back at least a little bit. \n\nI've dug myself way too deep into a financial pit I cannot conceivably crawl out of. It's all entirely my fault as well. There's nothing I can do at this point. \n\nI will never amount to anything. I'll never give anyone any reason to be proud of me. I'll never be able to make anyone in my life's heart swell with joy whenever they see me. All I do is make everything worse. I am cursed. I know this. It is true. I wish it were not so, but reality is often disappointing. \n\nI am a useless, worthless, idiotic, wretched, boring, disgusting, despicable scoundrel, devastatingly unfit to be alive. I deserved an abortion. I was not meant to be born. I was not meant to be alive. I shouldn't be alive. I am weak, pitiful, and worthy of a knife in the chest, and a bullet in the head. I deserve to be killed. By my own hands, or someone else's. And while I imagine my friends and family may mourn for a little while, in due time, they will realize how much their lives have improved without me here. I encourage them to move on. \n\nMy family, my friends...all would be better off if I were no longer here. My continued existence has only been proof that I am unworthy of love, affection, kindness, compassion, respect, and dignity. All I have done is take. All I have done is disappoint. All I have done is hurt. All I have done is destroy. All I have done is...well, nothing good. I only regret that I cannot make them forget the memory that is me. \n\nThat, and I could not be amongst Nature more, and read more good books.\n\nI am a leech, a parasite, a virus. I must be purged. If I had the guts, I'd immolate myself. Too bad I do not have even a meagre sum of money to buy a jerry can and some gasoline. \n\nNothing of value will be lost. Some half-assed poetry? An unfinished book? That's all I'd leave behind. I'm no great personality, someone who added to the world. Who made greatness. Who embodied it. I am lower than the ants that are trampled upon. I am nothing. \n\n\nI am going to ride my bike out into the woods. Deep into the woods. Where none may find me. I will bring a knife with me. And I will give myself back to the Earth. My blood and flesh will nourish the plants and animals, and upon my head, a timid rose may bloom. A knife for two reasons: too poor to buy a gun and ammo, and I deserve how horrific that pain will be. If the knife does not kill me, then starvation, the elements, and dehydration will.\n\nI will write a note. Explain everything. Tell everyone that I know what this entails, and what I am doing. I will tell them to not look for me. To move on, and live their lives. Love their lives. Celebrate my death. For now it is a new chapter. A better one. And I will tell them to not mourn. To not feel sadness. To not cry over my loss. It is a blessing. It will be ok. Do not be sad that I have gone away. Be happy.\n\nAnyway, take care, all who may read this.
