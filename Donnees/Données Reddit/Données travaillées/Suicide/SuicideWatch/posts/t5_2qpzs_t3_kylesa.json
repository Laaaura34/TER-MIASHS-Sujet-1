I can just lie there in the dark waiting to lose consciousness. But then the night passes way too fast and I'm awake again, uncomfortably aware of the time passing by, dreading the moment that I'll have to get out of bed and get on with another day. Another day where any futile hopes of productivity are buried immediately, where I struggle to keep up with the relentless continuum of chores that my life has become. Everything is a chore now as barely anything is enjoyable any more. I'm losing the will to care.\n\nThe banality is killing me. I just want it to end. I want something to change but I suspect that nothing will. As far as I can see, the future will contain nothing but more monotony, more struggle, more mind-numbing boredom and mundanity. I hate living. I know that it is in my power to end this, but as of yet I can't bring myself to, most likely because of some idiotic primal optimism and/or fear.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kylesa/i_just_want_it_to_stop/", "title": "I just want it to stop.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Mercurial_Rhombus", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610812782, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kylesa/i_just_want_it_to_stop/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427081.2200432, "replies_charged": false}
