Here goes the story of my suicidal attempt \n\nDuring my childhood, I used to be physically abused by my mother because of my grade. My mom will beat me up whenever I get less than 80. When I was in high school, i isolated myself from everyone else and focus on my study. It's not that everyone around me is mean to me, they are nice, I just don't feel like open up to anyone. But after high school, I start to be more socialize and it went great (I still very shy though). Surprisingly, up until high school, I didn't felt suicide at all, despite terrible childhood and without any friend. \n\nI had a passion of becoming an artist or writer since I was little, but my mom told me that becoming an artist or writer doesn't give me income and dismiss my dream. So I studied engineering course during my university (doctor was my first choice for university but I didn't get it). It was not my ideal course but I still do pretty well. I managed to become the top student in the course. However, when it comes to the third year of my university, there is one subject that become my nemesis. I didn't perform well in this subject compared to my other subjects and this subject will impact a lot on my cgpa. This make me felt really depressed to the point where I felt suicidal for the first time. The thought of me being a complete loser drove me to the balcony to end my life, but at the end I didn't have the gut to do it.\n\nI soon felt better and bounce back from my depression because my friends was there for me. When it was the start of my internship, I met my supervisor, which was attractive (in my pov) and really nice to me. I had a little crush on him because of his looks and personality. But that didn't last long since he was really busy and didn't have time to teach me some skill during my internship. I soon become depressed again, and this is the second times I feel suicidal, partly because of him, but also I fear that I won't be able to do well in my future because of the internship. This times I had tried to end my life by ingesting a bottle of pills, but I end up throwing up. I also tried to find a way to kill myself but I still didn't have the gut to do so. \n\nBecause of him, I start to sign up on dating website, in which previously I never even imagined myself dating someone else since I was too focus on my study. I tried on tinder first then grindr. I soon realized that nobody on those apps want to date. Most of them just want to have one night stand. From the beginning thought of dating someone, I soon just want to have someone in my life and go along with the idea of one night stand. In the meantime, I was offer to become a project engineer in a company. Even though it was not the same as what I had studied, I still took the job. The job was overwhelming, mostly because I have social anxiety and the job required tons of social skill. But my coworkers were nice so I was fine at that moment. Then covid-19 hit, which force me to work from home.\n\nThose period became the worst months of my life. Since I have a lot of spare time during covid-19, I started to have negative thought. I started to think about my life choices, especially regarding my job. I felt that I made a mistake to start at a job that I didn't even like solely because of the friendly environment. I started to feel suicidal again and that time, I tried to hang myself. I attempted multiple times but I failed to do so. There is one time it was really close. During that time, my vision went black, but when I woke up, I was on the floor. It turns out the belt I used was snapped and I fell to the floor. \n\nAfter quarantine, one of my boss offered me to become a programmer to help the company to design the website and perform testing on iot devices, in which I accepted since it seems like it didn't required any social skill. I started to feel better and my negative thought had slowly declined. The job was headache sometimes but still really fun, and my boss was really nice to me. Me, as a person who easily attached to someone, started to have feeling for him despite the fact that I didn't really know him that well. But lately, I started to read the news about terrible stuff that men have committed and I started to have the negative thought again. I started to question everything about myself, why am I attracted to men, why am I choose the job, why am I choose the course, and why am I even born. The self-hatred inside me grew stronger everyday. I hate the fact that I am gay, I hate the fact that I have emotions, I hate the fact that I am a terrible person, and I hate the fact that I was born in this world.\n\nJust before typing this, I tried to end my life by hanging myself again but still failed. I will try again this week and hopefully this will be the last moment of my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5d146/just_want_to_share_the_story_of_my_suicidal/", "title": "Just want to share the story of my suicidal attempt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Key_Priority_4453", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633888453, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5d146/just_want_to_share_the_story_of_my_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428552.095142, "replies_charged": false}
