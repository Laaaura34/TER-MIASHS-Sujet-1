Just nobody wants me here, i don't even know why i am alive. \n\nseriously just fuck my life, i don't want to live like this, the only thing i have to look forward to in life is turning 18 and moving out just so I can kill myself it peace.\n\ni really just don't know how to fill this void in me, i just feel so empty and numb, and if its not that its sad and anxious at school. there is no good in my life, and there never will be. people just hate me, i would hate me too. \n\nthe surreal feeling of the only reason i would ever get a job is to spend the paychecks on things to kill myself or hurt myself. i am only 15, but when i turn 16 i kinda just wanna get a job for a month just so i can buy really sharp razors or something. i don't know i just really like it the sound of it. and since i bought it its technically mine so nobody can take it from me.\n\nthat would help with the numbness, but then again that doesn't help the being unwanted part. I guess the only solution for that is death. :\\\\ its either death or hurting myself, what a pitiful existence.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pom2r4/i_just_want_someone_to_care/", "title": "i just want someone to care", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Long_Student_3206", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631694519, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pom2r4/i_just_want_someone_to_care/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423147.8782463, "replies_charged": false}
