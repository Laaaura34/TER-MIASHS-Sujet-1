I feel as though I don\u2019t have the right to have emotions. I feel like I\u2019m less than human. I\u2019ve been told many times that I\u2019m mature for my age and that\u2019s been going on since I was five. Since when should five year olds be fucking mature? Five year olds shouldn\u2019t have to put up with things to the point of them being considered mature. Despite the fact that I\u2019m still a minor, I feel as though my childhood has already ended. I hardly have any social skills and only have around 3 friends who I would sacrifice anything to keep around. If they leave, I\u2019ll have absolutely no purpose to life. I don\u2019t really get along that well with my mother\u2019s side of the family, partly due to my Nan attempting strangle me while drunk and my mother being emotionally and mentally abusive. My mother and father split up when I was 5, though I still see my dad at times, but lockdown has obviously caused an issue with this. I despise the fact that I live with my mother, though I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t live with my dad. I have three stepsisters who I don\u2019t really get along with who live with my dad, so I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not dealing with them 24/7, though what I do have to put up with is my mothers abuse. Sometimes I wish that her abuse would get to the point of causing me to have any form of physical damage just so I can prove that my mother abuses me. I can\u2019t go to anyone, take my father as an example, and say that she abuses me as I don\u2019t have anything that I can show physically as evidence. She can easily turn down what I say with the excuse of me being \u2018over dramatic\u2019 and people would believe her. She has caused me to harm myself many many times. This has occurred today. As I\u2019m still a minor, I still live with her and she can easily ground me, so she has grounded me from the play station. This likely sounds incredibly petty, though this means that I am unable to play my comfort games (minecraft, stardew valley, etc.). They are some of the only things that have kept me from killing myself in the past and I often play them to get my mind off of stuff, though that has been thrown away. She was yelling at me for forgetting to put the butter away (despite the fact that I accidentally left it out for around 15 minutes, it hardly had anything left and we have another tub of it) and began insulting me when I told her to calm down and that I\u2019m sorry. She began insulting my physical appearance by saying stuff about my weight (her doing this in the past has sent me further down the road of developing an eating disorder), my face and just my appearance in general. Everything has began to catch up with me and I can\u2019t handle it. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have emotions, so I\u2019ve been trying to hide them the best I can but this has become a challenge as I constantly feel like I want to simultaneously scream, cry, cut myself, hit myself and kill myself. I\u2019m stuck in a constant loop of suppressing my emotions in an attempt to stop having them, feeling annoyed at myself for doing so, getting annoyed that getting annoyed is basically an emotion and then wanting to die but then I realise that I\u2019m too scared to die and I then realise that fear is an emotion which them sends me into a pool of guilt, anger, self-hatred, fear and dread. I hate it all so much. I hate my body, my emotions and the fact that they both exist.
