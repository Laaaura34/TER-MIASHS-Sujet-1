Soaking up everyone else\u2019s emotions is hard. Feeling like you\u2019re too young to die is hard.\nLosing those that you\u2019ve called friends is hard. Cutting contact is hard. Being called indecisive and unable to say goodbye and move on is hard. Being ignored is hard. Being in a relationship, romantic or otherwise, is hard.\nI\u2019ve had really bad experiences in the past. One of who I thought were my closest buddies gaslighted me for years. I was always bullied and ignored. I\u2019ve recently moved to another school and things have been easier, but I\u2019m afraid to trust anyone, so I\u2019ve been pushing people away because the easier it is to convince myself that I\u2019m not their friend makes it easier when I mess up and the relationship burns down. And I\u2019ve dropped hints everywhere that I want support but nobody ever noticed. Even going to a therapist is hard because I don\u2019t trust the therapist enough to tell her anything about how I\u2019m feeling because that information invariably ends up in my parents\u2019 hand. And I don\u2019t trust my parents with a single atom in my body. Because some part of teenage me doesn\u2019t trust adults. Because I don\u2019t want anyone to worry about me, because in the end this is my burden to carry.\nSo yeah. I\u2019ve been contemplating suicide. I\u2019ve even written a draft of a letter to share with certain people I have once felt even remotely close to trusting. Ive been getting no sleep at all lately. I\u2019ve researched the afterlife to try and see what it may be like after I die. So what now?\nI guess there are two options. To do it, or not to.\nThat\u2019s all I wanted to share.
