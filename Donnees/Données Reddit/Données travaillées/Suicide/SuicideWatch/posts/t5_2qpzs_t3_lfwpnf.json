Just wondering if anybody wanted to put a sweet playlist together of some of our \"feel good\" cool songs to listen to while we're pushing away the bad-vibes and grooving to the good parts of life. \n\nHere's my top 10 jams right now (my go to power songs for when I feel like shit and life is getting the better of me):\n\n1. Superman - Sister Hazel\n\n2. I Won't Back Down - Tom Petty\n\n3. War - Low Rider **(\\*Funky Purrfection Version\\*)**\n\n4. Hold on Tight - ELO\n\n5. War of My Life - John Mayer\n\n6. Secrets - The Weeknd\n\n7. Feel Me Flow - Naughty By Nature\n\n8. Derecho de Nacimiento - Natalia Lafourcade\n\n9. Shine a Light - The C90s\n\n10. On Melancholy Hill - The Gorillaz", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lfwpnf/create_a_playlist_of_your_top_10_songs/", "title": "Create a playlist of your Top 10 songs:", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "imgonnabeatit", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612853231, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lfwpnf/create_a_playlist_of_your_top_10_songs/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427509.1303792, "replies_charged": false}
