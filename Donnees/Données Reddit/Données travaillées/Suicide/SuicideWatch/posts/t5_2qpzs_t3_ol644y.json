I had total insomnia 2 1/2 years ago caused by cbd oil and Flonase nasal spray interaction. Now I have total insomnia caused by doxy. Had it for 1 1/2 months. I get acupuncture 3 times a week which helps me from having to go up on my meds. I take 200 mg of Seroquel. Some nights are rough. I feel I\u2019m up all night and sweat profusely. Other times my rest is better and I can get lots of dream state rest. Still I think of suicide. On the other hand I\u2019m holding on. I feel like I\u2019ll be like this forever but every one says I\u2019ll get better that it just takes time. I feel my gaba receptors are damaged and will just take time to heal. I do sleep it\u2019s just my mind doesn\u2019t recognize it as sleep. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be like this forever but on the other hand part of me hopes that my body can heal and I can start feeling like I\u2019m sleeping again. My mind says I\u2019ll never heal even though I healed from total insomnia last time. I\u2019m just so scared and I stress out my family even though I don\u2019t want to. I lost my independence again and I wonder if I\u2019ll ever heal again. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nOther symptoms I had were my brain and eyes feeling like they were going to blow, parathesia and joint pain in wrists and ankles, messed up throat and trouble breathing like heavy feeling, TMJ. All these symptoms actually went away though. The trouble breathing took a month to go away. TMJ isn\u2019t that bad. I think to myself if all this was able to heal can my total insomnia go away?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ol644y/total_insomnia_from_doxycycline_makes_me_think_of/", "title": "Total insomnia from Doxycycline makes me think of suicide daily", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Catheg8", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626397080, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ol644y/total_insomnia_from_doxycycline_makes_me_think_of/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426507.5712163, "replies_charged": false}
