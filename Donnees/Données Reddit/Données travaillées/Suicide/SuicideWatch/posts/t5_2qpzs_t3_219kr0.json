Tried learning about Psychology and going into therapy sessions along with trying any medication possible. Tried educating myself to see if this inherent sadness would go away, but no, I'm still as miserable and poor as ever. Had to decline an acceptance to a great university for being too fucking poor, had to pirate most of my college books because I'm too fucking poor, had a super nice sickness which kept me from studying for some years, and it's keeping me from working. \n\nI don't get it, I tried all my life. I loved just studying and learning about this world. But I'm trapped in a place I hate and with no clear light at the end of the tunnel. There's nothing positive to look forward to. My sadness kept most people away from me and soon enough I found myself alone. I don't want to die, but I'm just tired of suffering all the time. All I want is for someone to just hold my hand and travel to a nice field, and just forget about everything and watch the clouds go by. \n\nDo talk to me if you want to just talk, would love just commiserating with someone in a similar situation. Maybe they'd understand.
