I'm 19, studying in the field I want to work in, live in a peaceful place, good relations with a couple people....  \n\n\nBut it just tastes bland. I can no longer find a positive side to anything.   \n\n\nIn early 2020, I tried to kill myself by jumping off a building. Stayed a good 10 minutes on the rooftop and made the decision to step down and get help, because I got scared of letting down my family.\n\nI started seeing a therapist all the way through 2021, and it \\*physically\\* helped. I started getting back into life, go study... but all these physical things didnt fixed whatever is happening in my brain. I also had to stop seeing her because I had to sacrifice work hours for school. a sunday at mcdonalds once per week doesnt pay anything.\n\nWhen I go outside, I look at all these people hanging out and enjoying themselves, couples holding hands and doing stuff, families celebrating... and it just feels weird. I'm too awkward to make actual friends, never went to actual parties, never drank, never had a good love relationship... and im not good enough to do/have any of that\n\nThe only think thats really keeps me on this planet is my family, simply because i'm worried of what I'll give them in return for... raising me i guess, and also that I want to complete a bucket list project. It is the only thing on that list, and as each day pass I'm thinking of also dropping that project and calling it a day.  \n\n\nI don't know what to do. I cannot tell my therapist, and also dont want to tell her, because somewhere there is progress and dont wanna break that. I dont wanna talk to my family, they will tell me to see my therapist that I can't pay. I refuse to bother people like friends, they don't need my problems in their lives. I refuse to call a suicide hotline, because I strongly believe the end result will be an ambulance and having to see a new therapist. I refused until then to publicly post what is going on in my mind, because I am desperate. I failed once, and I know that if I actually make up my mind and try again, I will not give myself a chance to turn back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease someone help me hold onto life, because I'm scared I will commit something I'll never have the chance to regret in the future", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ohvlpm/im_being_suicidal_again_and_im_scared_ill/", "title": "I'm being suicidal again and I'm scared I'll actually succeed this time", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "alittleyellowstar", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625968541, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ohvlpm/im_being_suicidal_again_and_im_scared_ill/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428202.1898715, "replies_charged": false}
