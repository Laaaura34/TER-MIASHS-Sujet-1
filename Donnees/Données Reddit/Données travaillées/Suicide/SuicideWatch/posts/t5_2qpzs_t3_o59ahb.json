She's not one of those mothers that sacrifices for her kids. Nope. Quite opposite.  Does the bare minimum and gets mad at us if we have any mental health issues. Can't even bring up my depression to her. She doesn't wanna hear it. I have no one. No friends,  no partner, no family and I am working a shit office job 2 days a week but I can barely handle that shit. It has become unbearable. My co-worker hates me too because I keep making mistakes and don't talk much due to me dissociating just to get through the day. Otherwise I will be at work crying on the bathroom floor like I used to do constantly. But in secret no one knows how bad I am. They just think I'm the shy and weird quiet girl. I am so over this shit life. I live in a hell house. I get blamed and punished for everything everyday. I have absolutely zero worth here. Dog gets treated better than me. But then again the dog also has ptsd from how much they scream and yell and shit. I was just asleep and they banged on my door and it felt like I just woke up into a nightmare.  My life is a nightmare.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o59ahb/i_wonder_if_my_mom_will_tell_the_truth_that_my/", "title": "I wonder if my mom will tell the truth that my death was by suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "FatiguedBxtch", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624320151, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o59ahb/i_wonder_if_my_mom_will_tell_the_truth_that_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428221.3289738, "replies_charged": false}
