I could have died- should have died- so many times and wasn\u2019t allowed to. Was kept alive only to be put through more abuse. \n\nNow I\u2019m out of that and on my own and the whole damn system is built to keep me in the worst possible situation until the multimillionaires finish sucking our planet dry. \n\nLiterally from every angle this world wants me dead. Best thing I could do for the environment? Die. Best way to escape capitalism? Die. Only way to permanently end the near-constant suffering from my trauma? Die.\n\nLike FUCk. \n\nI can\u2019t even begin to describe how livid I am. \n\nIt is insane that I\u2019m expected to stay alive. That it would be selfish and taboo to off myself. My existence is constant suffering and I don\u2019t see a fucking end.
