There is no \"greater purpose\" like increasing the good of the world or the universe. So it honestly confuses me why so many people choose to live this utterly meaningless life. \n\nI've attempted suicide several times and I am not at risk of suicide right now, so please don't reach out or comment with empty \"life is worth living\" information. I'm actually in therapy actively trying to find a reason or a desire to live, but haven't been successful. I feel alone in my frustration that I am stuck in this pointless life and I don't see a good reason why I wouldn't just end it. If you also think there's no point to life, and everyone dies and it's all worthless, please reach out. I'd love to just not feel alone in feeling this way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oovzvq/mourn_lifes_pointlessness_with_me_help_me_feel/", "title": "Mourn life's pointlessness with me?
