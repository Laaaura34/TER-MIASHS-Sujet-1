I grew up without a father with a younger sister (by  a year) and a mother who had the mentality of a teenager and always chose men over her children. I was raised by my grandparents most of my life. My grandfather died last year, it was rough. My mother (much better now!!) was neglectful and extremely verbally and physically\nAbusive. One time my sister cried because her toothbrush fell on our filthy floor and my mother threatened to beat her over it and then did. My sister was four at the time. \n\nI grew up in Two very Raggy and dilapidated apartments caused by our filth. My mom cleaned nothing and was lazy, we never cleaned either. We got bed bugs when I was in highschool. I\u2019ll never forget opening my back pack in history and seeing one in there. Scars you for life. I don\u2019t want to blame my mom fully because we knew that we were messy; (we as I. My sister and I), but it\u2019s the fact that we were never taught how. I was AND STILL AM so ashamed of the living conditions (they are better now). It\u2019s so embarrassing. The air was plagued with second hand smoke and not an ounce of love. I grew up poor as well. My clothes never fit. I was made fun of for wreaking of cigarrette smoke all of my school time and for clothes that never fit.\n\nI was never paid attention too (not saying this caused this btw) but I think it led to my ADHD being undiagnosed. I have super bad ADHD. It affects everything, I cannot focus or think straight, I\u2019m impulsive, indecisive and irritable. I was made fun of this as well for my hyper ness. I was never told I was loved or that same one was proud of me.. explains my low self esteem.\n\nI\u2019m the black sheep, no one acknowledges me and that\u2019s ok, it\u2019s my fault. I\u2019m stuck in this pessimistic mindset due to depression and Borderline Personality Disorder. It\u2019s a lot to explain and get into but if you have it; I\u2019m so fucking sorry, it\u2019s the worst. My emotions are EXTREME. When you\u2019re  happy, Im ecstatic, when You\u2019re  sad, I\u2019m despondent. It feels like the world is always ending, my heart always feels like it\u2019s sinking, my chest is burning. I long for attention for the existence to never fade, but once it does I\u2019m in utter rage, I\u2019m uncontrollable; uncontrollable mood swings, panic attacks, anxiety attacks, anger, impulsiveness, irritability, suidical thoughts, fear of abondonnement... this HURTS MY MIND. THIS HURTS MY\nBODY. THIS HURTS MY SOUL.\n\n\nMy family shuns next when I go to them because I have pushed them so far away when I was a teenager. I took all my anger out on my grandmother. I want to die I regret this so much. I hurt her so bad and Just can\u2019t live with it. She\u2019s so affected by it and I don\u2019t mean to sound selfish but so Am I. There is something WRONG with me. I could not control this anger I literally could not ground myself. I feel so guilty, I wish I could give my lofe for my grandfathers I don\u2019t deserve to be here. I dont. I feel as if the impact I leave in everyone is negative. I feel as if I can\u2019t overcome these hardships and that they do define me. Soem days I feel so numb I can\u2019t see, my brain feels floating. Soemtiems I wish it were that way. \n\nI have no one to talk to and don\u2019t have insurance to actually get the lrofessional help I need. I\u2019m a college student doing this all on my own, after this semester I\u2019m homeless with my dog, with no family and no friends, no love and no confidence. I don\u2019t wan to be here anymore, that\u2019s how I feel, it feels intense.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k3pvq3/never_used_reddit_before_so_i_dont_know_if_im/", "title": "Never used reddit before so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing this right kinda desperate on what to do (I am Fm(21))", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Jhamilt420", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606715251, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k3pvq3/never_used_reddit_before_so_i_dont_know_if_im/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426653.2843444, "replies_charged": false}
