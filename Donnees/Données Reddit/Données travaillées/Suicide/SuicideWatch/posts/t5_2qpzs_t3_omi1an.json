I actually just made an account to write this out. \n\nThis is a long post. I've lived a long life of trauma.  I hope someone out there can listen, no judgement. Hooray for anonymity on the internet. If even one person can read this through.. \n\nI'm not an angsty teenager. I'm 31 years old. I've been through shit that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemies. I've been fucked up and mistreated from a very early age. Some of this might seem fabricated. I promise it's not. I just can't hold it in anymore. \n\nWhen I was a child, I had an immediate family member sexually abuse me. I've never written or said those words to anyone in my life. My throat is immediately tight with anxiety. It's never been spoken about in therapy or anywhere else.\n\nWe grew up poor.. so when my mom was offered a hand-me-down dress for a school event I had, and I didn't fit in it.. she killed two birds with one stone. She got a free dress and she saved on the grocery bill.. because she barely fed me for two weeks straight so I could fit in the dress. This started my body dysmorphia (and later down the line anorexia).\n\nWhen I was 16, I was a victim of statutory rape. I met a guy at a local concert. Local bands are usually kids that live in the area. The guitarist had taken a liking to me.  He said he was 21... he ended up being 38. Had I known, I never would have done that. That was my first sexual experience ever. Statutory rape. The guy continued to do what he was doing.. you can look him up in the sexual predator database.. Christopher J Andersen I believe his last location was Delaware. To this day I can't smell Orbit Bubblemint White. Its what he was chewing on the entire time..\n\nMy family.. we never spoke about feelings. They never sent me to therapy for it. They never followed up with the police on it. WE never spoke about it. They never spoke about it WITH me or explained to me what had happened. They just let this dark cloud fester in the household. My parents fought a lot more than usual. My (two older) brothers became more dissociated with me. \n\nHolding all of the pain inside, and no healthy way to cope, I did what every other rural teenager does. I turned to drugs. A LOT OF DRUGS. Mostly cocaine... and that's when my drug use went hand in hand with anorexia. Ironically, I was a PHENOMENAL student. I was in scholars and AP classes. I was an anomaly. \n\nMy mom once found diuretic pills (water weight), and my food log. Again, instead of talking to me about it or discussing it or sending me for treatment, she instead just made my brother take me out for lunch where we sat awkwardly in silence. Yes, because one lunch will cure a deep-seated body dysmorphia.\n\nI don't have good childhood memories of my family. I can't remember there being hugs, love, or laughs. We almost never were all around the dinner table. My father worked late, and my mom wouldn't wait for him to eat dinner. I have almost zero memories of my father as I grew up. He was always working, or sleeping if he was home. A therapist once told me that's the reason I go for emotionally unavailable men - ZING.\n\nMy parents did eventually divorce, when I was around 20 years old. The rape being the catalyst of the downfall of their marriage. I hold myself accountable.\n\nThis was all growing up. \n\nFast forward to now.\n\n I have a great career in terms of finances and stability. But... I'm a police officer. The most hated profession in the world right now. Strike one.\n\nI lost a coworker after a wrestling event. He was supposed to come back with the group I went with, but I couldn't find him after the show. He died in a car accident on the way home from that event. I hold myself accountable.\n\nI lost another friend.. in the same field of work, but not a coworker. Someone I had known since I was a teenager. He had reached out saying that he wasn't doing well, and for whatever reason I didn't answer. A week later, I read in the paper that he committed suicide. I hold myself accountable \n\nI'm 31.. I'm at that age where everyone is engaged, married, or has babies. I used to be happy for them, but now I'm bitter. And that isn't who I truly am and I hate that i'm so resentful towards the happiness of others. Safe to say, I'm none of those things.  I've actually been single the last three years after leaving a alcohol fueled physically abusive relationship. I had bought a house with him, moved away. Then got the balls to leave. I had to start over financially and romantically again at 28, but it was worth it.\n\nI met a guy shortly before leaving my alcoholic ex. In fact, he was a huge reason why I got the courage to leave. We dated, went on little mini vacations together, and he became a huge part of my life.\n\nThen I found out almost a year and a half later he was married.\n\nThen the rest of the truth came out.  I realized what a sociopath he was. He claimed to have not lived with her when we met, and how he was trying to get a divorce. I also came to learn he lied about EVERYTHING down to his age (hmm repetitive?) \n\nHe is a textbook narcissist and unfortunately is still in my life today. I block his number, he calls from a different one. I don't answer, he shows up at my house. He sends me handwritten letters, stuffed animals, jewelry. He knows the guilt I feel when it comes to my two friends, so when I tell him to leave me alone he'll send me pictures of himself taking pills, crying, and threatening self harm. \n\nI KNOW he won't do it, but what if? I can't have another loss of life on my conscience. I can't tell my job because I'LL get fired because, that's just how it works with my job and domestic incidents. I can't get rid of this leech from my life no matter what I do. \n\nI've been depressed since I was pre-teenage years. I've taken antidepressants that lifted my spirits a little, but I was still empty, hurting. I'm ALWAYS alone. That doesn't change no matter how many pills you take. I literally have no family (surprise surprise we aren't close and believe me I HAVE TRIED MY DAMN HARDEST) to speak to, no friends .. whenever someone at work asks me what I'm doing for the weekend and I respond with \"nothing I have no friends\" they tell me to \"stop joking around\". But I'm not.\n\nI have three people that I speak to on a daily basis: The narcissist. My female best friend whose GF hates me despite me being straight so I'm not allowed to see, and a friend who lives in Colorado (I'm on the east coast)\n\n I can go days not uttering a word to anyone. I did therapy for a bit and stopped because every week she would ask \"did you go out with your friends?\". LIKE BITCH WHERE DO YOU WANT THESE MAGIC PEOPLE TO SHOW UP OUT OF THIN AIR FROM?! It annoyed me. She wasn't listening to me.  I have no friends to be around. No family to be around. And my coworkers.. ehhhh I don't want to be around them. \n\nBeing in your 30's truly is like being in your 20's with money. Usually.. going on vacations would lift my spirits and ground me a little bit. Planning them gave me something to look forward to and a reason to get out of bed. But having just come back from Hawaii in June and literally just getting off the plane yesterday from California.. I can tell you.. now, even my foolproof method of coping isn't doing the trick. I thought about jumping off the balcony every night in Hawaii. I found a footbridge in California that was high enough and stood there for a moment.\n\nBut something in me won't let me do it. I think about my two fur babies and I don't want them to be in a shelter. They're the only things keeping me here.\n\nBut every day I wake up and it's literally such a monotonous struggle of just getting through another day. No joy. Just pain. I have nothing to look forward to. No conversations to be had with anyone. \n\nI have access to a firearm that for my own sake, I leave at work.\n\nI don't have the fucking gonads to kill myself. But I think about it literally every god damn second of the day. I don't know what to do. I tried changing my life around but having these deep seated issues for more than half of my damn life takes a toll on me. I can't maintain connections or friendships. I burn bridges so I can avoid being abandoned or hurt. \n\nI'm always sad.\n\nI'm always hurting.\n\nI'm always alone.\n\nI always think about putting two in the back of my skull.\n\nAnd I'm such a pussy that I can't just do it and I know that I can't . I just can't keep going through life as it's been for the last 19 years. I HATE waking up in the morning. I sometimes have to look at the clock minute by minute. I hate the life that I have. Honestly.. sometimes.. I wish someone would ambush me at work and take all that fear away and just do it for me.\n\nI don't know what I'm getting at anymore.\n\nI want to die. But I'm scared of dying.\n\nI hate my life. and have for a long time.\n\nAll I've ever known is pain.\n\nAll I will continue to know is hurt.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/omi1an/31f_depression_more_than_half_my_life/", "title": "31F & depression more than half my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "idontknow4531", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626576006, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/omi1an/31f_depression_more_than_half_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422257.391716, "replies_charged": false}
