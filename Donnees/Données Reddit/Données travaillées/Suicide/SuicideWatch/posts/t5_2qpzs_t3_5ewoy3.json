I'm 21 and for as long as I can remember, I have never particularly wanted to be alive. If you asked 8 year old me if I wanted to live, and I answered honestly, I would've told you no. \n\nI have been through all of the traditional methods to try to rectify the failings of my brain chemistry. Dozens of doctors, psychiatrists, prescriptions, and a stay in the psych ward. I've run out of any faith I had in the way our medical system handles mental illness. \n\nI am (mildly) paranoid schizophrenic, (rapid cycling) bipolar, and have borderline personality disorder. These disorders make it incredibly hard to hold down a job. I have been living with my parents and serving no purpose for a couple years, due to losing my car in an accident and therefore my job. \n\nI received only several thousand dollars in compensation from that accident after eighteen months of waiting and spent all of it on garbage in three weeks, with nothing to show for it. It was enough to buy a crappy used car or even take a vacation, as I wanted to do both of those things.\n\nI feel like I know what I have to do to 'get better,' but frankly, I have no interest in doing any of it at all. It seems I would have to 'fake it until I make it' and that thought disgusts me. I know what a 'success' looks like in our society and I want literally nothing to do with the way we have framed achievements and what we consider to be valuable pursuits. I hated myself as a lying (read: bullshitting) salesman, as a meek middle manager, as a cashier, as a cook. I've only ever enjoyed one job, washing dishes, because I saw no way to do anything immoral or disagreeable. All I could do was make things more clean and make people more safe. \n\n I have never wanted children, and don't really believe in monogamy. I will never feel free to 'be who I am' because 'who I am' was stomped out of me during my upbringing. I would've probably been a much happier person if I were allowed to embrace traits like sensitivity, compassion and kindness, but my father was always an angry, conservative, stern man. He made a great effort to impart a very vague, fluid system of morals that I am to obey. He made himself into something of a god figure to me and my sibling. I feel that both my sibling and I have crafted our personalities to keep us safe from our father's rage and contempt. It was almost like if we were to act against his word, we would be sent to hell. And in many ways, I think we both still have that feeling as adults.\n\nHis father, my grandfather, killed himself two months ago. He was depressed and suicidal for a long time and the last thing my dad said to him was to go ahead and do it but not to leave him a mess. Obviously there is more nuance to this situation, but the facts remain. Both of my parents have justified this by saying that my father tried to help his father many times, and it was okay for him to die because of his advanced age and deteriorative state. I am no expert in philosophy but this reasoning does not compute in my mind. You either believe someone has a right to their life or you don't. \n\nIt is apparent to me that our lives are only considered important when we are valuable to each other. Our worth is measured by our ability to produce for each other and the State, and our ability to create and raise more children to do the same. It is because of this that the only way I am to be happily assimilated into society is if I start treating myself like capital and considering others for their transactional value and not as thoughtful humans with their own wants and needs. \n\nI feel that the only reason I stay alive is to satisfy my family. To deliver them from suffering. I have told them this a few times, not to threaten or upset them, but rather to be candid and truthful. After an argument with my father last week, he told me to pack my things, which is understandable due to my age and demeanor. I am appreciative of the support and sympathy they were able to give me for as long as they have, but I must admit that I find their desire to keep me alive rather selfish. Not that this is a bad thing, I simply find it ironic to be called selfish and a martyr so often by my father because of this. He is a toxic man and perhaps it will serve me well to get away from him but I think it may be too late for my psyche. I've spent my whole life mentally enslaved to him, the only way to repair something like that is to instill yet another delusion. \n\nHe bought me a ticket back to my hometown at the end of this month, thousands of miles away, where my sibling still lives. My mother called my sibling, who called me, crying and begging me not to 'leave them' by ending my life. They offered me a place to live for the time being. \n\nIn the last few days, we have spoken every day, and they are doing everything they can to help me get set up, find a job, etc., and I am entirely discouraged but back to pretending like I really want to do this, 'getting better' and 'being productive.' I think this is because of my Borderline Personality Disorder... I'm likely to reflect whatever energy you throw at me. But the reality of it is that I'm still entirely uninterested in any of this.\n\nI also have several thousand dollars in debt. My credit score was in the mid 400's last I checked. The offer of a living situation from my sibling is only temporary and I do not see a way to get into a better financial situation to move out, much less that and 'get healthy' at the same time. My sibling has an SO that they are obviously very happy about and I hate that I inevitably be in the way of their relationship for even a short period of time. \n\nI have no skills, no education. I have applied for over 100 jobs in my current city and had only one interview that I have had several bad dreams about, it went so poorly. \n\nI will move in with my sibling and try to get a job. I don't have any money or transportation, and I don't believe that I'll be able to hold a job down if I can even get one. I'll give it a shot, for my family, even if they don't have any discernible feelings of fondness for me, or me for them, in truth. Even though they patently don't understand, and don't want me around, but want be to become successful so that they may reap the benefits, even if those benefits are only pride. \n\nThis is my last attempt. If I haven't found a decisive and effective way to improve upon my life in a year's time I will end it, as it is my right and has long been encroaching on being too much to bear.\n\nI don't really expect replies. I just hope that if you read this maybe you can reflect on some aspects of it yourself and maybe they'll help you. I used to take solace in commiserating but I am disconnected as ever. Perhaps this is my attempt to feel that way again.
