I don\u2019t feel justified to feel the way I do, objectively I have a lot going for me. But I just don\u2019t care. I mean there are things I do care about, but I am just too indecisive or scared to try and act upon them to better my life. I don\u2019t even want a \u201cgood life\u201d I just want to live how I\u2019d prefer, which honestly is probably considered degenerately to how most people want to live. Feels like I am just waiting for life to happen to me, rather than actively living. Just been bringing the bad thoughts back but even feel stuck because I couldn\u2019t do that to my parents.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pe90yq/i_havent_felt_this_way_in_a_while/", "title": "I haven\u2019t felt this way in a while", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "browsk", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630289988, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pe90yq/i_havent_felt_this_way_in_a_while/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426615.023711, "replies_charged": false}
