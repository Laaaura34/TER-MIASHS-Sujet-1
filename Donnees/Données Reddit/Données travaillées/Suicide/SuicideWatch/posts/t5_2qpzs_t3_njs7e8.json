I tell family and friends I am ok, but there's a nagging anxiety which won't stop and regularly makes me down, out of motivation and full of fear and melancholy.\n\nNothing seems to work to stop me feeling like this. I just want to cry all the time, but can't. I am fed up.\n\nThe only thing that makes me happy is thinking of a friend killing me. I desire nothing else. Reading my favourite book, watching my favourite tv show, eating my favourite meal and sex don't fill me with the same excitement any more. The only thing that makes me feel warm and happy inside is being murdered. \n\nI want it to happen, I secretly wish a friend of mine would do it. I want to ask them to do it, but know they won't and that would cause more problems in my life from the consequences. I can't kill myself, so I am just left hoping someone does it for me.
