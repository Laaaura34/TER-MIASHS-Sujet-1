It wasn\u2019t actually that but my ex and his friends told the school that along with fake information. I don\u2019t blame them, maybe they did think they were in danger. It actually was just a suicide pact, at least at first. We were going to some guns, some beer, and some weed, hangout one last time and shoot ourselves. Eventually some people in the pact thought \u201cFuck it! If we\u2019re gonna die let\u2019s bring some others too\u201d so a list was made of hostages to bring along. I knew it was wrong but I wasn\u2019t going to make to 15 so who cares? Anyway when the police got involved we were scared shitless so we went with saying it was just a joke. We had to fake evidence that it was just an inside joke so we didn\u2019t get juvie or jail or whatever the fuck was gonna happen. I got so caught up in this web of lies that I started believing it. \u201cI would never even think about hurting myself, let alone another person?!? I\u2019m the victim here!! It\u2019s the delinquents I surrounded myself with, not me!!\u201d It actually took me until today to remember what actually happened...wtf is wrong with me? How could I forget? How did I just casually forget that I wanted to end somebody\u2019s life? In hindsight, I probably would\u2019ve had I not been caught, no matter how much I try to convince people otherwise. Ever since this happened my anxiety and depression have been crippling. I have so much trauma from all the interviews, phone calls, and searches. It feels so horrible when you\u2019re the villain. Nobody cared about my side of the story, I\u2019m just a monster. I want to die so badly. My life is a punishment. I\u2019m such a disappointment. I had so many things going for me and I fucked it all up. It doesn\u2019t get better. I\u2019m the scum of the earth and I deserve to be purged from it. I\u2019ve only gotten more suicidal and more violent. I need to be put down before I hurt someone.
