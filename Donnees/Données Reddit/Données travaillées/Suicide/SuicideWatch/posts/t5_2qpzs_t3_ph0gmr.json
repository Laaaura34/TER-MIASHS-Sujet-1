It is not my intent to force my views upon everyone, but I want to share this;\n\n\nI never understood why death is a mournful topic, why family and friends grieve over the death of an individual. It is my belief that death is greater than life itself. Every single living being on this planet is intended to die. It\u2019s a beautiful part of nature, something that keeps us all in line. Life is filled with pain, suffering, and disappointment. Of course there is some good that may come from life, but in my experience, the bad had always outweighed the good. There is no pain after death, only peace. Death is better than life. I know that can hard to understand right now, but it is my wish that one day you too will see it the way I do. A death, especially one that is chosen by the individual itself, should be celebrated, not mourned and looked down upon in a gloomy manner.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ph0gmr/a_snippet_of_my_suicide_note/", "title": "A snippet of my suicide note", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Other-Case-9060", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630654609, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ph0gmr/a_snippet_of_my_suicide_note/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426768.276114, "replies_charged": false}
