I am stuck in a verbally abusive home. I turn 18 very soon and need to get a job but I'm so depressed I can barely get out of bed and I hallucinate on a daily basis, which makes it hard. I dropped out of college because I was forced to go and my hallucinations were overwhelming there. \n\nThe only thing stopping me is the fact that my boyfriend's father took his life a few weeks ago. I know my boyfriend would take his own life too.\n\nI've been in an out of therapy for years but nothing has come of it and it feels like no one believes me. I have like one person to talk to but talking won't help my situation. I've been trying to get money from my art online but it's just not happening.\n\nI just want to sleep forever. I really wish I would have killed myself when I was 11 like I planned to", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q0ldot/suicide_feels_like_my_only_option/", "title": "Suicide feels like my only option", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Moon_Squash", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633279006, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q0ldot/suicide_feels_like_my_only_option/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635421112.1320643, "replies_charged": false}
