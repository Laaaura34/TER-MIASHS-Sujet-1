I am completely alone in the world, nobody would miss me, and I don't mean that I 'feel' completely alone, I really am. I moved to the US as an international student right before the pandemic hit, then everything moved online. I hadn't had the time to make friends, so it was years of talking to absolutely nobody. Just me alone in my apartment. Now, classes are back, and my mental health is worse than ever. Nobody talks to me, checks up on me. Not that I need that anymore. I just need death. All my family members and friends in my home country don't care about me anymore, it really is just me and this terrible brain of mine. I don't think anyone would care if I was gone, they might even take months to notice. I used to wonder why I'm such a lonely person, but I really don't have anything to offer to this world any longer. I'm an empty shell of someone who has once existed. Nothing brings me happiness anymore, I am also diagnosed with anorexia, which makes me starve for weeks and leaves me no energy to do anything that might bring any joy to my life. In summary, I am alone, because I deserve to be alone, just as I deserve to die and suffer. At least I hope there's peace after.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q3c9f7/i_am_finally_ending_it_all/", "title": "I am finally ending it all.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "yunkichi", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633622543, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q3c9f7/i_am_finally_ending_it_all/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422255.032411, "replies_charged": false}
