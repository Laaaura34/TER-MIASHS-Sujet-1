I feel so disgusting. even now I feel like I can't breathe properly because i feel like hes here\n\nand I'm trying not to give up solely on the basis of my counselors being super supportive and motivating me but jesus this is so hard\n\nI feel so broken and like damaged goods and like I'll never feel whole again\nI dont even recognize myself spiritually, mentally or physically even more\n\nI feel like every part of me has been destroyed and I'm just tired\n\nedit: format and more whining", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ekbey4/tw_rape_life_is_shitty/", "title": "tw rape. life is shitty", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "drowning2019", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1578220309, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ekbey4/tw_rape_life_is_shitty/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422938.8760386, "replies_charged": false}
