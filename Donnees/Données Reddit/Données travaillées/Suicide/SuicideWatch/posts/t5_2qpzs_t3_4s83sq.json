Ever since my mother died of breast cancer over 7 months ago i have felt both alone and isolated, with each week either feeling \"Normal\" or like i do now, alone and melancholic, always feeling that my friends don't care about me even if they invite me places or want to talk with me. I haven't been able to tell any of them of my suicidal thoughts, both due to my feeling and my own cowardice. Guess it says something about me that i feel more comfortable telling strangers my problems then my own friends, huh. I haven't told my father mostly because i dont think he would understand. I can laugh, act \"normal\", even feel happy but afterword feel like i dont deserve to laugh or be happy. Please help, I just want this to end.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4s83sq/i_feel_my_life_is_meaningless_and_no_one_will/", "title": "I feel my life is meaningless and no one will care once I'm gone.
