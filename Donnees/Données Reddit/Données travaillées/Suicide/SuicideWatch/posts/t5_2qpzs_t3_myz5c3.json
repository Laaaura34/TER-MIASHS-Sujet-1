I haven't eaten in three days because the mere idea of an ugly piece of shit like me stuffing their face on food that other meaningful people could eat is too unbearable. I started losing my hair suddenly two months ago and by the time I'm 19, I will probably look like a 50 year old pervert. I have horrible acne scarring and whenever I ask someone for help, no one cares. I relapsed on self-harming (burning on a hot lamp) but even that brings no relief since I feel like SH should be reserved for people who get something out of it and at least have something to live for. I'm decent at school but that doesn't mean shit nowadays when your parents have to have money, and you have to sacrifice enough of your life and be in the right circle in high school to get to a good college that will have degrees that are worth something.  My biggest fear is just being 20 and looking back where I am now and feeling like I should have ended it there, so I'm just waiting for a pulse of motivation that will bring me to do it now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/myz5c3/my_life_is_falling_apart_and_i_just_want_to_end_it/", "title": "My life is falling apart and I just want to end it.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pottedplant00", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619447931, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/myz5c3/my_life_is_falling_apart_and_i_just_want_to_end_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428235.1494458, "replies_charged": false}
