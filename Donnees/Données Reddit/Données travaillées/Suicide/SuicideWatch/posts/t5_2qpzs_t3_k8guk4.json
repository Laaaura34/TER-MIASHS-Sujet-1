Every day and every night I ruminate on the idea of just dying. I feel like I'll never be able to achieve happiness and that even if I do move on and get over this, it'll only get to a point where I feel like this again and go through the motions of wanting to kill myself. Im not at a crisis point, but the idea of killing myself just sits in the back of my mind 24/7. I don't know what to do.
