I can't find a therapist (I appreciate anyone who might suggest ways of finding one, but please don't post as I've most likely already tried and failed) so I'm writing here. I'm tired of being alive. I'm tired of feeling like there's no point in living and no purpose for me. Every weekday I wake up, I go to work, I hate it, I try to find another job, I get stressed and want to kms, I'm burdened by caring for my grandparents, I am angry, I am guilty. I'm so depressed. There's no point to any of this shit. Some people get to live their lives doing whatever they please because they have enough money to do so or they have someone else who supports them. I can't survive in this city anymore. This city that requires a minimum of 70k salaries to afford rent and food. I can't move away from cities either bc it's where I need to be. I don't want to feel this pain and boredom and hopelessness any longer. No one understands me. No one cares. I wish I could feel like someone cared. I wish I wasn't who I am. I wish for so many things. I hate my life. I want to die. I don't want to be alive anymore. This all just fucking sucks so much. I'm so mad at myself for being this pathetic. I want to self harm because I need to get my feelings out. Because I'm a fucking loser and I deserve it. I fucking hate everyone. I fucking hate this fucked up world that makes being alive without wealth so fucking difficult.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p0suxr/no_one_to_talk_to/", "title": "No one to talk to", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Its_Temporary_020721", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628477787, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p0suxr/no_one_to_talk_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427034.9663386, "replies_charged": false}
