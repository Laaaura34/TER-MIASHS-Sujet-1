Twenty years of age. I live in servitude of my parents who would sooner disassociate with me than see me on a life path that would make me happy.\n\nI live with a woman who, despite her being an infrequent source of frustration, is the closest thing to a friend I will ever know.\n\nAnd my other friends?...\n\nSimply put, I could take them or leave them.\n\nOver the course of the past few months my mental state has deteriorated further and further every day until this morning I think I finally snapped. As per my usual routine I woke up, put pants on and went to grace the back patio with my presence while I sucked down a paper tube full of flaky brown plant matter and poison, and went to start my day.\n\nIt was walking through the threshold of my recently purchased home that the weight of the thoughts that have been intermittently clouding my mind finally decided to stop swirling and crush me.\n\nI made a horrid realization that I probably came to conclusion with a few years ago, and have been pushing to the very darkest recesses of thought until now;\n\nWe live in a world where individual happiness can only be achieved by the person feeling it. \n\nEvery day is contemplative. \n\n\"Why is my wife happier when were not at home just being together?\"\n\n\"Why are my parents happier when they see me making more money, as opposed to doing something I would be happy doing?\"\n\n\"Why are my friends always smiling and laughing? What have they figured out that I haven't?\"\n\nI seek nothing more in this world than the validation of a single other human being. I need to know that I'm not alone, that the things that I feel are justified, that the dread that I experience isn't unique to me, that other people deal with it all the same. I need somebody by my side to act as a crutch. Just a single other human being that I can lean on when I need to, that won't fall out from under me, even in the worst moments.\n\nI found, a few months ago, after so much time in denial, that my wife of now years, my parents, who have been around for my eternity, and my friends, who seemed so genuine all that time ago, are not providing that which I feel I need to be whole.\n\nI've lived in the worst of the worst situations. I've spent my nights under overpasses and made my meals from the discarded remains of restaurant dumpsters. I've felt steel under my skin by somebody else's hand, all for the sake of the thirty dollars I carried in my wallet that night. Through all of that, and much more, I've felt no greater pain than the realization that my happiness is contingent upon others contributions to my existence, and the further realization that my happiness, the way I feel, is not only not at the frontmost of their concerns, but it is one of the furthers importances in their day to day going-on's.\n\nI've romanticized the idea of partnership to potentially unhealthy levels, wherein I feel I could return to live with nothing in my pockets and less in my stomach, so long as I had that person beside me to keep me going.\n\nI felt I found that companionship once, but over a short period, no more than a few years, has it soured and become the monotonous and tedious example of married life often remarked upon in television, typically satirical in nature.\n\nWhat was once an adventure filled with loving embraces and consistent reciprocation to ensure one another's comfort and contentedness has become a fleeting \"I Love You,\" followed by unreturned favor after unreturned favor. My life has boiled down to no more than paycheck = temporary comfort.\n\nIt wouldn't be all bad if my occupation weren't so well compensating at the cost of the work being a truly soul crushing pit of despair. I'm stuck. I can keep the family of animals and ourselves that I've built content so long as I subjugate myself to a truly abhorrent slavery.\n\nEven worse, the prospect of the life I've always wanted to live lays directly in front of me, a tunnel of light in an otherwise dark land, if you would, but the tunnel is paned by reinforced glass. I can look, but I can't touch.\n\nI fell into a copious amount of money recently. The kind of money that any other person would look at and state, \"This is it. Now I can live out my dreams. I can do anything I want.\"\n\nAnd sadly, it's no closer to my hands than the outreached limbs of a creature in a zoo. Beautiful, but unobtainable.\n\nFor it is the woman I've given every other aspect of my life for that anchors me to my world for the foreseeable future. Her aspirations and dreams are far different than my own, and without stating this to her, I have chosen to quietly let go of the future I'd seen for myself in order to take on the role I so desperately desired myself... I became her crutch. I have supported her mentally and emotionally through her trials, and in all this time, she's yet just shy of half way there... And even after her completion of study in the field she so dreamed to be a part of, she's even more years ahead of her got to keep her nose to the grindstone to make a name for herself.\n\nI've chosen to forego my dreams in order to let her live a life she so aptly dreamed of as a little girl.\n\nIt was my only hope that she be there to catch me when I fall in return.\n\nSadly, this does not seem the case, for even when I express my disdains, I'm met with hostility, with conclusions that shouldn't have been reached. My problems are made small in comparison, or so she would portray them, and I'm left to stew. Her promise is regularly \"later,\" \n\nBut it's been years\n\nAnd later has yet to come.\n\nI feel like a young boy, on Halloween, who has gathered his bounty and is ready to sit down to feast, only to have it ripped away, kept in a glass box and be told that I may look at the candy. I may smell the candy. I may hold the candy, even, but not one piece is to find my mouth.\n\nI've left myself with two options, one of which is a simple impossibility because of my own inhibitions.\n\nI can leave... I can take the massive fortune bestowed upon me through sheer luck, and I can do that which I have always dreamed... Although I would be doing it alone. I would be allowed to see the furthest reaches of our planet, behold and take in sights that only few before me have been fortunate enough to experience, and I can live the life I had set as my goal for retirement, and I can do it now, before my youth is squandered.\n\nAlthough I would be doing it alone. And I feel that my dreams would be bittersweet, because in every premonitory view I've had of this future, there was someone standing beside me in every lucid mental photograph. Someone there to share this world with me, and be companion to my exploits.\n\nAnd that person would be her... I've built such a connection, such a labor of love for this person that I couldn't let anyone else take her place. Although I did not know it when I had these grand dreams, the silhouette of an individual standing by my side would someday become her.\n\nAnd without her, the beauty becomes meaningless to me.\n\n\nMy other option, which is the one I feel I am forced to pursue, is to continue my life of monotony, at a job that makes me miserable, with overbearing family constantly on my shoulder, and a lack of support to fall back on. I will trek through my days one by one filling them with mild mind altering substances and mindless forms of media to keep myself distracted from the dread that I feel every morning when I wake. And I will continue that march until it kills me, either by natures hand or my own.\n\nFor what good is the beauty of the world if I do not have that person to share it with.\n\nIt's my hope that when my son grows old enough to dream, maybe he will do what I can not. When that time comes, the bounty will be left for him to enjoy. And his father will lean back in his chair and remember that at one point, he too had dreams.\n\nThat is to say, if his father can handle this soul shattering march for so long.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5x6yp1/reality_and_the_happiness_of_others/", "title": "Reality and The happiness of others", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JustAThrowoutAccount", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1488498981, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5x6yp1/reality_and_the_happiness_of_others/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426464.5894887, "replies_charged": false}
