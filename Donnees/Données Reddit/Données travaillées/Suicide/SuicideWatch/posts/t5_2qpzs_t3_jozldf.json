I'm constantly physically and mentally abused by my family in ways I really dont want to talk about (because I just dont wanna think about it rn) and I've been the target of severe bullying my whole life, i recently became hyper fixated on death, and for some reason decided to write a suicide note after cutting stopped making me feel better, but after writing that note I feel strangely relieved, I dont know why but i think it was nice to put my thoughts out there, I think some people on this sub could benefit from doing this too, I've been going to therapy for years to no avail but for some reason this one little thing made me feel a little better, for now at least. I also wanted to apologize for my grammar and stuff in this post, I'm really tired lol, I wish you all the best.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jozldf/hey_this_is_a_tip_i_guess/", "title": "Hey, this is a tip I guess?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "froggycafe", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 57, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604641898, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jozldf/hey_this_is_a_tip_i_guess/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428129.2837694, "replies_charged": false}
