No school dances or school clubs or any fun teenage things for me. I\u2019m going in my sophomore year and I already know it\u2019s gonna by just as shitty as last year. Nothing ever gets better really. Me and my cousin plan on taking a road trip to Casa Bonita in Denver because we\u2019re both fans of South Park in the summer after senior year, then I\u2019ll either poison myself with household items or stab myself with a machete.
