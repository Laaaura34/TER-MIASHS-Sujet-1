The best way I can describe it is like standing in front of a firing squad waiting and wanting them to pull the trigger but they never do. I don't know if anyone else can relate to that description.\n\nEDIT: Wow, I wasn't expecting so many replies. Not that I thought I was alone in thinking this way but it's comforting to know there's people in similar situations. I'll be 40 next year and I've been living with this and Borderline Personality Disorder since my teenage years. I honestly don't know how I'm still here especially since I've engaged in a lot compulsive and impulsive behaviour. But I am still here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gjujjd/passive_suicidal_ideation/", "title": "Passive Suicidal Ideation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "WingedFreak1989", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 378, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1589488701, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gjujjd/passive_suicidal_ideation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427276.2750287, "replies_charged": false}
