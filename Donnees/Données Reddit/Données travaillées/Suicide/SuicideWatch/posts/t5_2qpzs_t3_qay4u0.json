But I keep making all these mistakes that keep growing, lately I've been triggered memories from a traumatic event she went through and she's disgusted by me and I feel like a failure. I just want to fucking die so I can't stop constantly fucking up my love life.\n\nSometimes I feel so shitty I just stop being able to feel anything at all but how liberating it would be to just nose dive into some concrete from a high point, like falling into a dream where nothing weights on me anymore.\n\nI get these reoccurring thoughts occasionally but mainly when I fuck up. Sometimes I'll look up how much of a drug it takes to become lethal and how I'd like to go off into the woods and try to eat my body weight of drug and hide myself so no one could prevent the OD from killing me. \n\nI own guns but have no interest in using them to kill myself because it's not a effective method for suicide, I wish it was cause then it would make it easier to die.\n\n\nI don't think I can go on fucking up....\n\nI'm in therapy but I'm afraid to tell them or anyone else I'm getting suicidal cause they'll put me in a mental institution or on aome suicide watch where I can't even be trusted near scissors.\n\n\nI used to think suicide was so stupid and I used to believe in god and I used to be afraid of dying but it would honestly be such a relief to die and not feel shame and pain every again.\n\nLet her down one more time so I don't spend my life letting hee down hundreds of times.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qay4u0/i_feel_like_im_constantly_fucking_up_with_her_and/", "title": "I feel like I'm constantly fucking up with her and I want to not exist anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Frequent-Lettuce-294", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634597754, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qay4u0/i_feel_like_im_constantly_fucking_up_with_her_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427430.2170515, "replies_charged": false}
