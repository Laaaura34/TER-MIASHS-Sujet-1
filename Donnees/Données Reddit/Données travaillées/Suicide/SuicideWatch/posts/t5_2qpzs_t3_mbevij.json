And has anyone else here done it for enjoyment? I personally feel it\u2019s uncommon to hear but I just wanted to know, thank you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mbevij/im_cutting_myself_out_of_pure_boredom_question/", "title": "I\u2019m cutting myself out of pure boredom.
