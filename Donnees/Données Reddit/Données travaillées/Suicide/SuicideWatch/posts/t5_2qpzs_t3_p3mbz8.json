At this point I have a choice between living almost completely isolated, very little (if any) interaction with friends, etc. or just calling it quits and ending it.\n\nI think I might be able to have some kind of enjoyment while isolated like that without any friends. But I feel like most people would think it sounds horrible to live that way. But I don't think I have any other option (other than the short drop and sudden stop). Just curious to know what other people think of it or what you would do if you found yourself in a similar situation.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p3mbz8/how_low_does_your_quality_of_life_have_to_get/", "title": "How low does your quality of life have to get before you decide youre better off dead?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CuttingLosses", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628866746, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p3mbz8/how_low_does_your_quality_of_life_have_to_get/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425465.0875819, "replies_charged": false}
