I won\u2019t go into detail with specific struggles but they were related to doubts, sureness, and doubts again about my sexuality but especially my gender. I\u2019ve realized slowly that I\u2019m for some reason incredible at lying to myself. I somehow convinced myself that I was a girl, that I was bi, etc. but all of that was just that\nA lie\nI\u2019m not invalidating others but for me, myself, I can tell that it was all made up out of some bizarre desire to be different or me part of a community. This wasn\u2019t just a casual interest either. I\u2019ve made sacrifices thinking I was part of a number of different identities, and some of those sacrifices are probably permanent. I\u2019ve als received so much support from hose communities through my struggles that I feel awful that in retrospect every part of me they felt different wouldn\u2019t have held up to much challenge. But in the act of lying so profusely to myself I\u2019ve lost my own identity. I can\u2019t and will never be happy as myself anymore. In terms of school I\u2019vestarted dropping behind on assignments on every class and pay almost no attention because my internal turmoil screams louder than any teacher or student. I feel like a bland duplicitous hull, leaching from communities I want to be a part of and stealing every bit of my identity from someone else. I\u2019m finished with the pain, and finished completely. I\u2019ll probably be alive for a few weeks, maybe even a few months, but I\u2019m going to be dying sometime in that range. I\u2019m done cutting. I\u2019m done hitting myself.
