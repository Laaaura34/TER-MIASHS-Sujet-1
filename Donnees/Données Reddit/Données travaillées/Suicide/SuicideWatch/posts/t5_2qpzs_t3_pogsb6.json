I'm scared I'm gonna get punished. I want to a good student but I can't with all this homework. I've put grades and homework over my mental health SO MANY TIMES. But recently i've been talking with my best friend more and she made me realize mental health is more important. Now I'm scared of getting a letter to my parents for skipping assignments and questions. I only skip them because I can;t complete all of it without taking away too much of my free time and in result my mental health. Worst part is that because of my perfectionist idea of being the \"perfect student\" I sometimes feel guilty for playing video games when I haven't finished my assignments. \n\nIf I committed suicide, it would force teachers to acknowledge homework was my reason for suicide and this way no one else has to deal with it anymore. And my class would be saved from punishment. My only reasons to stay alive longer are stupid so it's not like it matters. And everyone will suffer less. I wouldn't mind sacrificing myself for the class if they start giving punishments.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pogsb6/i_wanna_commit_or_at_least_do_a_lethal_attempt/", "title": "I wanna commit or at least do a lethal attempt just to show teachers that they need to stop giving out so much homework it affects mental health", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ididatyupo", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631671440, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pogsb6/i_wanna_commit_or_at_least_do_a_lethal_attempt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427385.5404472, "replies_charged": false}
