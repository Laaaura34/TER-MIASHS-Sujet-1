I can't remember a time when I haven't been depressed. By some miracle I have finally pulled through university after 6 years of depression and isolation, but am so ashamed and tired I can't even bring myself to apply for any jobs. I just waste everyday doing nothing; no aspirations, no desire to socialize, no energy. Believe me, I've tried so hard for so long and I'm just burnt out.\n\nI always hear people say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Like every situation is the same and every suicidal person is being emotional over trivial issues. I've spent a lot of time thinking about how and why I got where I am, and almost all of it stems from deeply rooted mental and physical health problems with no cures. Everyone says you need to just keep trying and hang in there, that things will get better. Take some pills. Try therapy. Change your lifestyle. Nothing works.\n\nSo, what should those of us with permanent problems without other permanent solutions do? Keep trying temporary solutions? Fuck that, I'm tired of holding together this train wreck of a life. The only consolation is that I know how I'm going to end it and that I at least know I won't fuck that up.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ps6ad1/im_so_tired_of_this_rat_race/", "title": "I'm so tired of this rat race", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DoesntMatterIGuess", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 40, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632179886, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ps6ad1/im_so_tired_of_this_rat_race/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426311.4899223, "replies_charged": false}
