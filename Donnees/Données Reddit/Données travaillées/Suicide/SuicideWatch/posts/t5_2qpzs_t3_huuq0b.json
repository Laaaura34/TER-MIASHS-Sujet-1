And tbh I\u2019m already sui and depressed and really like if I don\u2019t get my manifestation then I\u2019ll just go with my original plan of ending my life senior year. But I also don\u2019t want to hold in that thought as like an ultimatum for the universe. And I also feel like that though and plan is inhibiting to my manifestation.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/huuq0b/law_of_attraction_and_spirtuality/", "title": "Law of attraction and Spirtuality", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kirstenxb", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595282227, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/huuq0b/law_of_attraction_and_spirtuality/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426422.4882925, "replies_charged": false}
