I feel useless at times like these and think about all the times I've had opportunities to do more in life that I haven't taken. I don't deserve help, some days I have the ability to be motivated and happy. Other days I get out of bed and there's no motivation. There's something wrong with me that ive never been able to understand, as time passes I believe eventually I will give in to ending my life. Don't give me the stupid seek help argument. I sought it and although during the day I can get by, during the night the thoughts come surging back and I can't stop them. I stay up till 3 every night and often think about how I'll end myself. This isn't every day but when the thoughts do come in I can't cope with them alone. I will never show anyone in my family how I look in this state because I refuse to look weak. What in the hell am I suppose to do. I have anti depressants. My parents know about my mental health but I will never go to them when I need help because it's my problem to deal with. God damn it Im 17 and already thinking about suicide often. Anyways just venting, doesn't even matter what I say this shit never ends.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qathlw/debating_with_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "Debating with suicidal thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CaptainnnK", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634583778, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qathlw/debating_with_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427345.2961385, "replies_charged": false}
