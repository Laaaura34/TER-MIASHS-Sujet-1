So i went fir a walk at night trying to put my mind away, but ofcourse it does not, i feels like my chest is pierced with a nail.\n\nAnyway it got me thinking would i sacrifice someone else to save my self,  not like killing sacrifice,  but worse, living, tormented by that I'd be it's partner... But how realistic is to do that, you'd have to find someone you'd like walking alone at dark somewhere with out witness, as if that's likely, why walk when you can use a scooter or just have a dog or friends or just stay at home, somehow subdue the unwilling recipient qnd than what... Goad is not to hit and run, but than you have to carry the body to non existing safe house and than what, reprogram the human will to love you?? Like how many psychopaths have ever succeeded to change human will, I don't know a single one So from 0.0001% Of possible it goes down to nothing. So even if I'd finally would reach that point to sacrifice some else for my sake, it's not even possible... There's no escape from the pain...\n\nI can't control this pain anymore. Sure I can still go on, but falling asleep in pain is a challenge. God i would do anything to make this loneliness go away, if only I didn't failed that one shot I had, if only I'd be given another chance to be good enough for someone. \n\nIt truly is fascinating how humble you can become given prolonged pain torture.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n2wjls/yay_more_pain/", "title": "Yay, more pain.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Serasaw", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619920083, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n2wjls/yay_more_pain/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428256.6692946, "replies_charged": false}
