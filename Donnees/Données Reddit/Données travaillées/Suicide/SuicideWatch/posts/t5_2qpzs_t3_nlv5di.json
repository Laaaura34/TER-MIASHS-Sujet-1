Thank you to all that helped!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHello im going to make this brief as i am worried and scrambling (please forgive any typos or sentences that dont make complete sense). My friend called me and gave me a very foreboding message by verbally telling me during her anxiety attach \"im so sorry. im so sorry. its already done\". When i asked her what was already done and tried to calm her down she kept repeating \"Im sorry im sorry its too late\" then hung up. That was 40 minutes ago from now ( the time currently as i see it is 20:05). I have already gone to her job and started the process of contacting the police. I have also tried reaching out to her family (no response) and she doesnt have any friends aside from the ones in my friend group. What should I do??? Are there any resources I can use to find her (she has an Iphone and is on the verizon network \\[not sure if that helps\\]).
