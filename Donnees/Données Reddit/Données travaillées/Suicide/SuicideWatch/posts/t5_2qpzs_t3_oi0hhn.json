Consider this to be my official suicide note. Better here, than in real life.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve got no reasons to live, a bleak atmosphere, a bleak future, no freedom, and no chance for a better future.  I\u2019m sick of people dismissing me and my feelings and giving me feel good compliments like \u201cyou\u2019re so intelligent\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re brilliant and could make it anywhere\u201d. I honestly don\u2019t care, my problems are unsolvable.   I\u2019m a slave of Society and it\u2019s Sheeple. I have to watch others in more privileged countries get to live their lives while I\u2019m stuck here.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to no longer by a slave of this exploitative Society (which I hope goes extinct). I can\u2019t wait to no longer suffer so privileged and rich people elsewhere can continue to live their comfortable lives.\n\n\"Waiting\" is not an option for me and I hate how everyone uses that as an excuse to dismiss my problems. I have waited enough, I need solutions NOW, not a million years in the future. Time is something I do not have.\n\nDistracting myself with acitivties or interests aren\u2019t going to help me anymore. Their just distractions that neglect my issues.  That is my least favorite suggestion.  Focusing on those things is literally one of the only reasons I\u2019ve lasted this long. Well it doesn\u2019t work anymore. These problems demand a real solution.\n\nPeople here are just as bad as the ones irl. After all they are Society since we\u2019re all members of jt whether we like it or not.\n\nSilly of me I know, to think that reaching out here on Reddit could helped me.\n\nEvery single person I\u2019ve ever met or have in my life drifts away from me or turns out to actually be an asshole.  They all just execute the scripts Society gives them no matter who they are. Everyone I\u2019ve ever met or could have potentially met falls under this category. Internet Strangers aside since I\u2019ve never really met you guys I have no idea what your personalities are like in real life.\n\nI have no support network and zero people irl I could even reach out to. Literally no soul in this World would even care if I died, and if they did, I mean that\u2019s just too bad. Where was this compassion when I was alive. Those people don\u2019t get to mourn me.\n\nIf I were to die, the World would keep going, I don\u2019t think anyone would be effected, no one would care. Even if they do, I don\u2019t think their Mental Health is my concern. If they couldn\u2019t treat me in a similar manner to how they would at their \u201cmourning\u201d of my death in life then I don\u2019t see others as a valid excuse to keep going.  If I\u2019m not valued or have any concern given to my emotions or mental health then I just frankly do not care about contributing to the World. Like I\u2019d much rather be treated like a Human by others than given shallow compliments (not referring to you, just the people I\u2019ve had in my life in general)  Nothing I ever did or could of potentially done in the future would matter since it\u2019s not like you can transfer your memories to your non-existent state.  I don\u2019t think I have a reason to live or to want to live.\n\nI  have like a million reasons to want to end my existence though\n\nSorry if I repated myself throughout the post, some of it was cut I'm not sure where it went lol but I think this is sufficient enough.\n\nTL;DR then I\"m not intereted in what you have to say.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oi0hhn/im_going_to_have_my_second_attempt_today_and_hope/", "title": "I'm going to have my second attempt today, and hope that it's sucessful and my last", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DanGaming_Reddit", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625990775, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oi0hhn/im_going_to_have_my_second_attempt_today_and_hope/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423033.5166135, "replies_charged": false}
