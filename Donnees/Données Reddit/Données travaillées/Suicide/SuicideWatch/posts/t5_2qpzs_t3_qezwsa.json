Compared to the past, where I feel sad thinking about committing suicide - thinking of what I would leave behind, I feel indifferent now. I don't care about what I would be leaving behind, because it feels like there's nothing there (even tho the opposite is true). \n\nI did a tarrot reading about whether I should kill myself or not a couple weeks ago. I don't remember the cards that I pulled but I remember pulling a card that represented difficult decisions and one that represented peace. I take it as a yes. \n\nI just can't seem to push myself go commit suicide even tho I want to.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qezwsa/i_wish_committing_suicide_was_easier/", "title": "I wish committing suicide was easier", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cosmiccowww", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635105685, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qezwsa/i_wish_committing_suicide_was_easier/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428317.0922918, "replies_charged": false}
