I realized my account is 3 months old roday and remembered the horrible feeling of being anxious as hell, devastated and feeling suicidal. Sooo... I created this account just minutes after i was dumped by my ex gf and... I needed advice because at that moment i was just left all alone with nobody to lean on before i finally told one of my closest internet friends about what i did and what happened. My first post was about what to do because i wanted to just die. I'm feeling better now from what i felt like during that time. Thank you reddit for being there for me when i needed it most. ^^ i really appreciate it that people are nice and help others. I might not be here to see summer, maybe not be here after fall,who knows i might fail the next time i do something stupid and die but... Its been alot of fun and aslong as i keep reddit on my phone and check it every few hours ill be ok. To everyone suffering with suicidal thoughts... If you ever need someone to talk to you can message me and ill try my best to answer and listen to you.
