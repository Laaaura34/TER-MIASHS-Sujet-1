I\u2019m always \u201cbehind glass\u201d no matter how close I might get to people. I just can\u2019t connect to the world no matter what I do. This is more than just socializing. I enjoy socializing on the rare occasion that I do. But I just don\u2019t feel connected enough. I\u2019m not completely there. Everyone else interacts in a way I just can\u2019t and never will be able to. This could be due to mental illness or other conditions but I\u2019ve never gotten a conclusive or comprehensive diagnosis from any mental health professional I\u2019ve seen\n\nThere is nothing I can find to solve this. I just can\u2019t keep doing this charade of a life, even if circumstances are tolerable the total lack of meaning and connection negates everything. It\u2019s like a dream I cant control even as I get older\n\nI think that what makes it worse is that the lack of it being a noticeable problem to others means it never gets addressed. I just have to pretend everything\u2019s fine. Even if someone else notices they don\u2019t care enough or don\u2019t know how to tell me. Sometimes I feel everyone knows and just won\u2019t tell me. \n\nTalking about  it with mental health professionals is a total waste of time both mine and theirs apparently. \n\nI feel compelled to suicide as just something has to be done. Not even a solution not because I\u2019m sad. Just a  compulsion to fill a need I can\u2019t fill any other way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q0a6kq/no_connection/", "title": "No connection?!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PrimaryMiserable", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633233343, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q0a6kq/no_connection/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427624.2909129, "replies_charged": false}
