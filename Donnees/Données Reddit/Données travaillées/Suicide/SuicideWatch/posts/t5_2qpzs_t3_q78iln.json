Since then, I put on weight. Every single day I try to starve myself again, but I always end up failing and overeating. It\u2019s made me hate myself so much. I feel trapped. Death is the only way out of this cycle. I know that the only way I can stay alive is if I\u2019m successful in starving myself again. It\u2019s taken over every single thought in my head. I can\u2019t focus on school. All I can focus on is how much I hate food and want to starve myself again. I need to starve myself again. Please, please. Please. I need to starve. I need to be skinny. I want to kill my self.
