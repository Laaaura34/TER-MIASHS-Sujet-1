Though the problem is he has some really fucked up background like he was abused, sexually and physically by his uncle when he was young. \n\nBut I on the other hand, I had a good upbringing. Though, I had a heart problem when I was a child the doctor told me I might not gonna make it by 21. And I revolved my whole life around this. I always thought \" I'm gonna die anyway, so why bother?\" That's why I grew up not caring on anything. I somehow accepted this fact.\n\nBut when I was 19 I had a surgrry (thanks to modern medicine) which cured me and now I'm 25, but I don't have any idea what to do since I've been accustomed to dying. And now I am motivated in anything. I have no dreams ever since I was a child. I just want to disappear.\n\nSo I made a suicide pact to the said friend. But recently he has been really really really down and he wants to do it soon. He even gave me cyanide. Because I've tried committing suicide before twice but it all failed, First I drunk about 30 tablets of paracetamol, but I was hospitalized. Next I tried hanging buty bf at the time saved me. \n\nSo this friend told me that it's a sure thing. \n\nI have a good life, I have friends who I laugh with.. I have a family who takes care and love me. But from time to time my MDD kicks in and I am drowned by anxiety. When my dad asks me what's getting me down. I can't answer him because I don't know what is.\n\nYet I still don't know if do I really want to end it all...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f33k1q/i_have_a_suicide_pact_with_a_friend_and_now_hes/", "title": "I have a suicide pact with a friend, and now he's pressuring me to do it.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sarafina99", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1581564338, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f33k1q/i_have_a_suicide_pact_with_a_friend_and_now_hes/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427696.4930553, "replies_charged": false}
