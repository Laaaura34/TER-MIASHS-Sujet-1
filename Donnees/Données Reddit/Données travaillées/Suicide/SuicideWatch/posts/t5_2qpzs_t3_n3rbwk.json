And I\u2019m only now noticing how much I hate what\u2019s been happening to my body. I have to shave every week because my facial hair disgusts me. It feels so, so wrong to be on my body. My legs are so time consuming to shave and clean that I don\u2019t even bother sometimes, but that makes it worse. I feel it and I just get so melancholy. I just wish it would come off, or that I could change myself to get rid of it all. My chest, my arms, I haven\u2019t even bothered with those. The only thing that made me really happy was finding some lipstick I could wear. I told my friend about it, I was so excited to see how I looked in the mirror. I wish I could get some actual makeup to wear. But I\u2019m broke, and I can\u2019t order anything. I wish I didn\u2019t have to hide myself. It sucks.
