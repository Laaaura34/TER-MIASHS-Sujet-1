I\u2019ve ruined my body by being fat for so long and now that I\u2019ve lost the weight my body has been ruined. My mental health is complete dog shit and I have BPD. The only reason I don\u2019t kill myself is because of my sister.\n\nNow that the pre amble is outta the way. I see a lot of people I went to high school with have died or committed suicide. In these posts about them so many people recognize them and share memories of them and they actually seem like people cared for them and will remember them. For example a kid who killed Him self when we where in 6th grade is still talked about and mourned to this day and we are in our early 20\u2019s now. \n\nMy entirelife I\u2019ve been over looked and forgotten I\u2019ve never had many friends and I don\u2019t have any now. But I feel like before I fade outta existence I want people to know I existed that I was here. One last \u201cfuck you I existed\u201d to the world. I don\u2019t have many people who would mourn me. I\u2019m jealous of other people who have many people who would remember them. It\u2019s sad that my life will eventually amount to some small cliff note in someone else\u2019s anecdotes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovmrk4/does_anyone_ever_feel_like_you_just_want_the/", "title": "Does anyone ever feel like you just want the world to know you existed after you\u2019ve gone?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PostBirthAbortion2", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627797304, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovmrk4/does_anyone_ever_feel_like_you_just_want_the/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426765.9486234, "replies_charged": false}
