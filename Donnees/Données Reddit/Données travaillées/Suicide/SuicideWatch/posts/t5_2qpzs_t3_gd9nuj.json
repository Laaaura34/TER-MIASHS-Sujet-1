I'm nearly 30 years old, I'm queer, I'm alone, & I feel as though I've wasted every second & have nothing to show for it. \n\nI've had issues with mental health for a long time, I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 10, but I've never been diagnosed. My mom doesnt really do doctors & any mention of feeling depressed or something is always met by her with something like \"I'm sorry I've failed you so badly\" or \"I'm sorry the life I gave you is so horrible\"\n\nI'm unemployed, again, and dont have any real skills or useful experience. I've worked retail for years but I've never been able to work my way up & retail experience doesnt mean anything to other industries. The only jobs I'm qualified for are bottom of the totem pole, minimum wage, cashier positions alongside all the kids half my age. Except for those kids its always just a place holder. A summer job or something to give them spending money while they get their degrees or hold them over until they get a job in their dream field. I dont have one of those. I've never found a passion or \"my thing\" and at this point I dont think I ever will. A lifetime working shit job after shit job never going anywhere & never having more to aspire to just doesnt sound worth it to me. I still live with my mother & every day I see how disappointed she is in me. I'm her only friend and even though she loves me, she doesnt like me.\n\nI have no education. I never went to college cause I couldnt afford it, my mom still resents that she had to take out loans for my brother, and I never had anything that I could pursue. I hate it so much when I try to tell people how hopeless I feel they all, without exception say \"go to school\". That isnt a fucking answer to anything. Am I supposed to go to a community college & fuck around trying to \"find myself\" like all the kids do in the hopes that what? I somehow magically discover some hidden talent & 7 years from now I have a degree & can start my life when its already half way over? And what if that never happens and I put myself into debt just wishing that I find out after all these years that I've had something to offer all along. Its bullshit.\n\nI'm almost middle aged and I've never had a license, I cant handle being behind the wheel. Something as simple as being mobile is too much for me, that's how fucked up I am. Another reason school isnt an option, how am I supposed to work & go to school while having to rely on public transport. And everytime I want to see a friend & I have to ask them to drive me around I know how much of a burden I'm being, cause unlike every other adult I just cant get around on my own.\n\nSomething I finally realized this year, and especially since quarantine happened, is that I dont have a single relationship that isnt superficial. All of my friendships are surface level, based around vague shared interests and me being a clown. But they don't need me, most dont even really know me. They just come to me every now and then when they need a laugh. It's like I've realized that for no one in my life am I essential. My best friend, the person I thought I could trust with anything who would be the most significant relationship of the rest of my life, was totally fine to go without any contact with me for 2 months. And then told me they were moving permanently to a part of our state I cant easily visit. They simply dont need me. None of my friends do. They all have other people they need & I'll never be that person.\n\nI've never been on a date. I've never had a boyfriend, or even someone who was interested in being that for me. There are plenty of guys who will hit me up for sex, but that's cause I'm easy. I'm willing to be used they way they want to use me cause I know that's the only way I can get someone to want me. I lost my virginity to someone who asks me to wear a hood so he doesnt have to look at me. I go on grindr or tinder & people laugh at me, call me a freak, call me ugly. The ones who dont call me a freak turn me into a fetish, they dont want me they want to feel dirty by fucking someone as taboo as me. I always say I dont want a relationship & that's partially true, I dont really think they work. But I also know that no one wants that with me. And I dont want to admit it but I so badly want to feel loved, I want to feel like I mean something to someone. Like I'm not worthless. When I was a little kid the only thing I wanted to be when I grew up was beautiful. And I've failed at that as well. I'm short, I'm fat, I have acne like a teenager, I have bad teeth. I'm hairy, so much so that a guy who I thought liked me ghosted me for a year cause he was to disgusted by my body to see me again. \n\nSo there it is I guess. In almost 30 years I've never accomplished a single thing. I've not built any meaningful relationships, I've not felt love, I've not made myself appealing to others. I've not been successful or ambitious or intelligent. I've been around for so long and I have nothing to show for it & I look at everyone else & see all they have accomplished for themselves & know that will never be me. I'll be stuck here living with my mom like some tragic grey gardens experience, for the rest of my sad, lonely, little life & one day I'll die and people will say they miss me but the truth is I never meant anything to them to begin with. The only person who will miss me is my mom and thats cause I'm the only friend she has. \n\nI know I'll never even succeed at ending things for myself & that's the saddest part of all. I'll never have the courage to put an end to it all and I'll just keep barely living for decades.
