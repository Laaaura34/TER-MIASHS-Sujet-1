Even though no one is going to be bothered to go through my phone and find this. I made it clear i was suffering and no one cared so I don't think they'll care when I'm gone but i just want it out there. \n\nI live in a small country. I was diagnosed with depression about 2 or 3 years ago. (To this day I don't know why this happened.) I've suffered in school keeping friends i guess i was not their type of person. I also had two friends only two they'd always bully me and make fun of me. I was doing Terrible in studies. And then one day things got worse. \n\nI begged my mom not to make me go to school she let me stay home. This went on for a couple of months. And then my father couldn't watch it. So he beat me. (Not brutally we always had that you messed up you get hit) and then he made me get ready for school i said I didn't want to and i held on to my mom. And then and there she looked away from me. I guess maybe there it broke me so hard. \n\nAfter that things kept going downhill i started getting super angry at simple things. My parents did try to help me they tried therapy, medication. Nothing helped things kept getting worse.\n\nAnd as i said 2 or 3 years ago i was diagnosed with depression for it seems like forever i battled it. Mind you i did some horrible things. When i was feeling down i stole money and got weed and alcohol. I was offered heroin, meth and cocaine in those times but i refused. Back then i really thought i could actually get better things would be okay. I just didn't wanna ruin my parents lives. So i tried to get better. And so i did everything good took medicine stopped most of alcohol and cigarettes. But things kept getting worse. \n\nOne night i started going crazy. I would randomly start crying. I just my head on the wall. So i went to my parents and i told them and all i got was well you didn't listen to us. Come sleep in my room that's all i got but i just couldn't keep up. I went for a walk came back went and told them i got the same response i went to the car i screamed at the top of my lungs. And i noticed my moms purse. So i took it and i saw money i wanted to take it i didn't. I went up told them i was feeling suicidal. I got the same response. I went to the car i took the money. I was tempted to get some crystal. But i controlled my self. I put the money in my cupboard cause i was exhausted i didn't know anything else to do. So i fell asleep and my mom woke me next morning screaming at me cause i took money i gave it back but i guess things weren't good enough. She haven't spoken to me in 3 weeks i have to mostly cook for myself. I know i fucked up. I always do I can't keep doing this to my parents\n\nSo I'm giving up. I'm done. I'm done trying to get better I'm just so fucking tried. I'm stopping medicine. I'm just gonna wait for the suicidal thoughts to catch on and end me. \n\nSo this is my suicide letter i guess.
