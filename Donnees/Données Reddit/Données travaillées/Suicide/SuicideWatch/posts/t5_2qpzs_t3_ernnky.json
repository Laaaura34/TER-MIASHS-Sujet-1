I am tired of talking to people, so I will type instead.\n\nI made a suicide attempt in December, but got stopped. I'm on antidepressants and am in therapy. I feel no better, yet. That is to be expected. Since being in this state I have spoken to hundreds of people. Therapists, other students, and people with mental illness. All conversation about suicide reinforces the value of life. This is subject to survivorship bias. Only the people who haven't cracked, those who have been to the very rock bottom, are able to say life is worth living for.\n\nWhen discussing this with others, the truth is that this condition can last a lifetime. A life, they report, of pain. Why not cut out the middle man? Why not just be done with all of this? The chance of recovery? The feelings I've been wrestling with for months now far outweigh the positives of my life. This isn't sustainable. I don't believe I can do this anymore. My one merit has been talking to people, that I made that last call before ending it.\n\nWell, what happens when I don't want to be helped anymore?\n\nAll the best,\nL", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ernnky/ruminations/", "title": "Ruminations", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Broawayman", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1579571846, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ernnky/ruminations/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427993.4992769, "replies_charged": false}
