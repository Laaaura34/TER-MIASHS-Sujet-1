Before doing anything, I decided to call the hotline (and unsurprisingly, was put on hold). I then finally answered my friend's phone calls since I never got a response from the hotline and then the police showed up. Things looked up for about a month, but now I'm slipping again. I dread going to work. I still feel incredibly jealous of how my friends have moved on with their lives, and the fact that I haven't really spoken to them since my attempt. I hate that I'm not in school because I was deemed too unstable to go. I hate who I am. It was a mistake to answer my friends that day, because I ended up back where I started.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q4fujj/everyday_i_get_more_angry_that_i_let_my_friends/", "title": "Everyday I get more angry that I let my friends intervene in my suicide attempt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "FormerlyDj_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633761761, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q4fujj/everyday_i_get_more_angry_that_i_let_my_friends/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428521.366623, "replies_charged": false}
