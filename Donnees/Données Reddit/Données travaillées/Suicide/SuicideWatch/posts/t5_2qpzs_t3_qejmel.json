I\u2019m so tired of living like this I don\u2019t think I\u2019m able to comprehend the gravity of my thoughts anymore.\n\nI\u2019ve been suicidal for years and have entirely lost touch with what life without depression feels like. I have constant suicidal thoughts and am continuously planning how I will end my life. I\u2019ve been in this state of survival for too long, all my existence has come to is finding distractions that get me through each day, hour by hour.\n\nPart of me feels like I\u2019m ready to end my life tonight, yet part of me doesn\u2019t believe that I\u2019ll ever be able to follow through with it. I feel like I\u2019ve been standing on the edge of a cliff for years, only a foot away from death. Although I\u2019ve been within one step of the end for so long all I have done is inch closer and closer to the edge year by year despite the fact that I'm close enough to end it at any moment. I\u2019ve been here for so long I\u2019m not afraid anymore.\n\nBut I\u2019m exhausted. I don\u2019t think I can keep living like this much longer. I need a way to snap myself back into reality and understand the severity of these thoughts and the actions I plan on taking. Because at this point in my life suicide doesn\u2019t feel like that big of a decision anymore.\n\nI am just finally beginning to reach out for help which got me thinking about how honest I can be without being hospitalized. I\u2019m aware this might be what I need but I\u2019m still not ready to admit that is what\u2019s best for me. If I\u2019m honest with a therapist and admit that I have a plan I doubt they would be able to understand that this is typical for me. I\u2019m having a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that a therapist would find the level of suicidal ideation I have concerning. The thought of suicide just feels so normal to me.\n\nAm I overexaggerating the extent of my suicidal thoughts or am I so numbed by them that I\u2019m unable to comprehend the severity of where I\u2019m at?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qejmel/subconsciously_normalized_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "Subconsciously normalized suicidal thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "scandinaviancow", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635044625, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qejmel/subconsciously_normalized_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427298.7061758, "replies_charged": false}
