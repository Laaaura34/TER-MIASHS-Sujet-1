They hate me and constantly pressurize me to be more religious even after I tell them it isnt for me. Im considered ungrateful and an overall terrible human being. Theyre quite conservative  so there are plenty of other things they would never accept about me. Im bisexual (closeted) and if they ever find out, theyll disown me. They also think Im cold hearted and lacking in compassion which I dont think is true. I am a compassionate person, Im just not good at handling emotionally charged moments cause they stress me out so I keep to myself. I hate myself. Im disgusted by myself and Im plagued by suicidal thoughts. Id never actually do it cuz it would devastate my family and friends, but I dont \nIike being alive. Im lonely and the only person I feel comfortable with is my best friend. I have social anxiety and constantly feel judged in social situations.Im worthless and a freak. I have had poor mental health for years and this just makes it all worse.
