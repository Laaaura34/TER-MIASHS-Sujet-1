They live with a kind of fear I will never have to live with and that\u2019s not fair\n\nSeeing and hearing neurotypicals bullying neurodivergent people, calling them the r-word and doing stereotypical handicapped gestures to oppress them makes my blood boil because like\u2026how fcking dare you!?!!\n\nAll the stories about parents hitting their children, forcing them to live a certain way simply because of what\u2019s between their legs, shaming them for who they want to and not want to date/have sex with, calling them names and even slurs, and are able to get away with it but god forbid the child calls their parents toxic because they are and the whole world spazzes out on the child for being a \u201cbrat\u201d and \u201cinsensitive\u201d smh\n\nRecently seen a video of parents punishing their kids out of anger and like\u2026how can you go batshit crazy on your kid, see AND hear them cry so hard they sound like they\u2019re screaming at the top of their lungs and you just stand there with your finger up your ass watching them cry like you have no idea what\u2019s wrong with them and are unfazed by what you just did!?!?\n\nThe amount of times I\u2019ve seen homeless people on sidewalks and parking lots and hear them be told they\u2019re faking it for \u201cdrug money\u201d. Like nahhh fam maybe if you cultivated even a gram of this thing called empathy you\u2019d realize that they actually are suffering and have nowhere to go smh\n\nI could go on with millions of examples y\u2019all, I really could. I just can\u2019t stand all the small-minded, conceited, materialistic bigots in this world anymore. It\u2019s so hard not to end my life because how can so many people be so heartless?!!!\n\nThere\u2019s literally no prize for being the biggest asshole. You also won\u2019t be executed for being a good person. In fact it\u2019s much easier to be a good person than a godawful one\n\nI know all of this seems super childish but it really does make me suicidal because I\u2019m just so over this world\u2019s toxicity.
