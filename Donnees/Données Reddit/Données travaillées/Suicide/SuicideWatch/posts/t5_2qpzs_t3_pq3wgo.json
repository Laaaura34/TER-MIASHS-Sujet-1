My suicide is inevitable, so stopping it is futile. However I harbor some extreme evil. The kind that is simply unforgivable. I haven\u2019t acted on it yet, but if I\u2019m allowed to live for much longer someone will be horribly hurt. \n\nI\u2019m not worth saving or would there even be a slight positive effect of saving me. Yet I want to be saved. The better part of me knows that if I were to be saved that this world would suffer for it. \n\nIt\u2019s a constant internal struggle. I think the reason I\u2019m posting this here is some kind of effort from the part that wants to live. Yet this post is being composed by the better me who understands what needs to be done.\n\nSo I beg of you to please give me overwhelming evidence and reasoning for me to leave this world.
