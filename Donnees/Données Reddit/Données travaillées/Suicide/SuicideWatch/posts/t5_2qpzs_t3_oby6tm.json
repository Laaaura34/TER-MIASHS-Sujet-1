For context, I'm an introverted 19-year-old Asian male with mild autism. Combined with being 5'7/45kg and being a late-bloomer, my formative experiences were nearly exclusively of rejection and bullying. I used to be a very smart kid destined for Ivy leagues (perfect ACT at 14, top 5 in the state at math and chess, etc.) until being ostracized in high school ruined me. After being publicly flamed for my squeaky voice and being called \"chink/jap/faggot/virgin\" during sophomore year, I dropped out of school and did nothing but play video games in the basement for four years.\n\nI completed my GED and have two years of college credit under my belt from APs and attending community college, but the prospect of taking university classes in person next fall terrifies me. I hate being a short, awkward minority, and I wanna put a bullet through my skull for not going to CA or NY for school, where I at least wouldn't have to deal with racial struggles. Every tall white guy I see on the street reminds me of my high school bullies. I want so desperately to spend my life with a nice girl, but my past experiences have deprived me of all confidence. My greatest source of self-esteem hardly comforts me anymore; who knows if I'll even make as much as some idiot former HS bully with better social skills. **I was born in a world where my strengths don't matter and my shortcomings are doubly penalized.**\n\n\"Just lift, bro.\" Haha, I wish. I certainly would if I weren't a repressing trans woman. I chose to repress because I don't wanna force myself into a life of oppression/loneliness and because I'll never develop the traits that would most strongly trigger dysphoria (balding, body hair, wide shoulders, etc.). I'm still doing cardio and playing ping pong just to stay healthy, but I don't like the shredded look.\n\nI'm trapped in a cycle of anger and guilt for being resentful of my parents. I didn't have it that bad; they weren't abusive and they cared for me. I just fucking wish they didn't let me slip so hard. They're such carefree religious nutjobs who think \"god will make everything okay.\" Why didn't you encourage me to study for olympiads during my NEET days? Why didn't you tell me to work out more? Why didn't you stop me from sleeping on my stomach and losing an inch to posture? Why are you against me crossdressing because ancient primitives said it was an abomination against their magic sky wizard? It's not like you're gonna be grandparents anyway. Thanks for blaming me for my problems, dad, you're the one who gave me the autism and raised me in a 3% Asian state.\n\nI also feel depressed thinking about the life that was stolen from me. I'll never experience the feeling of accomplishment from reaching my full academic potential. I'll never experience messing around town at night with my friends. I'll never experience skipping stones by the lake with my high school sweetheart. I'll never experience the feeling of being loved.\n\nI apologize if I sound spoiled for posting about comparatively minor problems, but I feel like stabbing myself knowing I'll never experience what makes life worth living.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oby6tm/childhood_bullying_never_goes_away/", "title": "Childhood bullying never goes away", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sdbcsyhdsfh", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625182943, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oby6tm/childhood_bullying_never_goes_away/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427117.0139728, "replies_charged": false}
