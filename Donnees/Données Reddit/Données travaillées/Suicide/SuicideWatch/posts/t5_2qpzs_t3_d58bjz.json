Instead, I felt miserable. Everyone was writing messages for people they've lost to suicide and hanging them up for everyone to see. I feel so incredibly screwed up saying this, but as I read the messages, I was envious of the people they wrote about. I was jealous they had the guts to go through with it because I know I don't. This is my first time saying this out loud, because I am so fearful of being judged, but it feels good to get it off my chest.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d58bjz/i_participated_in_a_suicide_prevention_walk/", "title": "I participated in a suicide prevention walk yesterday and it made me feel more suicidal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ThatOneGirlMae", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 371, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1568675347, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d58bjz/i_participated_in_a_suicide_prevention_walk/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427885.5633914, "replies_charged": false}
