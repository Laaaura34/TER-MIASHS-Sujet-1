My family is subpar in the best light, narcissistic and hate-inducing at worst. It's to the point where I have had several self-loathing and contemplations whenever I'm alone. My friends are all but distant, and the ones I do have, it feels like I'm the crutch of it all. I've tried to improve and distract myself, with exercise and video games, but the reality sinks in again when school comes back. I'm almost at my breaking point, and I can't even get a therapist. I'm as good as dead.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kzu5y0/im_on_a_streak_of_misery_and_anger/", "title": "I'm on a streak of misery and anger.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Throwaway29472047294", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610974648, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kzu5y0/im_on_a_streak_of_misery_and_anger/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426881.0183613, "replies_charged": false}
