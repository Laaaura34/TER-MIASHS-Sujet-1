I need the anxiety to stop.\n\nMy hypochondria is driving me up the fucking walls! Over the last few days I\u2019ve convinced myself I clearly have diabetes from one elevated test, have failing kidneys/liver, and hypertension. I literally don\u2019t have any of those according to my doctor. But god dammit I spend so long everyday crying about it and researching it and scaring myself and working out and stressing about what I eat (which has become only a handful of save foods).\n\nAnd it\u2019s never FUCKING ENOUGH.\n\nI can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m so tired. I\u2019m so so fucking tired. And I tried so hard. I tried. I wish my anorexia would have killed me when I was thinner. I hate this. I don\u2019t want to be alive.\n\nI just can\u2019t function like this anymore. I\u2019m a failure. There\u2019s no fucking hope for me. Whenever I feel happy for even a quarter of a second all of my fears come back to me and I just break down once more. I\u2019m so tired of crying. I\u2019m so tired of plain meals that are honestly pathetic. I\u2019m so tired of relapsing but in this way that makes it 10x worse. But no one takes me seriously because of hypochondria. I wish they\u2019d take me seriously. I want a new body. I NEED a new body.\n\nI want to kill this one more than anything but god dammit I don\u2019t want to die. That\u2019s why I do all this. I simply don\u2019t want to fucking die. But if this is my life then maybe it\u2019s time. Maybe I\u2019ve outstayed my welcome. I always joked that nature was trying to pick me off, but deep down I always believed it.\n\nI just want it all to stop. Please. Just make the anxiety go away.
