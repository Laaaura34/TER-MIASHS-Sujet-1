I hate my job, I feel like I'm going to school just to get a dead end job in Mechanical Engineering, I am ultra broke, I never get to see my family or my girlfriend.\n\nI am living by myself far away from all the people I love. I recently broke off connections with my 2 high school best friends of 7 years. My recently divorced parents both make over 120k and they are helping pay for me to go to school. My dad is extremely insistent that I finish this degree. They pay for rent and tuition exclusively, so I am left with things like groceries, gas, phone, car repair, insurance, etc. Trying to do full time school and work enough to make what I need to survive has been extremely taxing for the last 3 years. I never have more than $10/month extra. I cut costs on food usually and I have lost 10 pounds in the last year, which made my dad angry with me since I'm only 130lb to start.\n\nI was so happy during my junior year of high school. I think about it every single day. I doubt I will ever be that happy again. I feel like I am wasting my teens and twenties. I regret every day that I live. There is nothing to look forward to. My life has peaked and it will never be as good as it was my junior year.\n\nIf my girlfriend left me, I really would have no reasons left to be alive.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nwygpu/i_regret_everyday_that_i_wake_up/", "title": "I regret everyday that I wake up.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hugeshithead", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623359020, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nwygpu/i_regret_everyday_that_i_wake_up/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427124.036351, "replies_charged": false}
