The lines between imagination and reality are just becoming blurrier and blurrier, thinking about it frustrates me, i just can't figure anything out anymore. \n\nI feel people just talk to me out of pity, i just want everyone to leave me alone, i want everyone to forget out me, i just wish there weren't any repercussions to just offing myself, i wish it didn't hurt anyone, i wish it didn't make anyone sad. \n\n\nI'm itching for it. Everytime i face these mental obstacles another permanent mosquito bite gets added to the bunch. \n\nI want to learn from all this, i want to understand why i see what i see and hear what i hear, why i have these nightmares, but it's all just a mess with no direction or clear reason to being the way it is.\n\nI'm in pain, so much pain. i don't want useless pity conversations, they don't help, talk to me if you care, but just stay away and out of it if you don't. i want everybody to forget i exist, so i don't disappoint anyone anymore, so i can't make anybody sad when i finally scratch that itch in the back of my mind.\n\nI'm here for them, to make them happy, to see them smile, to see the laugh and have fun, but when they forget and take their own path, and i know they will, i can end this painful existence.\n\n\nI'm trying my best, i really am.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qb0b9x/stressed_and_angry/", "title": "stressed and angry", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "long_shlong_mgee", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634604980, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qb0b9x/stressed_and_angry/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423131.4780798, "replies_charged": false}
