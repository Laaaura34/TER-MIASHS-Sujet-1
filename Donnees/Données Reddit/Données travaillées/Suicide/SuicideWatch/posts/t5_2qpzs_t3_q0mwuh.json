I\u2019ve been having suicidal thoughts for almost a year now and the arrival of my birthday only enforces the thought that my life is going nowhere in my mind. \nThis Friday I searched my garage for an adequate rope or cord to hang myself with, I found one, frayed and old. It\u2019s not the prettiest, but I hoped it would do the job. I tied it into a crude noose and hid it in my room, I\u2019d kill myself the night of my birthday I told myself. And I did plan to, except, the day before my birthday my dad shows up at my door as a surprise (we live in different states), seeing him, hearing his corny jokes and prideful eyes. I can\u2019t do it, I so badly want to but I cant, what person would I be leaving my family behind like that? \nI can confidently say they are the main thing keeping me alive at the moment, if not the only thing. I dont consider myself a priority to anyone, including myself, but its different my with family. I cant put them through this hell even though I so badly want to end it. \nDespite these sentiments, I worry that one of these days I will not be able to. see clearly, and I will do it despite my common sense telling me not to.\nI do not know what to do. \nI feel so alone in life despite living with two of my four relatives. Is it teen angst? Is it depression? Anxiety? Social anxiety? Why exactly do I feel this way? I cant answer that question directly. \nThough sometimes I feel bad that my life isnt \u201cbad\u201d enough for me to be suicidal. Im too \u201celoquent, and well dressed, and cheery\u201d to feel the way I do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q0mwuh/i_came_dangerously_close_to_ending_it_this_weekend/", "title": "I came dangerously close to ending it this weekend", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LooseEndsZoomin", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633283578, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q0mwuh/i_came_dangerously_close_to_ending_it_this_weekend/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425512.9123135, "replies_charged": false}
