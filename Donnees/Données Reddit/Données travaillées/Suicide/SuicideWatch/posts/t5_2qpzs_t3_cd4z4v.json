I just can't keep doing this. I've Tried my hardest to try make myself better, I have been diagnosed with depression and bulimia in the past ,  Im not depressed anymore but I'm pretty much just done with life. No goals, nothing to show for myself, and its not even like i feel like a failure. i just dont care. Im not even sure if I want this baby.. even though I tried so hard for them , I\u2019ve previously had 2 losses missed miscarriage and a miscarriage and I feel guilty and so crap about them ,But I can't take him  away from his dad ,So I'm going to give him this gift and I think I\u2019m going to do what I've wanted to do for so long since I was in my early teens , I\u2019ve already voiced what I\u2019ve needed to say to my partner but they don\u2019t understand how I feel and what it\u2019s like , he has also said he doesn\u2019t want to look after them if I\u2019m not here and I feel like a person that is going to be trapped with everyThing and what happens if I\u2019m not here , he will need to look after him . I feel guilty that I am already making myself sick all the time too , I think I\u2019ve made up my mind and I needed to get it out there , I\u2019ve already made a book with a few letters for my son to read if I do leave him explaining why .\n\nIts not that there is really something wrong. Im just not living happy . Its a conscious decision not made by depressed thinking. I just want to fall asleep in peace and never wake up. The whole thing just seems Easier to me ..I\u2019m sorry \n\n\nJust needed to get this out.
