I know for a fact that if I was gone people would grow concerned but only for a moment and then move on with their lives. I\u2019m tired of being. I\u2019m tired of looking for what I\u2019m going to do. And I\u2019m tired of worrying about relapsing. Honestly that is a good idea. Just have one more run before I get a exit bag and peace out. I don\u2019t want to exist anymore and my family is one of the only things holding me back but I\u2019m getting to the point where even that doesn\u2019t matter. Im 20 and I can feel my life slipping away from me and soon enough there is going to need to be a change. I don\u2019t know what though.\nEdit: I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m  done flirting with ideas and need some action in my life for a change", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pzlafk/i_flip_flop_between_and_death_and_living_i_want/", "title": "I flip flop between and death and living.
