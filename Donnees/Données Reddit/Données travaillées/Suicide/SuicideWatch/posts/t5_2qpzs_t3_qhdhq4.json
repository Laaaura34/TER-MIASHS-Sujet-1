I want to work my way out and find another job, but when I search for jobs, I can't find a match for me. I'm struggling with my current job and worried about being fired. I've been 'let go' from jobs two times before in my life and it's the most gut-wrenching feeling I ever faced. I struggle with extreme ADHD and can't seem to focus on getting my life in check. Fear of suicide is looming over my head immensely. Almost as a way to say *give up and all the pain will be gone*. I feel numb, it's like I feel disconnected from the world sometimes. Last night I collapsed on the floor out of the blue and felt no pain. I keep wishing I could go back to my younger self in college and tell myself to focus on what I want to do with my life instead of all those hours hiding in my apartment.\n\nMy senior year of college I survived a near suicide attack and from that I felt a rush of excitement for life. It was my motivation to stay alive. Now I feel that flame from that excitement is burned out.\n\nThe things in life that usually give me hope now feel numb compared to the pressure I am feeling from my suicidal thoughts. Just looking for a little help since I feel I can't bring this up with anyone in my personal life. I see a therapist, but that's on a monthly basis and my suicidal thoughts have only popped up the past couple of days.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhdhq4/my_suicidal_thoughts_are_back/", "title": "My suicidal thoughts are back", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DJDanyl", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635390346, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhdhq4/my_suicidal_thoughts_are_back/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427338.7497807, "replies_charged": false}
