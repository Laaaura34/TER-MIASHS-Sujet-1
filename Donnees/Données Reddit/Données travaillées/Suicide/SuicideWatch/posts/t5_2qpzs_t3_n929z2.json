I feel like I\u2019m doomed into this life, these past few weeks I\u2019ve cried and died inside more and more because of the constant anxiety and intrusive thoughts. I fear I might also have a learning difficulty but how on earth would I tell my family? And how do I get the proper test at this age. Everything just builds up on me one by one, when I feel like I am getting better I realise that I AM NOT. I\u2019m just lying for my family, doctors refused to repeat my sleeping pills so I just don\u2019t sleep or \u201coverdose\u201d on the ones that literally do nothing for my anxiety. I struggle with school, no friends like literally 0 and family. At home I\u2019m always on edge it could be any minute and my dad will freak out scream attack me insult me or hit my mother.\nIn this situation I fear I do not have the chance to heal, is everyday a deeper cut. \nSo I\u2019m tired of pretending everything can still get better. So I ask what\u2019s the best way to off myself preferably with pills but I seem to always fail, this time has to be lethal, I do not want to suffer anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n929z2/done_it_all_its_lethal/", "title": "Done it all, it\u2019s lethal.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gloriawastaken", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 26, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620646365, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n929z2/done_it_all_its_lethal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427386.738174, "replies_charged": false}
