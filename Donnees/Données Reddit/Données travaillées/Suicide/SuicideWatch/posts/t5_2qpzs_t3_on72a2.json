This lady sounded SO insanely bored, I've talked to Internet-provider customer service workers with more pep and care.\n\nWas in the midst of a crisis, at a total loss. I couldn't think straight, struggling to talk with an even voice through tears. It was like she didn't even listen to what I was saying.\n\nI used precious vacation days and spent the last week off from work because of my mental health. Instead of taking steps to get better like I planned, I couldn't even get off the couch to brush my teeth or cook. I have to go back to work tomorrow and know I simply cannot do it, I can't even get dressed. But I used up all my vacation days, and I DESPERATELY need money. For the last 5 months until July, I was paying two rents because I had to move early due to WFM protocol ending, and was just BARELY scraping by. I have a lot of medical debt, paying 200/month for past therapies. I can't go to a doctor right now, I simply don't have the money. I already have a $500+ backlog of payments to make to my current therapist, who's been graciously patient while I get my finances in order.\n\nI told her all this, and she was like in this flat tone \"okay, what's your plan C?\" as if it was just the easiest thing I could come up with on the spot. And I was just, stunned in silence for a moment, and then just hung up.\n\nThis just feeds as another sign that this world is horrible and life isn't worth living. I look desperately for help, and can't find any. All the songs, all the virtue signaling of \"just ask for help, just call this number!\" was empty. This promised bastion of hope and help was as shitty and hopeless as everything else. The top result for google searches of \"depression hotline\" or \"mental health crisis hotline\" is all ads for things that look like scams. It feels so hopeless.\n\nI just needed to vent. I emailed my therapist asking for his guidance, so at least tomorrow I will have something to go on.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/on72a2/just_called_the_suicide_prevention_hotline_im_in/", "title": "Just called the Suicide Prevention Hotline, I'm in absolute shock by how horrible it was", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway1516444", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 171, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626669986, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/on72a2/just_called_the_suicide_prevention_hotline_im_in/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427810.9902666, "replies_charged": false}
