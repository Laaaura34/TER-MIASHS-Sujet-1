This friend means so much to me and the thought they\u2019re sick or hurt without me knowing even a little bit is distressing, they always said they\u2019d be here for me, unlike the other people who just dropped me out of their lives with no closure. Which is why I cringe to her so much, she is the only person who messages me first for a conversations. To think I might lose her feels terrible. \n\nAfter that I began worrying about how much I\u2019ve screwed up: university application, AS levels, any sport I tried, any hobby I dragged my self through to try and be a better or even happy human and the best romantic relationship I\u2019ll ever get. I just don\u2019t do good things no matter the effort, but I\u2019m uncertain if I\u2019ve put any effort into living besides the bare minimum. It all comes back to how I\u2019m a non-human who lacks any good qualities despite every advantage and chance handed to me. I know I can\u2019t achieve anything good without massive burdensome help from others, who try to help me as an individual be better. It all just seems like a lie to me, every time anyone says I\u2019ve done a good thing or am a good person I get angry at their lies. They don\u2019t know me like I know me, and I know I\u2019m a awful person. \n\nI think I\u2019m intrinsically broken, I\u2019m unable to find reasons why I\u2019m friends with the people I am or why they\u2019re friends with me. There doesn\u2019t feel like there is anything there of substance beside a shared proximity of about 7 years. Or how I lack anything besides a passive \u201clike\u201d for my parents who have given me the world and more. I want to love them but I feel such distance from them. They\u2019re two good people who got saddled with an inept child like me and they deserve better.  \n\nI\u2019m looking at a fucking downhill slope of a life fit for mountain bike track. I\u2019m going to uni in a week, maybe, if I\u2019m able to scrape together enough fucking competence to get finances in order, but the last time I did this subject I failed. If I fail university which is likely I am terrified about what the future holds, so I might cut it short or rope it short; besides being unfunny and awful, I\u2019m also indecisive.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d1mjcp/my_thoughts_spiral/", "title": "My thoughts Spiral", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sweetest-of-Sour", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1568006476, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d1mjcp/my_thoughts_spiral/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426701.4117916, "replies_charged": false}
