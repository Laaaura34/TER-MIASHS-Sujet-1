And in that second instance wanting to encourage other people to get out as well.\n\nI have a very strong moral compass, and I try to tap into that as much as possible, but this one general area is something that is super flimsy in me. \n\nI think it really took root when I took a philosophy class and my professor mentioned he was an Anti-Natalist, and explained why.   \n\n\nEssentially, the conceit of Anti-Natalism is that you shouldn't have kids because you have no idea how bad the world can get for them. It can come from within the child's upbringing from you fucking up or from outside circumstances you can't control, but bringing up a child is immoral because you have no guarantee that that child will be happy. At all.   \n\n\nSo, I took this to what to me is the next logical step. If having a child is immoral because life sucks, then living is a needless exercise in self-torment (except, you know, none of us chose to live). \n\nI just feel like so many people are just going through the motions. Nobody's happy. Why don't we ALL kill ourselves? It seems that being able to have as complex of mental processes as humans do can only lead to exponentially greater suffering.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/iqelez/my_struggle_between_altruism_and_selfdestruction/", "title": "My struggle between altruism and self-destruction.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SausageSlam", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1599779279, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/iqelez/my_struggle_between_altruism_and_selfdestruction/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422533.873548, "replies_charged": false}
