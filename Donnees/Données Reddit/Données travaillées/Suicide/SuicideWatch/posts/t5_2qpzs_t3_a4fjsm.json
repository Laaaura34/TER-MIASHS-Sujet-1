Not in a dissociative way, cause I've felt that, but in this really weird light-headed way that I've never experienced before. I haven't felt grounded in months and I originally I thought it was just moving anxiety, but it's been months and it seems like this feeling is here to stay. And now everything sets me off. Like it's been three years since I've cut myself, and now I'm cutting myself nonstop and my suicidal behavior is getting worse, but it's not the depressive-kinda suicide, but the anxiety kind?  I don't know. Last year I attempted suicide twice in the same week, and I haven't attempted suicide yet here, but should I be concerned? I don't know and my anxiety has certainly gotten worse, but that tired-kinda depression isn't nearly as strong as before.
