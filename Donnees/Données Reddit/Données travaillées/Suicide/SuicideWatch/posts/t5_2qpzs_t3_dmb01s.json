Its manageable for me, I make extra payments, and by no means is it causing my suicidal thoughts...however... when I purchased life insurance I made sure it would cover more than the amount of my student loans as to not financially burden my retired parents or low income siblings. As you may have guessed, most life insurance providers include a suicide exclusion. Has anyone researched topics related to what happens to your debt when you choose your time to leave? I've read awful stories where loan providers go after your next of kin. I feel stuck, and (shocker) living just to pay off my high interest private student loans is not motivating.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dmb01s/life_insurance_suicide_exclusion/", "title": "Life Insurance / Suicide Exclusion?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "1234InternetSt", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1571889550, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dmb01s/life_insurance_suicide_exclusion/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427097.488849, "replies_charged": false}
