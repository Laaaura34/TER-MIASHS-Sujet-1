No motivation no desire no hobbies no interests, I managed to miss out or just absolutely waste all the amazing opportunities that were given to me because of my apathy. I wish I wasn\u2019t so useless, but here I am currently in university and procrastinating my homework due today wanting nothing but death.\n\nI really don\u2019t think I\u2019m fit for this world whatsoever.
