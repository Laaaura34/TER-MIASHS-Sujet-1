I dream every night and they are so vivid that it makes not want to wake up because while I am sleeping I feel at peace. But then I wakeup every morning knowing that when night comes I am going to want to kill myself and I have to stop myself. and I dont stop myself because I dont wanna die, I stop myself because I think of all the people I will kill if i do end my life. I'm in limbo because is like do you cause the pain and suffering of a lot of people  by killing yourself or do you spare them that pain by sticking it out and being miserable. I am miserable lying to myself and everyone around me, I am disgusting the shit that goes in my mind is disgusted and twisted and sad and I block it. Dont get me wrong my life is about perfect in a basic sense. I have a job, I live in an apartment  with roommates but its nice i have my own space, my family is healthy except my grandpa who is basically my dad, my friends are amazing and wonderful. BUT I AM MISERABLE I hate lying and feeling like I shouldn't be here everyday I have to stop and make a piss poor attempt to convince myself that these people actually want me here. I am SOO FUCKING TIRED of my brain running at 357890489 miles an hour. I had a shit childhood with  a lot of good things mixed in there but with my mom being Mexican I didn't have a good mental health growing up. I never got that talk I was told it was all an exaggeration or It was all for attention, that is why I dont self harm my body anymore instead I developed similar destructive tendencies. The voices wont let me rest they are judging me and making me remember and panic. Therapy has just made it worse its like I cant completely come clean with them or with myself.\n\ni dont know why i wrote this, I maybe shouldn't have I needed to voice it to see if anyone relates? I am not gonna kill myself because i do see hope in the future because im not choosing to hurt the people i care about but I am dying inside by doing so. Also im a psych major and pre med so I am aware I have problems im crystal clear about it", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k0ky6i/i_am_not_okay_i_am_not_brave_enough_to_end_it_i/", "title": "I am not Okay, I am not Brave enough to End it, I am in Limbo and that itself is killing me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bichotashorty", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606277785, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k0ky6i/i_am_not_okay_i_am_not_brave_enough_to_end_it_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426218.5263097, "replies_charged": false}
