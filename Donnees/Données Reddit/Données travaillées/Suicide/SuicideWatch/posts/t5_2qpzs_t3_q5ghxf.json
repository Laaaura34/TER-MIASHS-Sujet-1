I quit my job to get better but I keep lashing out at everyone I love. I'm hurting my family.. I've become a bad friend by not communicating. This morning I keep imagining how I'll die, over and over. I'm also taking weed tolerance break because I've been using it everynight for the past year.. it was making me paranoid and it's been a few days while I've been sober. I don't care enough to eat. I really have no one my friends moved away. My bf is deployed but he probably thinks I'm crazy. He doesn't try to understand my anxious thoughts in public and when I told him about me thinking I had depression he just suggested group therapy..if he knew the extent he'd call me \"retarded\" I'm sick with myself for letting me love someone who uses that type of language. I keep feeling sorry for myself and I can't break free no matter how much I journal or work with my inner child. I have no health insurance or money so I can't even go to the ER", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5ghxf/i_keep_imagining_myself_dead_idk_how_to_move_on/", "title": "I keep imagining myself dead.
