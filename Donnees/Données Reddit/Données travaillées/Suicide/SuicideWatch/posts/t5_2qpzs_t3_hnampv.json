I\u2019m sorry\u201d. I felt relief and would soon be done with the numbness and pain. Friend called right before. He wanted to catch up. Talked for a few hours. Lifted my spirits. Tore up the note. Didn\u2019t take long for darkness creep back. Last month started having intense heart palpitations one night. Gained lot of weight. Lose breathe when I climb stairs. Always been large guy but it\u2019s been getting bad. I was praying it was a heart attack. It wouldn\u2019t be suicide, friends and family wouldn\u2019t feel guilt. It would be my fault for not taking better care. Was devastated when I felt the sunrise through my bedroom window the next morning. Today marks the day I need to prepare for my suicide before my 26th birthday in the fall. A pact I made myself in January if I couldn\u2019t find a decent job. 26th birthday being when I get cut from my family\u2019s insurance and when I need to start paying student loans. It\u2019s been hard to get motivated. Haven\u2019t been seen my friends since COVID started. My immigrant parents don\u2019t understand mental health. They criticize others who struggle depression. Fear what they would say if I would share my feelings. I always grew up with the idea that if you work hard everything works out. Nobody teaches what you do when it doesn\u2019t when you do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hnampv/i_tried_my_best/", "title": "I tried my best.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "themitchpow", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594183138, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hnampv/i_tried_my_best/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427756.1091123, "replies_charged": false}
