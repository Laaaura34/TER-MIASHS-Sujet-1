I can die any time. Why rush? I\u2019ll keep going just in case I find something beautiful on the way out. But I\u2019m going full steam ahead. It feels good to let your inhibitions go and simply be. Aggressive, direct, unhinges. What\u2019s the worst that can happen? Someone gets road rage and shoots me dead? Lol. Jokes on him, I wanted to die and now I got him to do all the work for me. People gonna get pissed or uncomfortable with me for going totally unfiltered? Cool, fewer people that I need  to make sad when I die. I don\u2019t need to worry about my health either. If I get sick I\u2019ll just die. If it hurts? I\u2019ll get a prescription for painkillers and chug a fifth of vodka to wash it down. I\u2019m finally in control. I finally just don\u2019t care, and it feels so powerful. You all should try it, too. It\u2019s amazing.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bcb8ww/freedom/", "title": "Freedom", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Slippingdownintoit", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1555058576, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bcb8ww/freedom/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426438.564996, "replies_charged": false}
