Why can\u2019t it be my choice to leave it? \n\nSuicide is seen as selfish. As if drugging someone so heavily that their shell remains in your life is helping them and not saving yourself from facing the grief of losing them. How is that less selfish than someone who is suffering daily from the effects of depression, ending their pain?\n\nMy mom says \u201cI can\u2019t keep worrying every day that you\u2019re going to kill yourself.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t it be better if I just did it then? So you can grieve and not worry anymore? \n\nI hate this life. I was brought into this world and now have to make money and work and be a functioning member of a society that I don\u2019t even want to be a part of. Why does everyone make it so hard to quit living? And every method has the chance of being unsuccessful. Why can\u2019t I just opt for death and have a doctor administer a lethal dose of something? I\u2019d sign my life away tomorrow. Donate my organs.
