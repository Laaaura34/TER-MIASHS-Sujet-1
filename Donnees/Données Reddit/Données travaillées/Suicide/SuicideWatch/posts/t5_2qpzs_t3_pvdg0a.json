Everything that anyone can ever deal with had happened with me. From migraines to being diagnosed with celiac disease, to getting unstoppable cramps and nausea, to having GERD, then depression hitting me again, along with bulimia acting up and never letting me enjoy one good day... All of it is pulling me down the loop again, and I'm considering suicide way more than I want to. Sometimes I take in way more pills than I'm supposed to with the hopes of never waking up, sometimes I cut in order to get my mind off of hanging myself, sometimes I eat gluten intentionally to hurt my intestines so I can maybe start to develop a malignant tumor. I'm just so suicidal. And lately I've gotten attached to someone who helped me a lot and then he decided to take a break from me so I'm feeling so alone with no one to help me in my dark times. It's just such a huge burden that I'm carrying on my shoulder and I see everyone around having to deal with me and I don't want that anymore. I want it to stop. I want it to end. I want the pain to go away. I don't want to suffer in this life. I just feel like dying is my only option and I'm hanging on by a mere thread so as to not do anything harmful. It hurts so bad to live...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pvdg0a/suicidal_ideation_is_the_norm_for_me/", "title": "Suicidal ideation is the norm for me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "daniabear", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632597075, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pvdg0a/suicidal_ideation_is_the_norm_for_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422924.1818702, "replies_charged": false}
