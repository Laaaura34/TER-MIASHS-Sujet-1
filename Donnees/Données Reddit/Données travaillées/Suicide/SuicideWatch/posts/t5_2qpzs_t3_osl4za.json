I then plan on living rough and starving myself until i cannot physically starve myself any longer.  I then plan to either hang myself or drown myself. \nDue to the high heart rate due to starvation, and the already low blood pressure due to it too, I will pass out very quickly.  I will also have a higher chance of dying when unconscious, either due to a heart attack or the norms causes of death via this form of suicide.\n\nI have anorexia so I'm pretty much a pro when it comes to not eating, so I'll be able to do so.  I also have experienced heart problems and passing out due to not eating so i know when I'll be ready.\n\nI just want to minimise the suffering and cognitive brain functions, so I'll be more unlikely to subconsciously talk myself out of dying (like I did last time ).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/osl4za/i_wrote_this_a_while_ago_and_do_not_remeber_doing/", "title": "I wrote this a while ago and do not remeber doing so.
