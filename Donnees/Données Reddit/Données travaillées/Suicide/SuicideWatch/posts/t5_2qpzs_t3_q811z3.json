It\u2019s exhausting. I\u2019ve phone hotlines which are shit. I\u2019ve had counselling which doesn\u2019t do squat. The thought of end the pain of life is relieving. I\u2019m a mum of 2 small kids. I haven\u2019t slept the night through for 7 years. I don\u2019t love my husband. He doesn\u2019t understand and is done with empathy. I feel like what do I have left to try? I feel ugly fat and alone. I get no joy\u2026ever.
