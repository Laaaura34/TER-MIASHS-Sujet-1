I'm 22 years old, parents divorced, living with my father and my 12 year old brother. I don't speak with my mother very often, and I know that hurts her. I have no job (occasionally I work with my father - more on that later), kicked out of university with no degree, no money. I have a solid group of friends, but I don't know that I can trust them, and I worry they will leave me. I think a lot about dying. \n\nWhen I was 7 years old, my parents (together at the time) hosted a Christmas party. I had a sister, who was 5, and a brother, who was 1 and a half. The brother I live with now was not yet born.\nThe party was a small affair, just family friends and their children. Two sisters slept over that night. One died. \n\nThey still aren't sure how the fire started. They believe a cigarette was tossed in the garbage, and that during the night flames managed to travel to the roof through a drain pipe. The fire burned from the top of the house down, burning out the smoke alarms. It wasn't until the neighbours saw the flames that the fire department was called.\n\nMy mother jumped out a window. My father ran in and out of the house trying to find his children until he eventually collapsed on the lawn, covered in burns. My brother was crushed by a falling piece of the ceiling. My sister, and one of the sisters who stayed over were caught in a room and smothered while they slept. Myself, and they other sister who slept over were in my room (I had a bunk bed and she was a close friend). \n\nI remember looking out the window and seeing a curtain orange and red lights flashing, but that's it. I'm told I stopped my friend from opening the door because of something I'd learned at school - something about low pressure zones and heat. We stayed in the bed, she on the bottom bunk and me on the top. When I passed out from inhalation, I fell from the bed, which I firefighter saw from the outside. He rescued my friend and I. I wish he'd left me. I wish he'd been there in time to save my brother and sister. I wish he'd saved both the sister's who had stayed over. They wouldn't have been there if not for my friendship with one of them.\n\nThis is likely why my parents split. Their divorce didn't bother me, but I know it hurts my brother. He was born 4 years after the fire. They divorced 4 years after that.\n\nI don't remember much about the following few years. I don't expect many do, 7-13 are formative but not quite interesting enough to retain. My mom seemed convinced I was destined for great things, and I think I believed her for a while. I wasn't engaged in elementary school, but my parents and my teachers seemed to think I was extremely gifted, and when I went to high school I was placed in honours courses. I skipped the first general science courses and went straight into physics and biology (my high school had science 8, science 9, and in grade 10 students could choose between physics, chemistry, and biology courses). My first year in high school I excelled. \n\nIn grade 9, at 14, I started drinking and smoking a lot of pot. I would steal cigarettes from my parents and sell them to students, and raid my parents' liquor cabinet to get a buzz before school. I'd found a flask in my dad's room and I'd fill it for the day. When I turned 15 I started doing ecstasy and cocaine. At 16 my friend, we'll call him Jerry, told the school councillor what was going on with me. I got off the blow and the MDMA but I never really stopped drinking. At this time I was rarely at school, and by 17 I'd dropped out. I didn't deserve these opportunities. I wanted to stop existing and I resented myself for being cared about.\n\nIn high school I had formed very close relationships with several people. They were a group of people I considered a family. I'd have died for them, and I believed they felt the same way. Over the years a couple \"members\" dropped from the group, but we'd still stay in touch. \n\nOne girl in the group, we'll call her Crystal, and I started seeing each other. We ended up beginning a relationship. About a year in we began living together at my father's house. She pushed my to get my GED at 20. She convinced to me to go to university. My tuition is free until I'm 25, given that my mother still works there as a professor. Seemed a shame to squander that opportunity. I was still drinking. I had stopped smoking pot.\n\nI began university at 21. My first semester was okay, I had just been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and started on medication. I cut down drinking. I wasn't very engaged and I didn't do very well, in class. The following semester started strong. The Crystal split. After 3 years of being together, she left me to immediately move on to another friend in our friend group. I'd considered him a brother, and she a best friend, and I was crushed. All our mutual friends abandoned me. I began drinking a lot again, forgetting to take my medication, and spiralled downward. I failed all my courses, and was kicked out of school for a low GPA. \n\nI ended up reconnecting with one of the old friend's who'd left the group. He introduced my to my new friend group, all really solid guys. I want to trust them, to feel like I have a family like the last group. I'm not sure I can. We're at the present now. I'm not sure I deserve the caring people in my life. I wish they didn't care.\n\nI was just laid off from my warehouse job. I didn't save anything, and I am deep into my overdraft and credit. I spend too much on beer and cigarettes. I found it impossible to get out of bed many days. I hate saying that. It sounds like a cop-out. It sounds like I'm just a lazy piece of shit. Maybe I am. I have much to be happy about, if only I'd put in some minimal effort. \nI'm working with my dad now, off and on. He knows about my depression. He tries to be there. He doesn't quite know how. He tries to be supportive, but I can tell he's irritated. I hate that I'm such a fucking burden to him.\n\nWhen I say I'm working with him off and on, I mean some days/weeks I'll be up, and I'll enthusiastically get up to go to work and I'll kick ass. Most days, I can't pull myself out of bed. I fall back asleep. I hate myself.\n\nHe keeps giving me chances to work with him and make some money but I keep fucking it up. My little brother tells me I'm the greatest big brother because I'm not mean to him like other big brothers are to their siblings. He's not old enough yet to realize how much of a failure I am.\n\nMore often than not I think about dying. I don't think I'm planning on killing myself, so I don't even know if I'm fucking suicidal. I just know I'm always thinking about swerving into oncoming traffic or off a bridge. I know I consider tying a weight to my feet and jumping in the pool. I know I regularly google ways to end it quickly and painlessly. I worry sometimes that I'm getting closer and closer to committing to something I can't come back from.\n\nI find myself wishing no one loved me. I hate being a burden. I hate that I'm so unmotivated. I hate that any explanation I have for why I'm not doing anything and why I'm staying at home on my dad's dime playing video games and drinking and chain smoking makes me sound like a lazy fuck. Maybe I am a lazy fuck. I don't know why I can't bring myself to leave the house most days. I don't even enjoy the video games or the drinking or the sleeping. It's just all I can do.\n\nHow the fuck do I stop feeling this way? How do I live up to the potential my parents and friends believe I have? How do I bring myself to get up and go? How do I find motivation? \n\nI don't want pity. Please don't give me that. My story is here to hopefully garner some amount of understanding as to how I got where I am. \"Know where you've been to know where you are and where you're going\" kind of thing. I'm looking for some kind of suggestion. A solution that isn't killing myself. I don't know where to go or what to do. I guess conceptually I know I need to get a job and/or go back to school, but I don't know that I can commit myself to getting up and doing that. \n\nFuck, I have such a hard to explaining this. I've been wanting to write a post for so long, but it always comes out meandering and unfocused, this is no exception. I just feel like there's this heavy blanket on my, holding my down, and something is preventing my from throwing it off. \n\nAgain, if this is the wrong place please tell me and I'll move it. I feel weird telling you all about this. Its not fair for me to put this burden on you all. Just another example as to why it would be better for me to just not exist. I seem to have lost the point of this, though I'm sure it's buried in this wall of text somewhere. Sorry for the near-incoherent ramblings. Still on the bottle. Thanks for reading y'all. Im not likely to kill myself, so give your assistance to those who deserve and need it.\nEDIT: no matter what happens or doesn't happen, this felt very good to get off my chest.
