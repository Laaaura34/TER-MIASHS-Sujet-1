I've always wanted to end my life, and I tried once but it didn't work (OD'ing on pills is so ineffective). I've always wanted to not feel like this, but I don't know what to do. I really want to die, but I have a friend who I made a suicide pact with and want her to stay alive so I resist all urges. I wanna die tho, and every passing day I feel myself slipping farther away to the point where I frequent feeling detached and dissociated. The only reason I'm still alive right now is because of my friend, but I wanna kill myself. I just don't know how to do it without it affecting her and our pact because she will kill herself if I do it. This is more of a rant and just want to get my thoughts out there instead of bottling them up more.
