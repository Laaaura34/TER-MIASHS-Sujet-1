I normally don\u2019t fit in at these kind of events but because it\u2019s my friends birthday and we live in the same house I joined in. I socialized and had fun but now I just feel empty. I\u2019m just laying down and can\u2019t fall asleep for the reason in the title. I\u2019m not even trying to have sex or anything but I\u2019m just so starved of love and compassion that I can\u2019t help but feel like shit. I just wonder what the hell is wrong with me, why has no girl ever shown any signs of being interested in me in the slightest. I don\u2019t blame them but I still just feel like I\u2019m going to be alone for ever and that\u2019s scary as my life already has me suicidal without this extra stuff.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qe03lq/i_cant_sleep_because_i_can_hear_my_housemates/", "title": "I can\u2019t sleep because I can hear my housemates getting laid and it makes me wanna off myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "myalt0", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634973706, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qe03lq/i_cant_sleep_because_i_can_hear_my_housemates/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635422990.996343, "replies_charged": false}
