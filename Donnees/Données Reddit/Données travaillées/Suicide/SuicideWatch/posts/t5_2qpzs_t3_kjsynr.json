I want something quicker, more painless, and more devastating to look at.\n\nI have a few methods in mind, but it'll be hard to pull off. Failure is 100% my biggest fear right now. If I try and fail, everything will be *so much fucking worse*.\n\nI'll never have independence. I'll be even more trapped. Suffocated by people's love for me. But is it really love? It feels more like they just want me to suffer more.\n\nThe best thing for me is to be alone. It's what I want. No one nagging or checking in. No one getting after me for not taking care of myself.\n\nI let my health degrade because it's what I *want*. I want to wither away and self destruct in peace.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kjsynr/let_me_self_destruct_in_oeace/", "title": "Let me self destruct in oeace", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Lousewomb", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608870123, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kjsynr/let_me_self_destruct_in_oeace/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422546.5686853, "replies_charged": false}
