I have cut tonight for the first time in months and I forgot how empowering it was. also tonight I sat in the waiting room of a lifeline chat for a long time before giving up on talking to someone. it was my first time attempting to use the lifeline and I know calling would have been more rewarding but I could not stop crying long enough to justify calling since I would not have been able to speak clearly. I am very much considering committing myself as soon as possible but I would want it to be discrete and have no one know but I also know that if I were to just disappear without a single soul knowing where I was then someone will probably eventually try to find where I was. but I also know if I even told one single soul where I was, then the word would get around to everyone. I would want to just be there with nobody knowing so I could have peace of mind for once and not have to worry about someone trying to contact me. I just want silence. I just want to sit alone in the dark. I just want to not have to think. I just want my mind to be empty for once. i just want to be physically where I feel mentally.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgp2eu/only_one_reason_im_not_dead_yet/", "title": "only one reason I'm not dead yet.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "scrunzo", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635311148, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgp2eu/only_one_reason_im_not_dead_yet/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425436.7402792, "replies_charged": false}
