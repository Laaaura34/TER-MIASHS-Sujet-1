I was in my early 20s, and I was with this ....amazing person, but nothing worked out. SO I moved on, and I tried to start over many many times, but shit only got worse. Now? Now I'm a wreck; I don't want to go back, you can't go back, that's absurd, but I have nothing to offer anyone, not even myself, despite my ...'accomplishments'. I graduated with honors, I ran a mile in 05:30, and I traveled and saw and did, but I always felt like half my self was just ...gone.  I'm so bored and lonely, but I don't want friends. I'm sick, but noone cares; there's noone to care, not in any meaningful way, unless they're taking that sweet insurance money to make sure I'm 'stable' (read too doped up too cause trouble anymore)..heh, maybe you care, in your own way, but it doesn't ...I don't care either, if you do...I'm just done, that's all... I'm getting older, damnit, I don't have the energy for this shit. I don't want to start over, I don't want to love anymore. ...You know, at one point, I contacted that amazing person, years ago, something I really shouldn't have done. She had a whole family and kids, and that's just great. Just great. I hate myself. What did I expect? Ha, I'm pathetic. I had every opportunity, but I just couldn't believe it, couldn't make it mine, make it real. Not that I  regret anything, or think that I would have been better off, had things gone differently, but damnit, I was happy, and it just slipped away.  They say if you can find happiness once, you can do it again, but they're full shit. Sometimes you only get one chance. In fact, I would argue MOST times you only get one chance. I fucked it up. Now living with that is ...too much. Now I'm a marginalized, poverse, mentally ill shell of a man, who just wants to be left alone, who can't stop having flashbacks of his girlfriend begging him not to leave, of having his home invaded, or of being held hostage at gunpoint while his fellow humans demonstrated how shit humanity is...It's meaningless, but it means everything. My pain is nothing compared to some, but that doesn't mean I don't have to deal with it. I guess I'm not dealing...I'm posting to reddit. I deserve to die, my punishment is life itself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ljqeya/you_just_get_older_and_it_gets_harder/", "title": "You just get older, and it gets harder.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pffffffffffgggggyyyt", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 102, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613316585, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ljqeya/you_just_get_older_and_it_gets_harder/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428013.3511274, "replies_charged": false}
