I'm not going to describe in great detail, but I plan to die of my disorder within the next few days.\n\nThis seems rash and maybe it is, but I'm tired. For the past three years, I have been fighting an uphill battle with bulimia and bipolar disorder. It all started when I was raped by my cousin the first time. After that, whenever the family got together for holidays he would assault me again and again. Thanksgiving this past year was too much for me. He put me through the worst violence he has ever inflicted on me (he held me down and forced me to give him head while my active gag reflex made me vomit) and since then I have felt terrible. I've been in and out of inpatient for bulimia for the past six months and all my friends have stopped speaking to me. I have nobody in my life. I cannot bear to be around my family and all my former friends have left me. I've resulted to having random sex with strangers to give myself even the littlest bit of attention. I wish I didn't need attention so much, it makes me feel selfish and stupid. All my problems are really stupid things. I should grow up and deal with my issues like an adult. I'm a coward. But for once, I want to do something for myself. I am sick of feeling daily heart pangs, acid reflux, and light headedness (thanks to daily bulimia sessions). My front teeth are rotting and about to fall out. My weight drops every single day, my ribcage is disgusting, and no men see me as anything more than a quick fuck. The only thing that people want me for is sex and even then they don't want me, they want a vagina. \n\nAnyways, this is ranty and incoherent, but I just wanted to get it all off my chest.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7ikxyc/ive_lived_a_life_of_incest_and_bulimia_and_i_cant/", "title": "I've lived a life of incest and bulimia and I can't go on", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "whatsuedidnext", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1512797477, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7ikxyc/ive_lived_a_life_of_incest_and_bulimia_and_i_cant/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422925.5664568, "replies_charged": false}
