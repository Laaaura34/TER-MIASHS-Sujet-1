I wasn\u2019t sure what to do so I made a pact with one of my friends to commit suicide together, he was up for the idea because we wasn\u2019t as close then but as time as gone on we\u2019ve gotten really close and I have a feeling he wants to save me now, but it\u2019s past all of that. He still says that he would do it but he also makes up excuses and says that if he died of something natural then I\u2019m not allowed to kill myself because then I would be breaking the pact. The way he sees it is we either kill ourselves together or we die of natural causes or of a disease together. But I really don\u2019t know what to do now, any opinions?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i9ts79/please_read/", "title": "Please read \ud83d\ude36", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "roobs16", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597437405, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i9ts79/please_read/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427748.6307766, "replies_charged": false}
