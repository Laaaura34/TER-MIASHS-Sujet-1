I think to my self how peaceful it all would\u2019ve been if I had done it back then. I would\u2019ve saved myself from feeling all this pain and misery. \n\nThe intrusive thoughts are coming more often and stronger than before. I imagine how I could end it, I imagine the pain my death would cause to others but I also imagine the serenity my soul would experience if I could just do it.\n\nThen I wonder to myself if not today then maybe one day in the future? Will I go back to this moment like I\u2019m currently going back to that moment in middle school? \n\nIt\u2019s sad bc I live a pretty nice life, I have all that I need. Great friends, a lovely partner, financial stability, health and yet there\u2019s a deep hole inside me that is unsatisfied with this. It wants something more valuable, my own life. \n\nAnd I just wonder and play the scenario of the what if. I\u2019m tired, I need help. I\u2019ve told my mom before and no matter how much I beg, she won\u2019t have me on medications nor let me go see a psychologist and I don\u2019t have the money to pay for all that. I need help but I can\u2019t find any. I get closer and closer to walking with death to my final destination. I hate it here and yet I love a lot of parts of my life. But it doesn\u2019t feel enough to keep me living.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgru6c/i_wish_i_had_ended_it_all_when_it_all_started/", "title": "I wish I had ended it all when it all started", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Background-Mind-6715", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635323049, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgru6c/i_wish_i_had_ended_it_all_when_it_all_started/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635425196.3854513, "replies_charged": false}
