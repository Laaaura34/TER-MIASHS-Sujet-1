I didn't want my grief to exist on their servers for 30 days and be deleted.   \n\n\n Thank you for reading my email. I don't really want to talk to someone on the phone because my partner might hear and I don't want her to know. I also don't think I need this service as much as other people do so I don't want to waste your time on the telephone.  \n\n\nI don't know\u00a0who else to tell but for the last four days I have done nothing outside of work but lie on my side in the bed and imagine various ways of killing myself. I fantasize about making a noose and plan out places where I could hang myself. In some of those fantasies I leave just enough to chance that I am found and rescued, but the longer I sit and stare at my wall the more often my theoretical body is just left there and has gone quite cold and hopeless. Sometimes I imagine someone - anyone - doing something violent to me to kill me. Shooting or stabbing or pushing from a high place.Two days ago I tied a noose and sat for half an hour with it around my neck - not tied at the other end - just pushing my luck. In the end I took it off, untied it and hid it, because I was afraid my partner would come in and I would have to explain myself.  \n\n\nThat's the prevailing problem. I can't kill myself because I'm afraid to die. I can't self harm because I'm afraid of real pain. I find ways, of course - I bite myself, beat my head on the wall, slap myself as hard as I can as many times as I can in the same place. I could never draw blood, though. I couldn't do the real thing. I've sat there with a knife on my wrist daring myself to make it real and be a real self harmer instead of a pretender but my self\u00a0preservation kicked in and I put the knife down and just felt shivery. I think hanging myself would be easier than self harming. The first act of self harm would be extremely painful, but the first act of hanging myself would be a step forward. If I can just step into thin air then the rest of the equation solves itself, and I will be past the point of no return and it won't be my decision to make any more.  \n\n\nI don't know if that makes me a suicide risk. Maybe. I would have these thoughts every now and then but now I just sit and think about killing myself constantly. My other half comes in and kind of shuffles about the room and says 'come on' every now and then and I just lie still and will her to disappear until she does. I don't think she really wants me to be fixed. This all came about because I have come to terms with how worthless I am and I know I'm worthless to her. She talks to me harshly and gets irritated when I'm happy. When she is unhappy I comfort her and when I am unhappy she excuses herself from the picture. We haven't slept with each other in six months. Sometimes when I try to speak to her she is so rude back to me it feels like she's spitting on me. I can't do the same back because I'm not that type of person. It is very easy to sit here and write an email about how everyone around me is the villain and I'm the only real good one, about how I'm so virtuous and noble and everyone else is the cause of my problems. I am sure you hear that a lot though.\u00a0  \n\n\nI want to say that so you know I'm self aware when I say I want to be a good person and I want to make other people happy. I want to increase the net sum of happiness around me because I can't do it for myself. I don't want you to think those aspirations are trite or just easy-to-swallow slogans I've learned to tell myself. I work for a bank and I smile and laugh and joke with strangers who treat me like shit. I do it because every now and then I make one of them smile or they say 'thank you' and I can really tell by their expression that they meant it. I used to be a health care assistant and I worked exclusively in the elderly care wards because the people there were the most helpless. A man once tried to pay me because I helped him toilet when he couldn't help himself. I saw a woman die once who didn't know who she was any more and I had to help hold her still while the nurse helped her die and she defecated. There was no family there. The nurse opened the window after and said it was to\u00a0let the\u00a0soul out of the room but I expect it was because of the smell. I went home and cried and after a few weeks I stopped being an HCA because I couldn't take it. Then I joined the Alzheimers society instead. One day I had to stop my direct debit because money was tight. I took my Alzheimers Society badge off my work uniform because I felt like a fraud.  \n\n\nI'm just rambling now. I don't know how to help myself. I am a hypochondriac and live constantly in fear of the next big thing that will convince me I'm going to die, but today I'm sure that the only thing that's going to kill me is myself. I'm sorry.  \n\n\nPlease help. I don't want to kill myself. I paint models as a hobby and I haven't touched one in six days and I miss it terribly. When I think about them I just want to destroy them all because I know how much it will hurt me. Typing that last sentence was the first time I cried writing this email.
