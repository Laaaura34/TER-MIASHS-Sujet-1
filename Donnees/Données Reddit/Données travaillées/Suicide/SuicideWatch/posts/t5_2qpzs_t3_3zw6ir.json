I just sit and wait for things to break. When something isn't working, it's my fault, and the clock is ticking until the problem is fixed. I can't find a new career because I wouldn't be able to afford the costs of maintaining a family.\n\nMy marriage is to a woman who obviously wants polyandry, flirts constantly, and is more than likely fucking people on the side. If I confront her about this, I'm being paranoid and controlling. If I ignore it, I'm being passive and uncaring, and in a way I'm allowing it to happen to me. I can't divorce her because if I did I'd be a failure and the memories of her would kill me. My imagination of what she'd be doing without me in her way would ruin my psyche even more than it is today.\n\nMy children see me as a source of basic necessities and an enforcer of rules. They just want to be left alone to their own devices until they need something. I am bound to provide for them until they are of age, and then they'll probably forget about me entirely.\n\nMy friends don't really exist. I have a few people I speak with on a somewhat regular basis, some other people I drink with, and still others that are just online personas that sometimes like what I say. It seems like forever since I've had a real, deep, meaningful conversation with anyone. If I try to start one, it seems weird and inappropriate and... just depressing for all those involved.\n\nWhen my episodes hit, they hit hard and deep. It's as if I'm given crystal clear insight to how meaningless and painful my life really is. I can't afford to take care of my dental or physical or even mental issues, much less those of my family. When I ask for help, I'm met with a towering wall of despair and finger pointing. I just want to die.\n\nFor this reason, I've determined that the best course of action is to attempt therapy. Perhaps the therapist will validate all my concerns. Perhaps it's really true what I think. Maybe it will turn out that my wife is a brazen whore who is gobbling cock while I'm at work and my kids really do hate my guts and are just biding their time until they can escape. Maybe the world really will be a better place without me in it wasting precious resources while others are in need of my water, food, and air.\n\nThe part that really hurts me, if I can breathe enough to admit it, is that I was wrong. I was wrong to date my now wife. I was wrong to have kids. I was wrong to start my career. I was wrong to not kill myself earlier, when I didn't have responsibilities.\n\nI haven't determined the best way to end my life. \n\nMaybe this is just a call for help, and in a few weeks or months I'll feel better, right? But this pain, this yawning maw of despair has been with me for the better part of a decade. There are certainly moments that are enjoyable, sure. There are things that I'll miss, or miss out on. But if I had to choose between the utter hatred I have for myself and my life I've chosen against clean and sudden nothingness... well, I'd say the nothingness is far more calm and serene.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3zw6ir/pain_is_blinding/", "title": "Pain is blinding", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "toodaloo222", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1452183988, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3zw6ir/pain_is_blinding/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426350.299506, "replies_charged": false}
