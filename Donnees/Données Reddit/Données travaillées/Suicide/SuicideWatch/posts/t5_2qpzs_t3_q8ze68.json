My grandad passed in May (he raised me) and he was genuinely the only person who treated me like a human. I don\u2019t want to bad talk him but even at that he just done basics for me my entire life and i am greatful don\u2019t get me wrong. But ever since he has passed my aunt (16F) has taken over my entire life. Takes all the money i have, \u201cowns\u201d the house i live in and i just fucking hate it here. i get 20\u20ac a week and am expected to live off that as well as pay for electric. I\u2019m so miserable here. I get told i\u2019m a guest in this house???? i have lived here as long as everyone else. They all talk about me behind my back too. Saying all sorts of shit. from how filthy i am (i\u2019m not) to even how much food i eat? I don\u2019t know i was always thought that family is forever and \u201cblood is thicker than water\u201d but is it??? i cant stand it here. can\u2019t save up for a house because my money is being taken from me? They make me feel like i\u2019m the bad person? for what? trying to help? To top it off my boyfriends family don\u2019t like me. (so moving in there is not an option at all) which is causing issues for him i don\u2019t know. i feel like everything would just be solved if i was gone. every single day i just have this overwhelming anxiety and i don\u2019t know if i can handle it anymore. if i tried talking bout this with anyone they\u2019d just tell me i\u2019m being over dramatic. i don\u2019t know i\u2019m sick and tired of feeling this way and i am so fucking exhausted. i don\u2019t think i can do it anymore. No matter how hard i try everything just keeps crumbling.\n\n\n***EDIT*** so, now i am homeless.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q8ze68/im_tired/", "title": "i\u2019m tired.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Massive-Reserve-4693", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634338104, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q8ze68/im_tired/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426325.215053, "replies_charged": false}
