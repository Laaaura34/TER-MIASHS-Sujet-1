He will likely take/destroy/hide my things as punishment. \nThe only adults I trust are my teachers, ironically. But they\u2019re mandated reporters. They suggested a mental hospital but I\u2019ve been there so many times and it never helps. \nI don\u2019t need a time out after a serious traumatic event, I just\u2026 I just need to die. It\u2019s not a feeling of overwhelming pain as if something traumatic just happened. But a feeling of exhaustion and hopelessness after a string of traumas. \nJust a feeling of emptiness because I have nothing to live for. There\u2019s no reason to exist and nothing to hold me here. If I don\u2019t exist there\u2019s no pain to be felt. \nI\u2019ve tried everything I can. I\u2019ve gone back to school, I\u2019ve used the internet to meet others and find resources, I\u2019ve tried looking for groups to join and places to make friends. I\u2019m always alone. \nA hospital won\u2019t help. I\u2019m not in immediate danger. They\u2019ll just tell me what I already know and up my dose of meds. That doesn\u2019t change my life. \nA hotline won\u2019t do me good because they\u2019ll ask me to wake up my parents. The crisis text line just suggests coping skills and safety plans. I already know I shouldn\u2019t cut but it\u2019s the only thing that helps. It gives me dopamine and helps me sleep. \nI already know about meditation and breathing and meds and therapy\u2026 \nThat doesn\u2019t change the pain in my life.\nEvery day I\u2019m at school, my PTSD bombards me with horrible memories and intense feelings of fear.\nAt home, my parents fight and involve me in their petty games. They\u2019re emotionally abusive and neglectful. \nI don\u2019t have any friends to see or talk to. \nThe partners I had abused me and I\u2019m left with the trauma from that. I know therapy can help heal those things but. \nI\u2019ve been alone for so long. The pain has been here for so fucking long. I\u2019ve never been happy. I\u2019ve lived my entire life being abandoned and tortured.\nI just want out\u2026", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pjizb9/i_want_to_commit_suicide_i_have_everything_i_need/", "title": "I want to commit suicide.
