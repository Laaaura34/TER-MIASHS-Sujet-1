Your religion says that I will burn in hell for a. Not believing in your myths b. Being bisexual. For all of the shit you say about loving everyone you don\u2019t seem to be doing a lot of loving. I know gay people who converted and are now even more depressed because they\u2019ve been convinced to hate themselves. You cause\nSo much suffering with your hate, why can\u2019t you just leave us alone? you found something that makes you feel better and brings you comfort, I am legitimately happy for you, but why force your ideas on others? At homeless shelters you make people read your book. People do not care about your book and there are a lot more useful things they could be doing with that time. I don\u2019t know where im going with this but I\u2019d really appreciate if you guys could leave religion out if it when I\u2019m seeing help.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/phhm1w/preachers_can_kindly_fuck_off/", "title": "Preachers can kindly fuck off", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Remarkable-Search-81", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630716581, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/phhm1w/preachers_can_kindly_fuck_off/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426862.3804805, "replies_charged": false}
