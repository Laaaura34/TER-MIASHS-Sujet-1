Just graduated with a couple degrees, on my way to grad school in a few months. \"My future is bright\", they say.\n\nBut I have so many demons inside of me. I can't enjoy life and everything I achieve doesn't help alleviate the pain of knowing everything I don't have, or had and lost. I have no family in the country in which I am right now, and I haven't been with my family for several years. Even my family consists of just my parents, since i don't have any siblings. I am insanely jealous of people with good relations to their siblings, and I try to get make friends that can somehow fulfill that role. It never lasts.\n\nMy best friend, who I regarded as my sister (and she was aware and happy to fulfill this role for me), and I had a really bad falling out (think involving title 9 office etc.), and while there weren't any official allegations against me, it is clear that we can never go back to what we had previously. I never thought this relationship would be destroyed in such a manner.\n\nI have so many things happening in my life. I will be moving to a new place for grad school, I will have my own apartment, and none of these bring me any joy because I am fixated on the fallout. I don't want to feel like this, but the only way out seems to be to end it.\n\nI don't know where I am going with this post. I need help, but whenever I tried to follow a therapists advice, it made the situation worse. I guess I just need to kill myself, and it will solve all my problems, as well as everyone's problems with me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o3t2ii/i_dont_think_i_can_enjoy_life_ever_again/", "title": "I don't think I can enjoy life ever again.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway_i_am_lost", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624147161, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o3t2ii/i_dont_think_i_can_enjoy_life_ever_again/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428108.4792805, "replies_charged": false}
