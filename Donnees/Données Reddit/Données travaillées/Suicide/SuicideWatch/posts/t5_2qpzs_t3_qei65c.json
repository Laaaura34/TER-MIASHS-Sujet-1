However, I have no clue if she is single or not, because so far, she has never mentioned having a significant other. She also does not have an active social media, which makes it even harder to determine her relationship status. I also do not know if I am her type. This girl has supported my mental health when it declined to the point where I wanted to end my life. Basically, she is one of the main reasons why I haven't offed myself yet. However, I'm not sure if it will last. I wanna ask her out, but since I am not employed full-time after graduating and getting my Master's (I am still job searching), I cannot easily afford an expensive date. I feel like this may potentially be a deal-breaker in an adult relationship. I wanna be in a relationship with her before someone else takes that opportunity from right under me (if they haven't yet), but I feel like my current situation makes that goal improbable (if not impossible). I also worry that if I ask her out and I get rejected, I may risk losing my friendship with her as well as losing someone who has supported my mental health which will result in me becoming more suicidal. I don't know what to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qei65c/is_it_a_bad_thing_if_a_crush_that_i_have_is_the/", "title": "Is it a bad thing if a crush that I have is the main reason why I'm still going?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "No_Artist_5348", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635039067, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qei65c/is_it_a_bad_thing_if_a_crush_that_i_have_is_the/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427924.1617365, "replies_charged": false}
