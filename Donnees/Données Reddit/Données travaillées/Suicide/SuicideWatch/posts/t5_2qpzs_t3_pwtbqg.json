I just..hate myself. I can talk fine with people, be civil, kind, etc. I can function perfectly fine, but I just look around and I feel so unfulfilled. I can get the second-highest test score on an exam (which actually happened today) and I will only think about how I failed because I wasn\u2019t the best. I don\u2019t feel smart, I\u2019m not too sociable, I\u2019m not strong, I have no special hobbies I like or are good at. The only thing I thought could help me is eventually finding love, but I\u2019m giving up on that. The only thing I have left to value in myself is my education, and it\u2019s stressing me out so hard. Nothing is fun. Nothing feels good. I just don\u2019t care. I\u2019m too scared to actually kill myself, but I want to do it so, so bad. I don\u2019t know what else to do with my life, it feels pointless.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwtbqg/i_hate_myself_and_i_feel_like_i_will_never_find/", "title": "I hate myself, and I feel like I will never find love.
