No, I'm ridden with mental health problems and a condition certain to keep me alone for the rest of my life. Every day of my life is just constant melancholy and sadness. I want to die, I want to hang myself, or shoot myself anything is better than the amount of pain I'm feeling right now. I cant take it anymore. Everything always goes wrong for me or something always gets in my way. For 2019, all I wish for is death. I can't even think straight anymore, its just mush. The pain has broken me and it has broken any will I had left. I'm just a shell. I'm such an utter failure. I'm hideous. I'm deformed. I'm diseased. I don't even feel like I exist anymore due to so much pain. Sometimes, I want to pinch myself to see if I wake up from this awful nightmare. Maybe, I only deserve such things. I dont know anymore.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aauolm/im_so_tired/", "title": "Im so tired", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway018e7e51", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1546163403, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aauolm/im_so_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427572.2738829, "replies_charged": false}
