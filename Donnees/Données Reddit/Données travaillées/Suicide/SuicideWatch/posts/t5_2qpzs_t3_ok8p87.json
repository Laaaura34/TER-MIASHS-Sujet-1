When I asked that question it wasn't me feeling suicidal but just being generally interested but I can remember it very well being the first time I felt truly sad and extremely depressed and almost scared, the world completely changed. After a while, I forgot about it completely until I was 16 which is when my Mum & Dad sadly passed away shortly after one another, not related deaths and both were unexpected which made it more shocking. A few months after my Dad passed I was contemplating suicide, not because I was sad about them passing, I felt I got over it fairly quickly which may sound odd but instead because I couldn't quite wrap my head around the point of life.\n\nI came to the conclusion after endlessly looking into philosophy and general interest in the subject that life is inherently meaningless and in the end we will all die and eventually be forgotten which in itself is bleak and sad. There is of course the argument of there is absolutely no way of knowing the meaning of life, I agree I don't know but I feel at my core that it is completely well and truly meaningless and once we die, it's done, simply done and we won't even know it's over because there will be nothing.\n\nThis brings me to now, I go through periods of feeling better and then go through really dark, horrible periods such as the one I'm having now where I constantly think of ending my life, hurting myself and feeling extremely sad and angry at the fact, at least my fact that life is worthless which kills all joy, all motivation in my life for periods that can be months upon months and what makes me even more mad is that there are others that may not even think anything about life and are so much more happier and enjoying life more than me. I of course am not wanting everyone to suffer, but it just upsets me further that I can't seem to make myself think that way and simply relax and accept that fact and get on with it I guess.\n\nI am truly considering ending my life now as I can't seem to be happy, I do drag my family down as well as my girlfriend down, she has said to me if I can't change we will need to end our relationship as she doesn't want to be sad forever which is obvious and I don't blame her.\n\nI'm not sure what to do anymore, the constant existential thoughts are very intrusive and it isn't as simple as just 'stop thinking about it' as I know that's what most people will do, they simply don't think about life being meaningless and get on with their day but I CANNOT do that. I am thinking it may be best to speak to a therapist of some sort as there may be a problem with me deeper down?\n\nThanks if you have read this, I know it was a lengthy one.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ok8p87/existential_crisis_leasing_to_suicidal_ideation/", "title": "Existential crisis leasing to suicidal ideation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AnonymousAccount1408", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626282249, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ok8p87/existential_crisis_leasing_to_suicidal_ideation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426134.8793337, "replies_charged": false}
