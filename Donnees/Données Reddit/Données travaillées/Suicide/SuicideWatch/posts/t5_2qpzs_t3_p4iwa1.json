Her family, friends and cities all say \u2018atleast you have your boyfriend to look after you\u2019 and all the pressure is pinned on me. I\u2019ve been staying with her and I have to deal with the nasty, mean comments. The self harm, the threats, the suicidal comments. It\u2019s tearing me apart but I want to save her. I want to leave. I want to be there for her. I don\u2019t want to deal with this anymore. We\u2019re both 19, my life has come to a halt so I can look after her. I shouldn\u2019t be scared to shower or go to the toilet incase she runs away. I shouldn\u2019t be sick to my stomach when I hear the door unlock. It\u2019s a horrible way to live but I don\u2019t want her to die", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p4iwa1/gf_tried_to_kill_her_self_4_days_in_a_row_now_im/", "title": "Gf tried to kill her self 4 days in a row, now I\u2019m on 24/7 watch duty and my life is being ruined.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Exciting-Cat450", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1086, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628985139, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p4iwa1/gf_tried_to_kill_her_self_4_days_in_a_row_now_im/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425305.5474648, "replies_charged": false}
