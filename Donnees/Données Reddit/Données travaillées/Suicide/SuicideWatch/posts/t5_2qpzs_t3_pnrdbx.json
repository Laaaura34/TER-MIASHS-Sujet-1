I'm now newly sober again (I'm just over 30 days), and every day feels like I'm just getting up, getting through the day doing anything I can to just not get fucked up. It's exhausting.\n\nNext month I'm coming up on a year since I last tried to kill myself. A couple of days after I did so, a good friend's best friend did actually kill themselves. I feel guilty about that still, and it makes me just feel like it's time. I survived before, but for what? Just to come back to the same place?\n\nI'm trying to get my affairs in order now. Writing a letter, listing off the people who need to be notified. I have a literal village of people who care about and love me. I know I'm loved and I know it's going to hurt them so much because I've felt that hurt myself. I've seen what it does to communities and to people. It's just not enough to keep me from doing it now. It's unfair to ask me to keep doing this. I've had incredible times and amazing memories and times in my life when I felt alive and like I could do anything. It all comes back to this, though. I've been living on borrowed time for so long.\n\nThe worst part is I decided to order a lethal dose of a drug I used to abuse, so I can ease my passing, but ordering it has become difficult. It's a research chemical, but for whatever reason buying Bitcoin is almost impossible these days. I'm exploring alternatives because my plan is to inject, then go through with my primary method, and in the case that my primary method fails, the lethal injection should take care of it. I hope. I've spent so much time planning this and so many failed attempts. I just want it to be over this time around. I've never injected a drug before but I don't want to fuck this up. \n\nAnd before anyone suggests, I'm currently in outpatient rehab and doing NA meetings every day. I just can't do this. I was never meant to get sober. I was never meant for this world.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pnrdbx/addict_one_step_away_from_relapse_and_suicide/", "title": "Addict one step away from relapse and suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwfaraway23235434", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631577064, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pnrdbx/addict_one_step_away_from_relapse_and_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427443.2055056, "replies_charged": false}
