I never tell my parents about my thoughts because they gaslight me and never helped me with therapy. My bf at the time was away, my parents kept it between themselves. I just found out from my mother that my bf messaged my dad. It was weeks ago. I never want to break their hearts with telling them I am like this ( it is taboo in my family). I know my bf wants to help me, but I dont want to trust him anymore. He said he had a feeling I wanted to do it, thats why he texted my dad.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pnygyw/my_bf_messaged_my_dad_and_told_him_i_wanted_to/", "title": "my bf messaged my dad and told him I wanted to end myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Makesomeart25", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631606528, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pnygyw/my_bf_messaged_my_dad_and_told_him_i_wanted_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428426.9976847, "replies_charged": false}
