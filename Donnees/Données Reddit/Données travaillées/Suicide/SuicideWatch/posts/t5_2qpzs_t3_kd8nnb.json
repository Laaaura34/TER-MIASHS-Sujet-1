I don\u2019t feel like a human being. I\u2019m a moron who can\u2019t process simple information easily. Especially with responsibility on my back. I procrastinate until the end like the pathetic loser I am. It makes things worse now that im a senior about to graduate and I don\u2019t know what I want to do. Options are more limited because I\u2019ve been inept with mathematics my entire life. Just last year I became comfortable with adding, that\u2019s how pathetic I am. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me something\u2019s missing in my brain and it hurts not being able to articulate well enough for others to understand. It took me several days to just write this out because I didn\u2019t know how to convey my emotions because there\u2019s  too much information that I didn\u2019t know where to start. I give more than I have, sure being a friend is a job and you sign up for it when you reach out to someone. I only want comfort from certain people and that makes me feel like a scumbag; I guess it\u2019s because no one understands me except for 1 person. Even that person isn\u2019t as connected with me as I thought. I feel so alone, avenues are closing, doors are being locked and I\u2019m going to be left slowly bleeding with the freezing atmosphere holding my cold body. I just want to die and have everyone forget me because I know for a fact everyone will get over it within a day or two. I\u2019m too much of a coward to kill myself and I hate it, why can\u2019t I carry on with something for once in my life. I just want to have one person I can talk to, one person I can connect with emotionally, one person who will look at me and say I understand you and won\u2019t just blow me off acting as if I\u2019m lazy on purpose and depressed on purpose. \u201cYou put yourself down\u201d of course I fucking do, you don\u2019t know how it is to wake up everyday with dread on your mind and not being able to make progress on things that are important. You don\u2019t have a fucking clue how it feels like being restrained by your minuscule fucking brain. If anything I\u2019d rather have my life taken by something. Maybe I am being selfish and maybe I dint know what I wish upon myself, but look at all my inhibitions and tell me if I\u2019m worth living. There\u2019s a legion of people around, but not one person even understands. I say dream constantly because I\u2019d rather daydream than acquaint myself with reality. I\u2019m too tired to move on, I\u2019m sorry.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kd8nnb/why_cant_i_be_like_everyone_else/", "title": "Why can\u2019t I be like everyone else", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Any-Math-783", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 46, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607986321, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kd8nnb/why_cant_i_be_like_everyone_else/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426413.4735467, "replies_charged": false}
