One day, the question arose from one of the students who asked who at the table liked her and considered her a friend. Almost everyone at our table rose their hand. Seconds later, I asked the same question. No one raised their hand. They looked at me in silence. Some of them gave smug looks as if to say \u201cWow, why did you ask that? You already know the answer.\u201d It hurt. I asked the teacher the next day to move me to a different table. I sat at a half empty table far away from my classmates.\n\nThe same year in middle school, I was trying to make friends with people in my study hall. One girl flat out told me \u201cShut up. Because no one cares.\u201d I stopped trying to talk to new people. I just seem to annoy everyone. I don\u2019t even have to open my mouth, and already people hate me. I can\u2019t tell anyone how I feel. They\u2019ll tell me to shut up. They\u2019ll tell me that no one cares. They\u2019ll just look at me with a smug look for expecting anyone to care about me or like me. I keep thinking about these memories and I keep replaying them day after day. It\u2019s like I\u2019m there all over again, being hated or told off. My heart is always hurting at these memories.\n\n\nThese people have probably forgotten about me. But I haven\u2019t forgotten them. If they were in front of me, I\u2019d apologize. And tell them they were right, and had the right idea all along. I\u2019m annoying and unliked, and I\u2019m better off dead.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ejty9h/i_let_two_bad_experiences_drive_me_to_this_point/", "title": "I let two bad experiences drive me to this point.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "WertlosundUnordung", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1578125463, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ejty9h/i_let_two_bad_experiences_drive_me_to_this_point/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426645.2964604, "replies_charged": false}
