No matter what I do (meds, therapy, dbt, exercise) I just end up back planning my death. Two failed attempts last year that left me in comas for days. I'm so low tonight. I don't want to be in a coma, I want to be dead.\n\nEdit: and with the light of day I've pulled through and planning has eased for now.
