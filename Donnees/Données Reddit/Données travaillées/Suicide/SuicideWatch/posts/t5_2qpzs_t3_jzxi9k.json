In the last year it's gotten worse as in April my girlfriend of three years broke up with me. She didn't really do much to help me with my body image. Covid lockdown is making me crazy. I don't even know what a friend is anymore. I don't feel like I have any real connection with anyone. I feel so disgusting and vile. I hate myself so much. I've tried to kill myself three times this year but of course last minute you think about something stupid that psychs you out. I wish someone would kill me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jzxi9k/male_with_body_dysmorphia/", "title": "Male with body dysmorphia", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Strange_Tackle", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606189652, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jzxi9k/male_with_body_dysmorphia/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422935.9044125, "replies_charged": false}
