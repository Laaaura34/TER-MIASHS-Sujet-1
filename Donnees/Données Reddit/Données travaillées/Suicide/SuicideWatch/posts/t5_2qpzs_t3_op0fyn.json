My whole life is kinda shitty, alcohol, coke, ketamine, sleeping pills etc are the only things that make living bearable. \n\nJust like the title says: the only thing that keeps me from killing myself is the guilt that others will feel after I die. That\u2019s it, I\u2019m blackmailed by my own guilt and it\u2019s a fucking rancid reason to be alive.  \n\nSomeone try to give me reason better than guilt. I live hundreds of miles away from any family and my best friend killed herself when we\u2019re 18, if you can try to give me a reason  or even reason with me I\u2019d appreciate it. I\u2019m sick of living my life in guilt, this is not a way to live.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/op0fyn/the_only_thing_that_keeps_me_alive_is_guilt/", "title": "The only thing that keeps me alive is guilt\u2026", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KT_123456789", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626905883, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/op0fyn/the_only_thing_that_keeps_me_alive_is_guilt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426182.3857653, "replies_charged": false}
