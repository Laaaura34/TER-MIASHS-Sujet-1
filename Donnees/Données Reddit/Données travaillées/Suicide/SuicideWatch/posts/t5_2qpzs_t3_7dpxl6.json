All my life i've just been a passive observer of life, never really getting involved and never taking \"action\" so to speak. I never cultivated any hobbies interests or talents, I dont have any friends. I just did the work that was required of me (memorizing concepts) and now I have a hollow empty existence. I'm not sure what I should be doing at any moment, I cant make any decisions. I dont know how to be a person who just goes about their day, doing things and saying things because literally nothing is in my head. My whole life has just been school work and then aimlessly surfing the internet, and now I feel like I'm screwed for life. How do I cultivate a personality when I haven't done anything with my life but I'm too afraid to do anything or know where to turn to? I literally copied this guy's personality and viewpoints sophomore year of college because it was something to be other than my boring self who is paralyzed by indecision, but i regret it immensely. How would I ever have another friendship or relationship when I have nothing to say? I have no goals or long term dreams. I'm paralyzed. Suicide seems like my only option, I wasted my life.
