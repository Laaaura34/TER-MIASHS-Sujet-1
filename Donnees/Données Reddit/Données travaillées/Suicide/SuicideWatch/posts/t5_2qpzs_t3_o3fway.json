I\u2019m falling back to the person I fought so hard not be anymore. For f**** sake I\u2019m drinking at 9AM . I\u2019m done . I accomplished this feeling and did so many great things and now I\u2019m back here hating myself and everything I do . I\u2019m not good enough. I do not deserve anyone or my own life . So many people I feel like didn\u2019t deserve to die but my useless self is still here . I feel like I\u2019m only still here because of my 7 month year old son . It\u2019s so hard man it\u2019s so hard . I called the suicidal line and it literally was a buzz kill , they didn\u2019t even answer .", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o3fway/failure/", "title": "Failure", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "weirldlilthang", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624108594, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o3fway/failure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426971.2507863, "replies_charged": false}
