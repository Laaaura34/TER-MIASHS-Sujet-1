I just don't want to always be barraded by family that sees my successes as not good enough.\n\nWhat if I overdose just bad enough to get sent to the psych ward? To show them that things are not ok with how they are right now. I was there in January because I was genuinely very suicidal. My mom and older sister got scared. They at least tried to be better. But now, they keep pressuring me to feel like I'm not doing the right things.\n\nReally considering overdosing just enough to go to the hospital. Not to die. Idk.
