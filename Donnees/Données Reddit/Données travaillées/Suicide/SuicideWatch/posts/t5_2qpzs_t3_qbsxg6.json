I\u2019ve had anxiety since I was very young and it\u2019s basically all I can remember about anything in my childhood. The fear of failure my father drilled into me. I was burnt out by 13 I would not take showers , binge eat, watch shows in my disgusting ass room all day, literally mastrubation was my only source of happiness. Since then I haven\u2019t been able to get rid of my depression. Last year I was the happiest I\u2019ve ever been , I was managing some how until I lost all of my friends and was severely bullied at school emotionally and physically, I had an older boyfriend who got me into some pretty traumatic acid trips to \u201cmake me feel better\u201d after that and it really all went downhill from there I couldn\u2019t show up to school I hated myself so much I failed my junior year and somehow made it to senior year this year where I\u2019ve moved to a new school not even any better I can\u2019t make any friends because I\u2019ve lost all parts of my personality I don\u2019t even know who I am anymore. I\u2019m exhausted, I hate myself, I\u2019m back in the same boat of depression so desperate to just fucking get out for good but it feels like it will never happen. I\u2019m so exhausted. Like even physically I can\u2019t do anything I procrastinate any work I stay in bed and feel sorry for myself and all my parents have to say is that I\u2019m fucking lazy and the real world is going to hit me soon and it just sucks because they haven\u2019t noticed anything at all. They haven\u2019t noticed how skinny I\u2019ve gotten or how I don\u2019t laugh anymore or how wrong it is that I\u2019m in my bedroom in bed sleeping every day all day and all I do is feel guilty about it because they make me feel worthless. It scares me because I don\u2019t want to die but it seems like more and more the thoughts keep coming that it would just be so easy because I don\u2019t care about the future I don\u2019t care about anything and I\u2019m just scared because I\u2019m so alone I just hate myself so much", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbsxg6/im_so_depressed_i_have_no_idea_what_to_do_anymore/", "title": "I\u2019m so depressed I have no idea what to do anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "444Infinity_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634704330, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbsxg6/im_so_depressed_i_have_no_idea_what_to_do_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422891.592388, "replies_charged": false}
