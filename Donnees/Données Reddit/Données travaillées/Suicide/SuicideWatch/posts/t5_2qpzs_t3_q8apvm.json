If it is it'd be great if anyone knows where I could find the appropriate subreddit. \n\nMy father attempted suicide about three years ago. As a result he lost his job and is now an amputee. He also has borderline personality disorder. It can be difficult knowing how to communicate with him. I have yet to master it. After many years of tension and conflict in the house, my twin sister felt she had to get away and moved to Arizona. My mom and I moved in with my grandmother. My mom has done everything she possibly could to stay. But the damage has been irreparable. To me they haven't been much of a couple since even before my dad's attempt. Recently she's filed for divorce. Before filing, she knew she had to learn not to hold herself responsible for what may follow. I thought I had learned to accept what might happen too. It has felt inevitable for a long time. I got a voice-mail from my dad today and went to the house to talk to him. I found his suicide note in the printer. It appears he was planning to go through with it a few days ago. I alerted my mother. My dad is at work, he just started a new job. Now I'm not sure what I'm going to say to him. Based on what was said in the note, I know I wasn't supposed to find it - yet.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q8apvm/i_just_found_my_dads_suicide_note/", "title": "I just found my dad's suicide note", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Short_Sea_7957", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 37, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634252102, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q8apvm/i_just_found_my_dads_suicide_note/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635421094.216034, "replies_charged": false}
