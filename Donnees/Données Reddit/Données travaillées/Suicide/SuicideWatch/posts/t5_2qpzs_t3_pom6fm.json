I am posting this mostly for myself and don't have any expectations out of life anymore.\n\nI've been made fun of my entire life. I have a very mild case of Aspergers but it's just enough people tend to realize somethings a little off after meeting me a few dozen times, so I never could keep friends long term.\n\nAs a kid, I was made fun of so bad I started refusing to go to school and the school even held an assembly to try to prevent people from bullying me further without asking permission from my parents or me. Of course, that just made them do it more and I became a complete joke to the kids. I started threatened violence on the kids because I was a young scared child who just wanted to be left alone. This actually worked until the school was notified that I was potentially a danger to other kids. Of course, this didn't go over well and the state required I spent a year in a behavoral correction facility as a result. Funny thing, I felt like everyone else needed the help, not me. I wasn't the one bullying, I was the product of excessive bullying. Therapy and \"help\" only made it much worse and warped into my mind that no one will ever like me because I was \"different\". After juvi, I dropped out and left home. I felt betrayed by my parents and everyone in my life. I just wanted to be alone. My dad shot himself shortly after I left. I was 16-17 at the time.\n\nI was able to get on disability because of my mental health records and as a result I stayed home playing world of warcraft for over a decade. I probably left my house 6 times in 10 years. Online friends were easier to keep, and that's what kept me going for awhile. However, I gained so much weight playing games 16 hours a day and had health problems at the young age of 29.\n\nWhen I turned 30, I realized I hated my life. I was really lonely. I had never even held a girl's hand. I really wanted to die. So instead of just killing myself I did the opposite, and decided \"Enough pity. I'm an adult now. Work on myself and good things will come!\". I threw out all the junk food and started eating healthy. I got rid of my computer and all gaming devices, forcing me to go outside. Over the next year, I lost 120 pounds. I bought a road bike and got very competitive with the sport, my longest bike race being 136 miles and I have even biked across entire states.\n\nI decided to push myself even further, I set a new goal to do an iron man and started running and swimming too. I almost achieved this goal after 4 years of intense work. I completed a half iron man with relative ease (64mi bike, 13mi run, 2mi swim, back to back without breaks). A feat most people can't even dream of... But I wasn't happy and felt like I had no real purpose, leading to me slowly burning out.\n\nSo I decided to get off disability and get a real job. Which I did and I quickly climbed to a manager position and started making 6 digits despite not even finishing high school. Making money was no problem for me, being an excellent worker was easy with the amount of discipline I learned training for an iron man the last 4 years. However, having money did not make me any happier. I bought a nice house, a brand new Tesla, I spent $75k on a custom built home theater. More money than I knew how to spend. The dream right? Hate to break it to you but this type of stuff doesn't make you happier. It's a temporary bandaid at best. Your mind quickly adapts to $500/month or $50,000/month. This is when I realized, money is absolutely useless outside of survivability. Now I feel like almost everyone in western culture is chasing something meaningless.\n\nAt this point I knew deep down my depression was coming from loneliness and lack of a soulmate. That's all I ever really wanted, but if people don't like me, if girls won't date me, then what else could I do at this point? I'm handsome according to people who are briefly in my life. I'm 6'2, which is apparently important to girls? I'm healthy and not overweight. I look 10 years younger than I am. I'm apparently in the top 2% for income. In my head I keep thinking \"how can I have all this and people still don't like me? I must be the worse person in the world...\"\n\nI decided to test who my true friends were and decided not to post or message/call anyone on social media unless they messaged me first. Two months passed and I had not been sent even one single message. Not even by my \"best friend\". It has now been 8 months and my \"best friend\" and I haven't spoke. I called him the other day just to be like \"dude what you been up too?\" and he didn't even bother to answer or call back. I'm a completely forgettable person.\n\nWhen I ask girls to hang out, they always say yes, but then they ghost me before we meet back up. Everytime. I've had girls confirm plans 30 minutes prior and still not show up. I don't understand. I've actually sent entire convos to people asking \"WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?!\" and no one has given me advice other than \"she's pretty young, try girls a little older\". Even if I actually found a girl that did want to hang out... I'm a 35yo virgin and I've only had 3 kisses, all 3 hammered at a bar. I feel VERY uncomfortable attempting to date women my age because of the insane experience gap. I imagine it's the same feeling a young teen would feel in a sexual encounter with a much older person. Not pleasant. I don't think there's any hope for me in this department. \n\nSo I gave up on the whole soulmate thing, and ended up just getting a dog in hopes it would fill my loneliness. That worked great for a year, but then the need for human companionship came back. I've been taking him to the dog park every day and working on my social skills at the same time, but it's more or less the same. People are drama and hypracrits. Always talking shit about everyone behind their backs and trying to cause problems. I've just grown to hate people. I can't trust anyone anymore cause I see back stabbing happening all the time.\n\nToday, was the straw that broke the camel's back. Despite me not having any issues with my dog for over a year of daily park visits, today my dog \"attacked\" another dog. Well, he defended his personal space after a giant 100 pound puppy was ignoring the numberous warnings my dog gave him over the past week to \"back the fuck off, I don't want to play with you.\". My dog weighs only 42 pounds for reference. There was no blood and no marks. His dog didn't even yip. It was like 6 seconds of my dog chasing his dog off to scare him away by growling and snapping at his fur. Afterwards, the owner started yelling at me and telling me \"we about to have a serious problem bro, if your dog touches mine again\" then to my disbelief 3 people at the dog park, who I thought were my \"dog park friends\", who I've known for a good year, sided with this stranger and his massive 100 pound puppy that is far too young to even be there. They basically told me \"it's not the first time my dog has chased another dog and that my dog is aggressive/I should leave\". Every single one of these people's dogs have gotten into atleast one fight with another dog, one of which even had cops called on her dog last week! Once again, I felt singled out and betrayed by people who claimed to be my friends. Especially when I defended them when their dogs got in fights. When I was in the parking lot leaving, the 100 pound puppy jumped on a tiny 10-12 pound elderly dog who screamed in pain as the owner attempted to hold him back. So I yelled out \"yeah, it's MY dog that's the problem, obviously you all are dumb fucks\". Childish, yes, but I was pissed. My dog doesn't even attack squirrels and mice. His best friend is a kitten. He loves kids. He is well trained and no threat.\n\nSo now the highlight of my day, relaxing in the park with my dog after work, is history. As sad as it is, I literally have NOTHING left to look forward to. What's the point anymore? I have nothing to do, no one to hang out with, no where to go.\n\nIf you are somehow still reading this, thanks. I tried so fucking hard and kept trying. I kept going and went above and beyond, when most would have given up before I did. But I finally reached my limit and I give up. There's nothing for me here. There is no joy in this world for me and I truly believe no one can understand me as a person. I called my boss today and quit, I will be selling my house for whatever offer I can get by the end of this month, and then I will go travel the world with my one true friend, my dog. Hopefully I can give him the best life possible since he's the only thing that cares about me anyway.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pom6fm/i_changed_my_whole_life_after_hitting_rock_bottom/", "title": "I changed my whole life after hitting rock bottom, rised to the top, and it only made me hate people and my life more.
