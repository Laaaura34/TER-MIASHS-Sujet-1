Then, I get more and more depressed until just beforehand and I think to myself \"I've finally worked up the right combination of despair and courage to finally fucking end it when the date arrives.\" But by the time it does I start feeling *just* a little bit better and get too scared to pull the trigger. I've been like this for 5 years already. I can't take any more but I can't go through with it either. It's torture. Why can't I just die in my sleep or something?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bmpyzp/i_live_my_life_from_suicide_crisis_to_suicide/", "title": "I live my life from suicide crisis to suicide crisis.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dannymason", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 36, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1557439381, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bmpyzp/i_live_my_life_from_suicide_crisis_to_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426127.2041097, "replies_charged": false}
