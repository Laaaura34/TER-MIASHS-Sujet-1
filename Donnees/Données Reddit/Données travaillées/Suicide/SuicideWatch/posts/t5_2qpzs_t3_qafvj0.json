My roommate found me in the bathtub drunk and covered in blood. I was taken to the hospital, but nothing was bad enough and I was coherent enough that they just sent me home. No hospitalization, no grippy sock jail, nothing. They recommended outpatient treatment, which is only happening via zoom call because of the pandemic.\n\nI wish so desperately that I wouldn't have been found. I wish I would have drank more, drank faster, cut deeper, taken more drugs, anything. All I am now is a burden to my roommate. She feels like she has to care for me because I'm such a fragile little fucking thing. And I am. I would be right back at it if it wasn't for her.\n\nI can't stand the thought of fighting to get better. Of fighting to find a real therapist. Fighting through this asinine group therapy call every day for 6 hours. Fighting to put on a smile and go back to work, because I still need to fucking pay bills unfortunately. Fighting to just live is so fucking exhausting and I want to die even more than I did 5 days ago.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qafvj0/i_tried_to_kill_myself_5_days_ago_and_i_regret/", "title": "I tried to kill myself 5 days ago and I regret not doing a better job.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lzrdmnd", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634533589, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qafvj0/i_tried_to_kill_myself_5_days_ago_and_i_regret/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425321.1046035, "replies_charged": false}
