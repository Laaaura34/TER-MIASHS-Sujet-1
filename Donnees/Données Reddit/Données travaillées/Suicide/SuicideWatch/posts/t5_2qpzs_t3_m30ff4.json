Lately though, I\u2019ve experienced it in a different form. Usually when I wanted to die, it was because I hated myself and my life and didn\u2019t imagine it could get any better. Living was just so painful and I needed it to stop. I didn\u2019t have the luxury of taking time off, there was always work to be done and no other way out, and no one cared. This time, it\u2019s less pain (although sometimes it is) and more of an extreme sense of contentment. I honestly feel like I\u2019ve lived enough, I don\u2019t need to live anymore. The world is so beautiful, but I don\u2019t need to stay any longer. I\u2019ve lived, loved, cried, felt joy, felt pain. I\u2019m young but I\u2019ve already seen so much. The best way I can describe it is when you\u2019ve had a good time at a party, but you\u2019re getting tired and decide it\u2019s time to leave. You may be having a good time, but you know you should go home and call it a night. Honestly though I haven\u2019t even enjoyed life lately at all. But that\u2019s kind of how it feels. I love life, I had a good run, but I\u2019m ready to leave.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m30ff4/suicidal_ideation_but_a_different_perspective/", "title": "Suicidal ideation but a different perspective", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "madsmj_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615495861, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m30ff4/suicidal_ideation_but_a_different_perspective/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427280.172663, "replies_charged": false}
