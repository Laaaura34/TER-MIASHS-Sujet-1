Tonight I\u2019m thinking about the peace of mind that must exist somewhere else and how I could get there. I\u2019ve never been able to find here on this earth and I\u2019ve been alive for 24 years now. I\u2019m ready to go find it. The way everything has fallen apart and continues to fall apart makes me feel like my purpose is not here but somewhere else. I feel like someone dropped me off on earth by accident. But how do I get to where I\u2019m supposed to be? There\u2019s something disabling me, paralyzing me, keeping me from moving forward and I just can\u2019t figure out what it is. My mind is fixated on everything other than what it should be. I just suck at life, I can\u2019t get it right. What is the easiest way to go? How can I peacefully leave\u2026 I don\u2019t want to feel the pain I feel it so intensely everyday I don\u2019t want my last moments to be that too.
