Being alive has become very burdensome and agonizing. I am tired of living in a constant cycle of melancholy. I am a burden to the people around me and myself. I constantly feel irritated or empty like a void or overwhelmingly depressed/sad. The only thing keeping me from doing it is my religion. I feel like my time is up here, and this is so hard to explain because i am so young and haven\u2019t experienced much. I don\u2019t believe it will get better nor do i want it to anymore. I just need it all to end. I want to rest so badly. I don\u2019t want to do anything in this life that i never asked for. I never wanted to be here. Even the things I enjoy don\u2019t genuinely make me happy. I don\u2019t care about anything and I am tired of feeling forced to be alive. Tired of trying to be happy and bettering myself and working hard. All of that for what? It feels like I am dying internally while I am still alive. I hope I come to die physically as well soon.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/iv8vto/i_wish_i_never_existed/", "title": "I wish I never existed.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cypherclouds27", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 38, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1600445069, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/iv8vto/i_wish_i_never_existed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427517.9966037, "replies_charged": false}
