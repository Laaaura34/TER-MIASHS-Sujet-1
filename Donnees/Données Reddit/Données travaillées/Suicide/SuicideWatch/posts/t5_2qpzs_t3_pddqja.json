I can't help it it's almost taking control of me now Everytime someone does the bare minimum of saying Hello or saying something negative in some way. \nI want to make someone die so their family mourns them, make them feel pity for that person but in the end He/She/They we're probably just as suicidal as everyone else and I did them a favor. \nWhen I was little I used to hurt my family when they'd pass by, slapping them or punching them, they'd always make jokes \"oh he's gonna be a murderer one day\" I don't want it becoming a reality but it's getting Bad. \nBut I'm Not in a good place myself, maybe it's Me who wants to die honesty I don't know, maybe in the end I'm being an edgy teenager and it'll pass.
