This upset me as, a few months ago, they talked me away from my suicidal thoughts and suggested we enter a no-suicide pact.\n\nYesterday, I reached out to them because they suggested that they were feeling suicidal in a post on social media. I suggested we talk it about it. I asked when they would be available to talk. They continued texting me and making social media post as normal. I texted them again and asked how they were doing. They continued to act normally. I stopped trying and hoped they were fine. It was clear they didn\u2019t want to talk it out.\n\nFlash forward to this morning, they admitted to carrying out a \u201csemi-suicide attempt\u201d. I got mad. I texted them to remind them about our pact and stated that since it didn\u2019t do anything, I was considering it null and void.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be an asshole, but when I thought about killing myself, I always thought about how that wouldn\u2019t be honoring my friend and I\u2019s agreement. I feel a bit cheated and useless. I\u2019m not sure if I have a right to feel anything. I just do. \n\nDo I have the right to be mad? How can I not make things any worse?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/inlwuo/my_friend_broke_our_antisuicide_pact_do_i_have/", "title": "My friend broke our anti-suicide pact.
