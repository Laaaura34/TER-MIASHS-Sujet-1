I literally tried everything meds, getting lots of people around me, being more close with my family, working on myself, being positive I even have a gf now but nothing changes I still feel the same as always. I hate people a lot i see someone with money I just get mad I see someone have a good relationship or just hooking up I get mad and feel pain in my chest even tho I actually have a gf that actually cares about me.\nI hate the way I am I just hopped I'd feel even worse that I wouldn't actually care about the people around me to kms", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbg6t4/jealous_of_others/", "title": "Jealous of others", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ichiiii_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634663936, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbg6t4/jealous_of_others/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426846.3112664, "replies_charged": false}
