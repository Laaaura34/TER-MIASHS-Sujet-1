It reminds me of the jungle, the rain, old games with 8-bit soundtracks, and being in freezing cold band halls anxiously waiting to audition. The only thing I don\u2019t really understand is why. Why do I feel like this? Why am I so attached to an instrument that has only ever felt weird to play. The only reason I ever played marimba was to get attention from my parents because my older brother had done so well and literally got in the newspaper because of it. Freshman goes to state for music on the first try. Everyone knew my brother and sister and they would shove it in my face. That\u2019s why I played marimba, because it seems like everything I do, no matter what that thing is, I end up fifteen steps behind my older brother.\n\nMy siblings are all absolutely amazing. My oldest sister got the national merit scholarship and is now a successful business-woman connected to her African roots, now with 4 beautiful children, my second oldest sister got into Rice and excelled at all art and science, my brother did the same stuff except went into the opposite direction as far as core classes went. My three little siblings, while all still in middle school, are the epitome of academic excellence. And then there\u2019s me. I am in the pit of all pits. \u201cSo much wasted opportunity\u201d \u201ctoo late\u201d \u201cmissing chances\u201d \u201cnot good enough\u201d. Everyone has begun to speak of me like I\u2019m some joke. Some huge mistake. I laugh with them, but on the inside, I\u2019m slowly crumbling like some fucking dead plant.\n\nPeople tell me to stop comparing myself to others then immediately do just that. I cut myself because it was a temporary release for my emotions and instead of my family offering me help, they just got mad. More disappointment. More stress. Why is it that I have to cut myself for them to hear me, to see me? I tried killing myself about a month or two ago because I felt so bad. Being known as the disgrace of the family all because of my grades. My father told me that he thought I was the smartest out of all of his kids, but I was wasting that exponentially by not doing my work. Even now, I\u2019m supposed to be working but no. I\u2019m sitting in my bed whilst listening to Tchaikovsky and Chopin (whom I hate right now, as his piano pieces are too hard and fast, or the complete opposite and slow/ easy which upsets me to great lengths). Anyways, the obvious solution to this would be staying on task and finding my own thing that I like, but in the process of copying my elder siblings, I have essentially become a watered down version of them. Like a dollar tree version. All the same interests, none of the talents. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019m so stressed out that I can\u2019t focus. I always have to have something in my hands or I freak out (ex: I can\u2019t walk in the hallway without a heavily beaded bracelet or an ID because then I focus on either too little or too much) and I don\u2019t sleep nearly as much anymore. I\u2019ve become a slight germaphobe (not letting people sit on my bed or touch me or my food in any way and vise versa), I get 5 hours of sleep each night tops, accompanied by sleep paralysis. I eat once or twice a day, and I\u2019m always extremely tired with random bursts of energy like 3 times a day which I\u2019m starting to believe are manic episodes, but I haven\u2019t been formally diagnosed with anything so I can\u2019t say for sure. I have xenomelia in my left leg, and I can\u2019t even explain why.  THAT accompanied by my mother saying that I should get a fresh start and switch over to another school is absolutely tearing me apart. Why? Back to the band thing.\n\nI have a very weird attachment to the band and everything that comes with it. But how could I possibly stay at my current high school if I feel incredibly wrong here? What am I supposed to do when I have a heap of expectations from everybody and I can\u2019t do anything to stop them. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in a never-ending loop of unhappiness that\u2019s all seemingly my doing. What accomplishments do I have? What have I done besides making my father stressed out beyond belief (he told me he was depressed because of me) and my mother getting so angry at me that even my little siblings get punished for something that I did? \u201cYou can play the piano, you can make art, you can-\u201d and that\u2019s when I stop people. Yes. I can in fact play various instruments, and draw on occasion, but none of that is good enough to take me anywhere.\n\nI live a life of hobbies and mellifluous pastimes, and when I put them together, the puzzle pieces don\u2019t fit. The world reciprocates in some ways, and in other ways, it does absolutely nothing, because the world moves on while I sit in this black sap that is my grades, expectations, and social life. I often look at this quote - \u201cA star died to make you and you find no romance in that\u201d. It makes me question things quite a bit. It\u2019s weird to think about. At first, it might make you feel special. \u201cA star died to make me? Wow!\u201d, but then you may realize that stars died to make everyone. The quote is supposed to make you feel significant, special, but then you realize that everyone around was also created from stars just as you were. It plays in uniqueness. Adults tell you all the time that there\u2019s only one of you, nobody else is like you, and that you are a unique individual capable of whatever you can possibly put your mind to in whatever moment it is. That\u2019s true. You are unique, and you are capable of doing whatever your heart desires if you try hard enough. With the right intentions and planned calculations, anything is possible. The thing that\u2019s wrong with that is that it applies to everyone. The fact that everyone is unique simultaneously makes everyone the exact opposite of that. We are all, at heart, the same. Look around yourself next time you\u2019re in public. Everyone has a life. Everyone has their own story.  The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you, the opposite applies. Almost everyone on this Earth has had their own dreams and ambitions at some point.\n\nIf you are capable of thought, you are capable of desire whether that be world domination or growing a garden in your 5 by 5-foot backyard. When you multiply each person on earth having desires, multiple ones at that, ones that vary in size and difficulty, that\u2019s almost 8 billion dreams and that\u2019s assuming that people on earth only have one dream. Your goal in life is probably the exact same goal that someone else has on the other side of the world. Your dreams are probably being pursued by hundreds of thousands of other people, and that\u2019s including the psychopaths. While not all people with the desire to torture and kill people pursue their dream, there are a lot more people out there with secret homicidal thoughts than many of you would be comfortable thinking about. Back to what I was talking about before though, this false sense of individuality and uniqueness that has been instilled in us since the beginning of our childhood really makes all of us feel important at times, but you have to remember, we\u2019re all in this together. We all have to coexist with each other for the rest of our lives in one way or another whether we want to or not. We need more than food water and shelter to survive. We also need other people. People that are here guide and help us, show us right from wrong, and pass on their knowledge to us so that we don\u2019t end up completely messed up and torn apart as if we\u2019re not human.\n\nI feel as if the people who were supposed to guide me to these places, my parents, my siblings, and my friends haven\u2019t all been the best influences on me. I compare my family to other families quite often. Families where their parents treat them like friends instead of trophy objects to show off on Facebook and Instagram. Parents that tell them \"Good job! I'm so proud of you!\" on their report cards instead of asking them if they think they can get into college with their lowest grade being an 86. I think I would cry if my parents said that they\u2019re proud of me, even once. All that I want is some sort of sign from them that I\u2019m doing okay as some form of self-validation so that I can feel like I\u2019m not working my ass off for nothing. It\u2019s small things that other people take for granted.\n\nI give other people my heart and my soul because of my parents. I give other people what my parents never give me. I try to be as genuine as possible and give constructive criticism on everything that people ask me about so that they can get the feeling that I have been yearning for the past 10 years of my life. Acceptance. Everyone around me is so focused on their own lives and passions that they seem to ignore me. Not to say that I want to be the center of everyone's attention, I would just like to be acknowledged. Just once. One sentence from anybody I know, absolutely anyone, that\u2019ll keep me pushing forward. My suicidal ideations have once again reappeared. Maybe this entire thing is shit, as I\u2019m just a junior in high school who isn\u2019t capable of thinking for myself apparently, but if you got this far thank you for reading. It\u2019s nice to know that someone, anyone, listened at all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qg9fba/whats_the_point_anymore/", "title": "What's the point anymore?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "xenogenesisXVII", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635263556, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qg9fba/whats_the_point_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425189.632728, "replies_charged": false}
