We were on a plattform and joking about jumping. Then i had the urge to throw myself of said plattform. The only reason i didn't jump was because i didn't want to scar my classmates. The second time was in a camp. There was this tall building with a spiral staircase, but the middle was open so you could see all the way down. It was disco night when i snuk out and went there. I stood on the railing on the top floor for like 5 minutes just looking down. But it wasn't high enough so it probably wouldn't have killed me. So i stepped down. That was 2 months ago. Now i looked up how to kill myself with meds so i could do it in my room. I found out my parents have two meds that if you combine them and mybe drink some alcohol, it would be like a lethal injektion. If one night is bad enough i might take all of them and jug some vodka go back to bed to finish it. Do you think my parents would take it,as if it was their fault?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile i'm writing this i took a small amount of both meds just to test if i'm allergic so i don't die painfully.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pjqrcx/i_have_the_means/", "title": "I have the means", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "fuckthisplanetsh", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631032891, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pjqrcx/i_have_the_means/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427473.3352737, "replies_charged": false}
