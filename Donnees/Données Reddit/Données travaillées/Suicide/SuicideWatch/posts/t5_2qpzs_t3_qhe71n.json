I have Halloween, Christmas, my first concert, and then...\n\nNothing.\n\nI think I might end it after the concert, have one last happy day with my best friend listening to my second favorite band and then just go out.\n\nThe only thing keeping me alive right now is the constant escapism. I listen to podcasts and music to take my mind into new worlds, I read fanfiction constantly through the day just to get away from everything else, I sleep all the time just because I might get the reprive of nothingness, like death on a trial run.\n\nWhat is sleep if not death in a moment? You lay down, close your eyes, and fade into the nothing. No thoughts to plauge your mind, only rest as you lay there, still as a corpse, and wait in the blissful oblivion for another day. If sleep is death in miniature then death seems rather appealing.\n\nI cant get through school anymore, I just walk into class a minute late, put in some headphones, and do anything but really pay attention for an hour, then repeat 7 more times. Then I go home, put on some different music and do nothing all day, not even my school work. Then I lay in bed, chasing the reprive of sleep, like the nothingness of a dying flame inside me, hoping fruitlessly that I might not wake up tomorrow.\n\nI try to explain my feelings to the people around me but no one seems to understand. I tried to tell my dad, just last night, of what I can only assume is severe derealization and depersonalization and he looked at me first like I was insane and then like some sort of test subject. As if he could poke and prod at my view of the world, tearing holes in my already beaten and bruised mind, to try and understand how I work. Like I was a strange experiment and not his child.\n\nI dont want to feel like that again\n\nI dont want to feel again.\n\nMy grades used to be all As and Bs. Last year they dropped quite a bit due to the stress of my entire friend group being turned on me by someone I used to consider my partner, my love, my everything. I've been broken by people I've considered my friend far to many times. I think I'm just waiting for it to happen again.\n\nThis year, I can barely bring myself  to do my work, I ask my friends for help, they're nice and will give me the answers or help sometimes. I feel like a leech, sucking and draining them of their kindness and not being able to let go because I'll die without it. Maybe I should just go ahead and do it and be done with it all\n\nI wonder what my best friend would think, if they heard this I dont know what he'd feel. She'd probably be horrified, look at me like I'm a danger to everyone and myself, like I need to be watched over. I think that'd feel worse than being treated like a strange anomaly like most other do.\n\nI'm sorry for being all rambly and stuff, I just needed to vent out my feelings and I dont know where else to turn to. I dont have a therapist, they've all fallen through. I dont want to tell my parents, my dad'll just be too drunk to remember and my mom will either treat me like glass or say that I shouldn't feel this way. I cant tell the school counselor because then she'll tell my parents. I cant tell my best friend, I dont want to lose them too. I cant tell my online friends, they don't deserve that burden. So here I am, pouring out the roten contents deep within my gut for a bunch of strangers on the internet to pick through. I just hope these strangers may show a shred of sympathy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhe71n/ive_been_thinking_of_ending_things/", "title": "I've been thinking of ending things", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pixel_peep", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635392753, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhe71n/ive_been_thinking_of_ending_things/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425551.210079, "replies_charged": false}
