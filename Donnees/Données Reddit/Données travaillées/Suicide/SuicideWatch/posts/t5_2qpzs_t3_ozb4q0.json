But I can\u2019t any longer.\n\nTo My ex fianc\u00e9, I loved you with all my heart, and everything you\u2019re saying crushes me. Because I know that I loved you, and it hurts that even after all this I still love you. I\u2019m sorry you think the worst, but I promise you I never intended to make you feel anything but good. You don\u2019t have to believe me, but I never once cheated. Never even thought of it. You were my everything and will always be the most beautiful woman in the world to me. I really wanted to spend my life with you, but I pushed you away and learned that I didn\u2019t deserve someone so special. I wish I could go back in time, and make things better. Every morning I miss your smile, your eyes. I miss coming home and you asking \u201cwhat was the best part of your day\u201d. I miss how excited you got about 90 day fianc\u00e9 and new recipes you found on tik tok. You deserve the best life possible, and I hope that\u2019s what you have. Sincerely I did love you, and I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t good enough at showing you. \n\nTo my son, you\u2019re the best part of me but I feel I let you down. I gave myself to work, instead of you and I\u2019m sorry. I cant give back that time and I\u2019m sorry you have to go on without me. Your mom is an amazing woman, and she will make sure you\u2019re alright. The day you were born you lit up my life. Your smile, your laugh, your love for Mario and animals is so pure. Sitting here right now, I\u2019m not very proud of anything other than being your father. I love you so much. I wish I knew how to heal so I could be there for you. But this pain is just too much for me. My friend gave me his word if you ever chose to wrestle he will look out for you. I can\u2019t say I hope that you will, but if you do know I made sure people have your back. But please, ask your mom for advice she has the brains. You\u2019ll be better following in her footsteps. Please never think this is your fault, you\u2019re why I held on this long.\n\nTo your mom, please sell my house and anything in it you don\u2019t need. My code is still the same for my accounts every penny in it is yours. I\u2019m sorry I let you down, you were a godsend and I hate that we\u2019re here now. But I did love you, and I am ending this still loving you even though it\u2019s different it\u2019s still love for you. \n\nMom, I\u2019m sorry that this will hurt you. But I can\u2019t keep feeling this way. I\u2019ve fought off these urges for too long. I just can\u2019t keep doing it. I love you and thank you for all your sacrifices. \n\nBye, Aaron Michael William F.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ozb4q0/im_sorry_to_those_who_love_me_this_is_whats_best/", "title": "I\u2019m sorry to those who love me, this is what\u2019s best for me.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Aaron_michael_Fro", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628270274, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ozb4q0/im_sorry_to_those_who_love_me_this_is_whats_best/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428216.316811, "replies_charged": false}
