I know I said on my last post here that I was gonna OD in like five days from now but I want to escape *now*. The only reason I haven\u2019t done it yet is because i haven\u2019t finished my note. So I guess I\u2019ll just ramble now.\n\nOne reason for my urge to die right now is the fact that I have dance practice tomorrow. But it\u2019s not like I hate dancing, I guess it\u2019s the fact that I have to be active and that I have to interact with people when I\u2019ve been trying so hard just to get away from them so my upcoming suicide won\u2019t bother them. \n\nAnother reason is because of my mom. You might be thinking *\u201dwoah, they sound like they\u2019re an annoying, entitled brat\u201d*. So let me explain. I have odd and relatively unhealthy eating habits. It\u2019s been like this forever. So when my mom suddenly starts asking me what I want to eat more and buys a bunch of food, I find it odd. She\u2019s never done this. And I\u2019ve never thought too much about my eating habits so when she keeps bringing up the fact that I should eat more, it doesn\u2019t exactly feel nice. I don\u2019t know if I have an ED but my mom seems to see it that way. I know that she\u2019s just concerned but I don\u2019t like feeling smothered. And of course I haven\u2019t talked to her about this in depth because it\u2019s kinda taboo in my culture and I\u2019m an overall reserved person. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how many people will read this but if you\u2019ve made it this far, thanks I guess.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ogqi5u/meaningless_ramble_pt_5/", "title": "Meaningless ramble Pt. 5", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "toni_rigatoni", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625815370, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ogqi5u/meaningless_ramble_pt_5/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428432.37967, "replies_charged": false}
