My motivation is just gone. I have no motivation to clean my apartment, to do my laundry, to clean my plates and silverware, to do anything. Not even play video games. I've also been going through major mood swings where I'll post angry texts to family one day and want to cook dinner the next. I can't live like this anymore. I don't even know where to meet anyone. My city is just college kids and retirees. Can't find anyone my age who don't already have a family anywhere. I feel so alone. I also know that nobody will show up to my funeral because nobody cares. So how do I end things fast and efficiently?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5dkm7/want_to_die_quickly/", "title": "Want to die quickly", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ThanosisKing", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633890134, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5dkm7/want_to_die_quickly/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427622.0675645, "replies_charged": false}
