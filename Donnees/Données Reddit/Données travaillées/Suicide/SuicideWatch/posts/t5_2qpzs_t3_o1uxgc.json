I am currently angry and depressed on myself. Rethinking by life as of now, I can conclude that I am nothing but a waste of oxygen. I am just an embarrassment to parents, though the don't tell me to my face but the vocabulary they use to whenever talking to me whether to advice or comment on situation can be described as : 'Hey f*ckface, you aren't a 1% as your brother, but since we live in civilised soceity, we can't kick you out nor can we tell you to set yourself on fire, somehow read between the lines and relieve us'. \n\nBefore the pandemic, an exam would have set my life on an somewhat stable position but the covid-19 jerked it's balls dry on the very year I was ambitional. \n\n\nA brief history, I come from a highly dysfunctional family my mother once tried to burn me and often tried  to rip after school books and on several occasions spilled oil on books so that they become illegible. When I was 12 years old I had an accident I broke arm at the elbow joint, my father purposely took to government hospital just for cost cutting as result I had a bad operation and I open my arm to 180 degrees nor can I rotate via the elbow joint. He did just to as spend as minimum so that his work organization doesn't deduct enough that makes him ineligible for the a big fat premium ( which he spent to buy a bike). I tried hard to turn my life around. Now I am tired. \n\nI just want to die.
