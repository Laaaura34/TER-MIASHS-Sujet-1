But everything just keeps getting worse and worse. And no matter who or how often I ask to get help I always get shut down and ridiculed. I have diagnoses over diagnoses, but not even those I get treated or even taken serious at all for. \n\nAnd I am so goddamn envious of my future Mother in law. She isn\u2019t even actually in need of help, she just needs to accept her issues and be honest about them to herself to get better.\nYet she gets all the help I could ever ask for and isn\u2019t even remotely thankful for it.\n\nAll I got were 7 different antidepressants none of which did anything good; just side effects. One of them being never ending nightmares. I haven\u2019t slept well for years when I got them already and with the nightmares I can now sleep for 4 hours at maximum. Usually I can only do 2 though.\n\nI am so fucking tired.\nIf I had even half of the help she has, I\u2018d be stable right fucking now instead I am having a mental breakdown on her couch debating how to best kill myself, while she is at her Psychologist appointment which was supposed to be yesterday, but since she screamed at my fianc\u00e9 for nothing (claiming the victim card as always, even though no one was even attacking her or anything) she decided she wasn\u2019t able to go and told her psychologist that she had a mental breakdown and got another fucking appointment today.\n\nLet that sink in.\nI don\u2019t know about you. But back when I (at least) still had a psychologist I would have to pay 50\u20ac each time I could not get to my appointment. Sick spontaneously? That\u2019s too bad. 50\u20ac. Had an accident?  50\u20ac for you. Someone died? Tragic. Pay 50\u20ac.\nAnd a new appointment? Hell no. Next is in two weeks as always. No other appointments available.\nIf you need help fast go get yourself admitted to some psych ward. Who cares.\n\nAnd that was a child and adolescent psychologist.\n\nI told my Mother in law that. Nicely obviously.\nAnd her reaction was \u201eoh I am not gonna stay long today anyway I just don\u2019t want to.\u201c\nLike\u2026???\nThe audacity, the ungratefulness!\n\nI wish I could just leave and run into traffic or something, but my goddamn anxiety keeps me from even being able to leave the flat alone at all so that\u2019s out of the question.\nI have razors, but no bathtub and bleeding out wouldn\u2019t be fast enough. I don\u2019t want to be found.\nI don\u2019t want to be saveable.\nI don\u2019t want to deal with the consequences.\nI just want out.\nI wish I was never born.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ph3hki/mourning_who_i_couldve_been_if_i_had_the_help/", "title": "Mourning who I could\u2019ve been If I had the help everyone else in my country gets", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Samichaan", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630669307, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ph3hki/mourning_who_i_couldve_been_if_i_had_the_help/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426715.336389, "replies_charged": false}
