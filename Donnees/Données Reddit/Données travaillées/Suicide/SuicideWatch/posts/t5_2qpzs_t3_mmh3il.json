He says its because ive been having pity for myself and that I act like I have it the worst. He said don't make it a competition. I haven't though. I never said those things straight up I've only done little things like saying leave me alone or you dont know anything about me and stuff like that. I didnt realize I do those things until he told me. I cant help it. That's my constant state of mind. I feel comfortable in my self pity. I never even think of it like that it's just the norm for me. Maybe I should try harder to keep it to myself I dont mean to say those things they just happen.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mmh3il/self_pity/", "title": "Self pity", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Immediate_Zone_8315", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617845838, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mmh3il/self_pity/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423118.9073443, "replies_charged": false}
