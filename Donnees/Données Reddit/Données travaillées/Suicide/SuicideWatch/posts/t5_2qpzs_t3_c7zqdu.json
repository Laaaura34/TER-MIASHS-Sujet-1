I'm stuck in an eternal limbo between life and death, and I can never seem to chase enough highs to combat the overwhelming press of the universe. What does it all mean? I find myself only feeling love when I see the crystal clear bottom of my glass, empty of a drink much too strong for someone my age. The most damnable part of it all is that nobody understands. The one person I thought maybe did cheated on me. She looked at me like I was someone else when we made love. I could feel it before she said the words. Her touch was not for me, it was for another. So I pour another drink, and toast to my friends, my parents... But what does it mean? My vision is closed in. I am Schrodinger's cat. Disconnected and connected to the universe in the same blink of an eye. And while I am reminded of the good times, the bad loom over me, and the blood flows. What is the point? Why am I still here? Just to sit and live on another day. Impossible. This isn't living. It's portraying a husk of a human as a true being, but nobody is catching on to the subtleties. I think of killing myself more than ever these days. The release would be orgasmic, floating away to never have to see this God-forsaken planet again. But yet, here I am. Too yellow to fight the feeling, but stopping myself at the same time. One day I will say goodbye.
