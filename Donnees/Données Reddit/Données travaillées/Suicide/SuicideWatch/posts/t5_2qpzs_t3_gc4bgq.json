I know that I am blessed that I don\u2019t work an essential job and that I am healthy. This all just feels like too much. I\u2019m having panic attacks and physically shaking almost every night.\n\nI just don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ll make it out of this. Suicide is constantly on my mind. It\u2019s actually a thought that brings this weird sense of peace over me. I am scared about how real that option is becoming for me.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do to seek help. I just keep thinking to myself no one can really say or do anything to help because we all are living in this hell together. I have talked to therapists and the suicide crisis line. I appreciate the materials they give to help depression and anxiety. However with my past issues about anxiety I could always find a light at the end of the tunnel or a way out of that. With this I can\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel and I can\u2019t control any of it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gc4bgq/i_feel_like_im_not_going_to_make_it/", "title": "I feel like I\u2019m not going to make it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ghjhsde", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1588415593, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gc4bgq/i_feel_like_im_not_going_to_make_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426143.268208, "replies_charged": false}
