I'm disabled and tired of working until I collapse or faint daily. I'm about to lose my job because I'm so depressed from constantly suffering.     \n      \nI can't drive more than 5 miles. I'm always dizzy, always aching, and exhausted. My only escape is sleep.       \n\nMy dr is discussing a wheelchair soon. My first shot in May made my condition so much worse that I still haven't recovered and now I feel like I will eventually be forced to continue the series.    \n\n\nI look at housing prices, and I just want to sob. I'll never be able to afford my own place in this condition.  The medical bills just keep piling up while my ability to work keeps declining.    \n\nI have no family. I isolated myself away from friends when my condition got bad a decade ago because I got tired of constantly being asked if I was ok due to obvious symptoms that always appear.    \n\n\nI'm sorry for the pity party I just really don't know how people live like this and still find any kind of reason to keep going on. I'm in so much mental agony I want to scream until my lungs collapse but that would just get me hauled to a psych ward.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9ltl7/cant_find_any_hope/", "title": "Can't find any hope.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PM_ME_DEADPEOPLE", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634422433, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9ltl7/cant_find_any_hope/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423131.8197052, "replies_charged": false}
