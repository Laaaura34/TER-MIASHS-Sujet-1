Friends just say you should try therapy. I tried therapy 3 times. The first time, the therapist blamed my gf at the time. Second time, the therapist blamed me for being sexually assaulted and physically abused, and the third therapy ghosted me. I don't have the time or patience to keep trying therapy. My friends and family are getting sick of me. My best friends in the whole world, have their own problems and issues. I have been isolating myself. I keep hearing voices. I keep going through mood swings. I can't pay attention to save my life because I have diagnosed ADHD but isn't prescribed medication. I don't know how much longer I will be here. I'm so sorry I let everyone including the reddit community down. I fought. I lost. Goodbye.
