Fast forward a couple of years I managed to get some handle on my mental health was put on a multitude of meds which made  me more anxious and depressed, but I managed to study IT and get a software dev job. Still having underlying anxiety and depression by what I now know was caused by the meds.\n\nToday I'm now suffering with long term withdrawal from SSRI's after an incorrect taper given to me by maliciously incompetent doctors, leading to me being off work for 6 months, losing over 20,000 to scientology in attempt to resolve this situation and wanting to kill myself everyday.\n\n Just when things started going well i've managed to destroy everything and I'm now left with sexual dysfunction, insomnia, cognitive dysfunction and when i've tried to get some justice from the doctors they've denied they did wrong and lied about the advice they gave me.\n\nI hate life it's just constant pain and misery for me, all i ever try to do is get well and do well in life but it backfires.\n\nI'm done with this shit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q79h0i/my_lifes_been_destroyed_by_ssris_doctors_and/", "title": "My life's been destroyed by SSRI's, doctors and scientology", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "needhope1985", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634125949, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q79h0i/my_lifes_been_destroyed_by_ssris_doctors_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426537.0724752, "replies_charged": false}
