My brain have 2 separates ideas which make me feel crazy. Or I'm that stupid jerk, or my parents are the jerks. I really need to kill myself. But i have hemophobia (fear of blood) so i cant. Its strange actually. I wanna kill myself, but i wanna feel happy before i die. But. Just how. My sleep deprivations are growing. I was falling asleep around 1am. Now its 2:30 am. At this rythm i'll dont be able to sleep anymore before 2021. I just cant. I wanna kill myself but i dont know how to do it properly. I can just wait 'till im 18 to get a gun but 5 years is stupidly long. Everyday the wound gets bigger. But it never gets lethal. It just. Hurt. No one can fix that wound. The wound is that big that it's covering your whole body. Youre the wound. You hate the wound. You hate your whole body. You hate yourself. No ones sees the wound. No ones sees that bag of rocks, slowly filling up, to the point you cant get out of your bed anymore. Anyone can take a rock in his hand. But no one can take a mountain in his hand. No one can fix the wound. If you lose a part of your body, you'll get a prosthesis. But who can create a prosthesis of a life? No one. \n\nNo one can fix the fucking wound", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g7w4ju/am_i_sadomasochist_by_not_wanting_to_kill_myself/", "title": "Am i Sadomasochist by not wanting to kill myself?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Kalistoo8", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1587831329, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g7w4ju/am_i_sadomasochist_by_not_wanting_to_kill_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426136.8212056, "replies_charged": false}
