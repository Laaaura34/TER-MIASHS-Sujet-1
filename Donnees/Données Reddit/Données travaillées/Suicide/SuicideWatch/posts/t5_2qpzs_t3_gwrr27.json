I\u2019m 21 in college never had a job for longer than 3 months, don\u2019t have any internships coming (never had any either), never had close friends I could rely on, never been in a relationship let alone had sex. \n\nI\u2019m asian, live in a upper middle class area and have had a silver spoon up my ass since I was in elementary school. You don\u2019t have to feel much sympathy or empathy for me and I\u2019m not asking you too. \n\nFor me, my biggest fear isn\u2019t being homeless or dying, my biggest fear is being 30 years old having a dead end job, no friends, no family. I know what is at stake if I don\u2019t become successful or make a 6 figure salary by the time I\u2019m 30. I know what I lose. And I\u2019ve become accustomed to a comfy standard of living. \n\nI\u2019m a psych major. And I go to a cal state. Psych at my school is such a shitty fucking department. They never prepared me for anything. I\u2019m taking a Careers in psych course my LAST YEAR. This is a class that I should\u2019ve taken my first year! But nooo they only offered like 3 sections of the course to the entire department. And each class has a capacity of like 35 students. And bc picking classes goes by priority and how many units you\u2019ve collected guess who\u2019s dead last for the picking\u2014you guessed it, THE FRESHMEN. Idk wtf I\u2019m going to do with this major. I\u2019m not interested in research. I\u2019m not interested in doing a shit ton of extra schooling either. I\u2019ve talked to counselors. I go to therapy. But I\u2019m just so lost and indecisive. My family are pieces of shit and don\u2019t understand even if I explain. They just give me the same trite responses as always. I\u2019m feel so hopeless. I hate my brother. I hate him for choosing business bc a part of me wishes I could\u2019ve just chosen an easy bullshit major with clear an direct paths for people to take. I would\u2019ve killed it as a business major but I just had to choose  psych bc I felt like I wanted to help people. But my true self always get revealed. I want money. I want to have money and live a nice life. I will never make money and I will just be a fucking self pitying  loser all my life. \n\nI\u2019ve thought about suicide. I\u2019ve thought about killing my self and not having to live my life anymore. Not having to live up to my family but also my own high expectations. Being free of mental torture and envy and self hatred. But I can\u2019t bring myself to do it. I saw a clip once from this show true detective where this guy tells his partner that he doesn\u2019t have the constitution for suicide. And that resonated with me. I don\u2019t have the ability to pull the trigger. I\u2019d be sad for the pain my family would feel but also at the same time a bit happy that they suffer. And maybe they\u2019d take their own life bc of their suffering. But I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t kill my self bc I\u2019m selfish as well and narcissistic. I want to live bc I could maybe end up doing something with my life. It\u2019s sad and funny to think that that small silver of hope is what is keeping me from ending it. But it\u2019s so small. And if anything it\u2019s more fantasy than realistic hope. \n\nI love and hate my family. There are times where I fantasize about beating up my brother and punching him in the mouth. Telling him that I\u2019m  the better of us. And that I will always be smarter than him. That he chose the easy path and that if I were younger and able to see the mistakes of my older brother then ofc I could be successful. I hate mom. However I could never kill her or hurt her. I would just want her to suffer in some way. Financially where she doesn\u2019t mooch off of my father. My dad is someone who understands me pretty well. But even he is short sighted and doesn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to be a non business major. \n\nThere\u2019s so much anger in me. Anger in myself and others.  Anger that I\u2019m a loser and on the path to become one fully. Anger that my friends  are doing better than me when they can be pieces of shit. I\u2019m angry that I can\u2019t get myself out of this self pitying and just do something with my life. Also there\u2019s a lot of sadness. Im sad that I can\u2019t get myself out of this thought loop. This whole suicide and loser stuff always surfaces whenever it\u2019s triggered by too much time on my hands or someone Ik has done something good for themselves.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna reread this. I wrote this without stopping and I\u2019m sorry if it does t make sense or is too choppy. I\u2019m not going to kill myself. And ik then that this is the wrong sub. But at the same time I feel like it\u2019s the right one and idk why. I\u2019m sorry for the long read and weird format bc I\u2019m writing this on my phone. If you want to reply please go ahead. Don\u2019t feel like you have to beat around the bush and don\u2019t mince your words. You can be brutal and honest. Advice is welcome. Personal experience is welcome. I will read all responses but I don\u2019t reply bc I feel like it\u2019s an obligation to write something back that\u2019s heartfelt and I don\u2019t want to be repetitive with thank yous. So instead I will do this. Thank you for your replies and concern. I really appreciate it. I wish good luck to all of you on your respective journeys and hope that you all make it one day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gwrr27/i_dont_have_the_ability_to_kill_myself/", "title": "I don\u2019t have the ability to kill myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "theblackestballon", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1591309501, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gwrr27/i_dont_have_the_ability_to_kill_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426655.450468, "replies_charged": false}
