I crave the peace that comes with the price of ending my life, yet I don't know why or what is holding me back. I feel like there's this \"someone\" I really, really care about, and this feeling, of caring for said person has always thwarted my plans and made me always take a step back when I'd be convinced I would do it. Yet I still crave this peace, peace that can only be achieved by ending it all. My mind is a waterfall of thoughts, negative thoughts that is. I've become so addicted to feeling sad and miserable that it feels almost too taboo for me to feel happy and alright. I'm outright sabotaging my will to live purposefully, all while also doing my best to stay here. Everything that I write and think feels so contradicting. I don't know what to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mjvz5w/numbness/", "title": "Numbness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Jdefon", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617541875, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mjvz5w/numbness/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428451.0390773, "replies_charged": false}
