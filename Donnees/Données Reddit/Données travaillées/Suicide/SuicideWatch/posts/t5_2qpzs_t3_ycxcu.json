I just got an awful stomach ache, of course. Since then, I have attempted countless times. I am 16 now, and have not attempted since sometime in June. they've been weak attempts, of course, since I'm not dead. But each time I had the full intention to die, it just became too painful, my natural survival instinct kicked in despite my desire to die, a loved one stopped me, etc etc. I have tried so many different ways.\nI am curious if I'm the only one who has had so many attempts, and so many at such a young age. I began to self harm in 5th grade. \nI will answer any questions.\nI am very fascinated by the psychological aspects of suicide, as it is the goal of every human being to survive. And I am even more fascinated by my young child mind even being able to conceive the action of suicide, let alone attempt it.\nI posted this in /r/psychology and just got a whole bunch of shit for it. So I was hoping I could get a better response here.\nMy questions are if anyone else has experienced suicidal behavior at such a young age and the causes and mechanics of this.
