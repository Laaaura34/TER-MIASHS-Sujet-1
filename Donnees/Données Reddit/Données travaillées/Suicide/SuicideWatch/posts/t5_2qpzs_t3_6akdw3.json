He's deployed. He's been deployed for about three and a half months. Halfway done! We were so excited. His birthday was a month ago and we celebrated with a care package and a mini chat \"date\"...not really much else you can do when separated by 8000 miles. The gifts I sent in the package were meaningful, and he said they were the best gifts he's ever gotten. He even said again that two nights ago. \n\nI had just put in the mail his latest care package Tuesday afternoon. A whole bunch of \"open when\" letters for him to have during the tough times but when he can't call. Open when you're bored with a 6 page letter/funny story written completely in code and the key was hidden in pieces throughout all the other envelopes. (He's a giant nerd, well we both are...one of our first conversations was all about codes after he discovered that my text vibrations were set to Morse code. \"Oh so you're a SUPER nerd,\" he said to me with a wink.) Open when you're stressed with mini crochet doll for him to chuck at the wall and an encouraging poem from his favorite book. Open when you miss your dog with a mini realistic painting I did of her for his desk. Open when you need to laugh with three different funny stories I hadn't told him yet written book style...with pictures to boot. Open when you're homesick with an encouraging letter about how strong he is and how much faith I have in him. Open when you miss me with a love letter reminiscing some of our best moments before he left and how excited I was to have him home...looking forward to getting back to everyday life with him...a life that has felt nothing short of magical since he's been in it. \n\nYou know, shit like that. \n\nI sent him a picture when I mailed it. Sealed with a kiss and on it's way! He got to message me Tuesday night. He was excited for the package. He's been down...much more down than my usual sunny man...for a few months now, the deployment has really been wearing on him. He's overworked, sleep deprived, unfathomably stressed...and his main love language is touch. Which is the one fucking thing I absolutely can't give him right now even though I swear to god I would do anything at all to be able to. He's mentioned feeling distant from everyone, numb, emotionally detached, too exhausted to even make conversation...all of which is terrible and heartbreaking to watch him go through but honestly totally normal for the deployed. As in, 100% of the people I've talked to who have done this before have mentioned feeling the exact same things. It's the only way to cope with everything. Anyway, he hasn't been himself for a couple months now, but he's been super assuring that it's not me, it's nothing personal, it's nothing against our relationship...he's just having a hard time. Totally understand babe, I'm here for you, I'm okay I promise. I just want to be there for you. So while he was excited about the package coming, the only time I really get to see flashes of my chipper man anymore are when he receives them. THEN it's like Christmas morning. THEN he chatters on for ages about how happy something as simple as blue wrapping paper inside the box and a little pop up \"happy birthday!\" banner made him. THEN he's over the moon about little surprises and inside jokes that I've tucked in throughout the box...he says it's like a treasure hunt. \"I know you could come up with a thousand different ways to entertain me, so I'm always super curious to see what it will be this time.\" It pushed me to make every packaged meaningful, and try to make each one better than the last. That's why this one was a surprise...after touch on his love language hierarchy is words of affirmation, which is exactly what the ten letters were chock full of. \"I know I can't be with you day to day like I would be if you were home, so these letters are here so I can be there for you even when you are too stressed or unable to call.\" He knew nothing about what was coming, I had been keeping him in complete suspense, and holy fuck I couldn't wait for his reaction. I was certain it was the best package yet. \n\nWe were flirting after he got the picture. Little sexual innuendos, plans for when he got home...normal distraction chat. Anything except the negative reality he's in day to day. He's in the Middle East with strict sex laws so I'm not allowed to mail him anything sexual (though thank god for video chat and messenger to get around that) but he loves books over technology and was saying that he wished I could send him the boudoir book I made. For some reason the word \"boudoir\" made him think of book of all different bedrooms...so that's what he wanted, that was the silly next plan, \"a book of you in various stages of undress in various bedrooms. Perfect.\" \n\nBut then, in a literal second, everything changed. Suddenly he was apologizing. \"I can't see a future.\" \"I haven't been able to progress emotionally with you.\" \"You've been unimaginably supportive of me and done everything for me (I've been taking care of the house/bills while he's been gone and it recently flooded; I took care of it but he felt bad, which is what he's referencing) and I haven't done shit for you...I feel like such an asshole.\" What?? No, no no no no no. This is a goddamn deployment, we knew it would be hard. I knew you wouldn't be \"emotionally progressing,\" you're dealing with fucking war stuffs or whatthefuckever every single day. You haven't had a single day off in over two months. You're not an asshole, I don't expect you to be able to \"do anything\" for me right now, I promise. You focus on the job you have to do over there and on coming home safe, and let me focus on doing my job of taking care of you/the house and on supporting you the best way you need me to. When you get home and I got back to work full time THEN you can \"make up for it\" and be taking care of me. Okay? Relationships are a give and take; this isn't new, and it's seriously not a bother for me. I've actually really liked feeling like I can take some worries off his plate and send him a little relief in a box or a well-angled photo. I'm a giver; I love taking care of my love. \n\nIt didn't matter. He was so distraught. \"You didn't miss any signs...I meant everything I said earlier. I've been so stressed that I've pulled away from everyone, not just you. It wasn't personal. I didn't even make the decision until today.\" \"You're ideal for me...I don't know why I haven't been able to take the next step emotionally.\" (BECAUSE YOURE LIVING IN THE BOX IN THE DESERT ISOLATED FROM EVERYONE YOU LOVE AND HAD TO AMPUTATE PRETTY MUCH ALL EMOTIONS AND FEELINGS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE, MAYBE?!?) \"Please, please promise me that you won't view this as you being inadequate. I swear it has nothing to do with that. You're incredible...you have all these qualities (lists them) that I've been looking for.\" And when I argued that, how the hell could he say that and then say that he wanted to break up, I'm not trying to fight but clearly something's wrong....he said \"I AM trying to fight with you though because there has never been a moment where I've felt like you're not good enough for me. I had quite a few times when I felt the opposite.\" \"I hate this, I never wanted to hurt you, I don't know, I'm so so sorry...\"\n\nThis can't be happening right? It can't be. He hasn't even gotten the latest box yet! This isn't real life. I just send him pieces of my heart, more vulnerability and openness than I had ever put into words before, just hours before. I had just spent the week before cleaning the flooded garage...saving his woodworking projects, restacking the wood pile onto a pallet, washing gross floodwater dishes, repacking every. single. cardboard box, drying sentimental books page by page with a hairdryer, building a little makeshift dam on the inside of the garage door to hopefully keep more water out with the next rain.... I've been head over heels in love with this man practically since the moment I met him, and I would have sworn he felt the same. Our beginning was a whirlwind and right out of a rom com: we both shared that we felt like we had already known each other and been best friends for years, we were so comfortable around each other right off the bat. Hell, our third date was doing laundry. Not a euphemism, literally sitting on the bed folding underwear. Though our sex life was rockin too. Everything was perfect, and guys, I don't say that lightly. Same values, same moral/political/ethical/religious/blahblahblah view, same desires for life, same work ethic, intelligence level, interests...I felt like I had found the piece of me that I didn't even realize was missing when I met him. I felt whole for the first time, even though I would have sworn I was whole before. Friends and family have even approached me about this and made comments out of the blue...I'm the happiest I've ever been in my entire life, and it shows. So no, no way is this breakup thing real. He's just having a hard time. I'll write a more thoughtful and well put together response once the shock wears off and I put my head on straight. I got advice from other people who've done this on both sides, I wrote and rewrote and rewrote again. I love you, we're a team, let's get through this together. You're not a burden on me and this isn't a contest of who can do more. You're feelings of being emotionally detached are perfectly normal and most likely have everything to do with the deployment and nothing to do with us. You shouldn't make any big life decisions right now. You're almost done baby. You've got this, and I've got you. Cmon. \n\n\"I am confident in my decision. I'm sorry.\"\n\nAnd just like that, none of it matter. My fun, loud, cheery man who could talk the most southern of gossiper's ladies ear off was reduced to one, melancholy, terse sentence. A man who normally goes out of his way to overexplain because he wants to make sure the communication is clear. A man who, when I was worried about getting in the way of him preparing for this deployment, took my face in his hands and said, \"look at me. You're not a burden. I swear to you.\" before giving me a kiss on the forehead....an unbelievably sweet and calming gesture that I can't even extend to him right now. \n\nI feel like he's a different person. I've never felt pain like this before. I feel like every piece of me is being slowly crushed...I can't breathe, I can't move, I can't sleep, I can't even cry: it's just streams of tears falling from my eyes now. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to live my life without him. Everything that was in color is now in...whateverthefuck is worse than grayscale. I don't want to have to get my things from the house. I don't want to miss his homecoming. I don't want to go back to work without him there to celebrate with me. \n\nI could see my whole life with him in a way I never could before. Now I see no future. I may as well lay down and rot.
