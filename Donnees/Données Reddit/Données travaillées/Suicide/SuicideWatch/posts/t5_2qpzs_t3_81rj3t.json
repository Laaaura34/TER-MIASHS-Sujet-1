There\u2019s really no more ways to improve my chances for anything because I\u2019ve tried everything I realistically can and it still wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nI\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts for almost a decade and couldn\u2019t talk to anyone about it because one wrong move and it will literally get me locked up somewhere and leave a permanent record to ensure that my already lost cause has no chance of redemption. Not to mention the amount of time and money that will be wasted.\n\nI also don\u2019t think that there is a universal, logical argument to support an inherent value to life, or why one should live. Yes, people can \u201cmake the best of the present,\u201d but why should one choose that over just quitting life? We all know that \u201cit gets better, you have so much to live for, and think of the pain you\u2019ll cause to others\u201d is also just emotional bullshit that holds no real weight to people who don\u2019t care about emotional talks and want logical reasons to keep on living. Maybe it works for people who are having an isolated, spontaneous desire to die, but not for someone like myself, who\u2019s been thinking about suicide for almost a decade and definitely wanting to die for the last 5 years.\n\nThe thing is, I would love to talk to a professional just to see how different they would be compared to shitty internet lists with \u201cpeople are having sex right now and all you can think of is suicide? Come on!\u201d as one of their 50 reasons against suicide. Surely they\u2019ve dealt with people who want an objective reason to not kill oneself; have they given any thought into this argument? But guess what, they\u2019re expensive and they can call 911 against me any time they feel like I\u2019m going to do something whether that\u2019s true or not. There won\u2019t be any candid conversation with that kind of pressure, and there won\u2019t be real help (if it even exists) without a real conversation.\n\nI think the ability to call 911 for a forced admission pretty much kills all chances for meaningful help for people like me.\n\nOh also, I don\u2019t want to \u201ctalk about\u201d my life and don\u2019t care if you\u2019re \u201chere\u201d for me, so please save those comments to yourself.
