I broke up with my girlfriend because I thought I was being toxic and I couldn't stand to hurt her anymore with what i was doing. I did some fucked up things that I don't think i can ever forgive myself for and I feel like a massive piece of shit for projecting my insecurities and being an all around asshole and manipulator to the sweetest girl I've ever known. I took her for granted. \n\nI just really want to kill myself because what if I can't change? I'm not the type of person to let go of regret easily, and I feel like this is too big for me right now. I want to get better, I want to be a better person, but to me this is just way too much. I never prided myself with having the best moral integrity, but I never thought I could go and be a full-on piece of shit to the person that I loved and it's making me confused about myself and it's honestly why i just wanna fucking die bro. I just wanna kill that part of myself that just fucks everything up.\n\ndon't worry, i don't have a plan and I don't have access to guns. I am currently a relatively low risk of suicide. But still, the thought lingers and I have to let it out somehow.
