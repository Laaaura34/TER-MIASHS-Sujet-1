Opening your eyes and looking about is like looking through a warped glass window, or a faulty camera lens. Those are eyes that should have been shut, gone dark, permanently, just a few hours ago. Getting out of bed, or hauling yourself off the floor, feels so stiff and unnatural. These limbs should have stilled, these feet should no longer be able to walk.\n\nYou never planned to wake up this morning. But now you're here.\n\nCarrying on like nothing happened creates a disjointed sense of reality, like everything is far away and unreachable. People laugh, and slap you on the back, and say hello, without the faintest idea what you tried to do. What you almost achieved.\n\nI could have been at peace by now. Instead, it's just another day.\n\nYou'd think I'd be used to it by now.
