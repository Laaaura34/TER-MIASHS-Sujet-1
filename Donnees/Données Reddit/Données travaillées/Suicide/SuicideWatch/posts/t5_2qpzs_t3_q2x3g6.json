And ive overdosed once half intentionally, but otherwise ive never felt that i actually genuinely want to take my own life. \n\nIve just recovered from an addiction, i\u2019m 19. I\u2019m pretty sure i\u2019m a hypochondriac bc of my addiction, so i\u2019m basically having severe anxiety 24/7. \nBut this last week ive been laying awake at night just planning suicide. I don\u2019t want to live, there\u2019s no reason to. The only reason humans live is to work and earn money, that\u2019s what we do from the moment we graduate from school until we die basically. And I just don\u2019t feel like i want to breathe anymore, my anxiety is so severe, the help in the country i live is bad. They don\u2019t take me seriously. And i feel like to go to the emergency psych ward is too much for me bc then it becomes real, and my family needs to know about it. \n\nThe only reason i\u2019m alive is bc of my best friends and my family and my dog. I can\u2019t for the life of me fathom the fact that they\u2019ll never stop mourning my death. And i feel selfish for even thinking of ending it. But i just don\u2019t see a future for myself, i don\u2019t look forward to anything, it\u2019s all just meaningless. \n\nAnd i\u2019m so scared, i\u2019m so frightened by myself. What if i do it? I have no idea what i\u2019m capable of and it scares me. I don\u2019t want to disappoint my closest people, but i don\u2019t want to breathe another second.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q2x3g6/i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "title": "I don\u2019t know what to do", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "isbalele", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633565820, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q2x3g6/i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426736.3382857, "replies_charged": false}
