They said that someone they knew died by suicide and that\u2019s what was making them emotional. I feel really bad for upsetting them, but I\u2019m also really at a loss because I feel like I can\u2019t talk to my therapist about how suicidal I\u2019m feeling anymore. \n\nEverything is losing its grip on me. I\u2019ve been in this place a 100 times since I was a child and I\u2019m really really feeling that things aren\u2019t going to be changing for me  since I feel like this so often. I have complex ptsd. I\u2019m getting closer to suicide, and I\u2019ve just lost a major support because of how upset they were. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t have the capacity to get a new therapist, so it feels like everything is coming together for me to just end things, as the therapy was my last\nHope", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwuul1/therapist_cried_throughout_my_session_about_my/", "title": "Therapist cried throughout my session about my suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bluelagoon12345", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 512, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632790334, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwuul1/therapist_cried_throughout_my_session_about_my/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635421074.1015608, "replies_charged": false}
