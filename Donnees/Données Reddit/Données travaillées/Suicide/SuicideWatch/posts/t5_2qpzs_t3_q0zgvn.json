Each day is getting stranger and stranger and I'm getting so desperate. I made what was supposed to be a brave act to ask someone for help for the first time and it's had me so confused and anxiety ridden with nausea and not knowing anything anymore.\n\nThe person who I reached out to agrees we should go to ER if mental hospital is not open yet. It would give me priority care and I would be able to stay safe while being cared for in ER until I get spot on mental hospital.\n\nMy current thoughts have me wondering if I could speed up the process by downing a few extra ibuprofen and them putting as many as possible and spitting them out and... make it LOOK like I attempted as a final cry for help?? Is that ridiculous? I feel like I should know that it is wrong and messed up and I just need to hang on but I can't tell anymore \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI'm in a state where I don't feel much pain... I could openly make it clear that I was cutting away...\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with me? Why can I only Invision different ways to kill me but still be able to act \"happy\" and play along? \n\nI ignore mostly every urge, but I'm still acting slightly more high risk....\n\nAdvice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q0zgvn/how_fucked_up_would_it_be_to_feign_a_suicide/", "title": "How fucked up would it be to feign a suicide attempt?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LostGirl42", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633326794, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q0zgvn/how_fucked_up_would_it_be_to_feign_a_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427959.3785136, "replies_charged": false}
