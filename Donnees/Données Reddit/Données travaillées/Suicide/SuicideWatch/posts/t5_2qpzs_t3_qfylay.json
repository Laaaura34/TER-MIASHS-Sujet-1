And that darkness bled through. October 24th I attempted to take my life by driving into a tree after drinking all evening. I was placed in holding on suicide watch. Released same day , hours later. Health and wellness check up that following morning per my Navy Senior Chief (retired). I'm former Navy active duty. Two global war on terrorism medals. 2016 deployment. Honorably discharged 2018. I haven't felt whole since I got out. I'm reaching out to AA and VA crisis line to discuss my issues and PTSD struggle. My charge of DUI will be dropped once I do a course for veterans who reach a point where I was at. Today I'm alive and depressed. I should have reached out sooner to the military community, family and friends I took too long to realize my depression could kill me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfylay/attempted_vehicle_suicide/", "title": "Attempted vehicle suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DigitalAsh11", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635222547, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfylay/attempted_vehicle_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635421092.039973, "replies_charged": false}
