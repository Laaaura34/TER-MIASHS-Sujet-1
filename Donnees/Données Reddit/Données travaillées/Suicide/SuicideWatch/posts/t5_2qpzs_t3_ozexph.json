My first time ever opening up about these things past a therapists office (not that they ever really helped, they only ever saw me as a fascinating specimen). So buckle in, because we are about to go on a roller coaster here.\n\nI am 24 and I honestly don't want to be alive anymore. I guess you could label me as an \"empath\", because I have been repeatedly sucked dry and spat out by everyone and everything and yet I still go back for more. Even though I don't even think I am worthy enough to be labelled an empath at all. I just feel like a waste of space that spends all their time making everyone else happy but themselves. I spend more nights wishing I wouldn't wake up the next morning than I do hoping for a fresh new day.\n\nWhere to begin. My family left my home country when I was just over a year old to give me a better life that I would have had. I feel so horrible for my parents, because it almost feels like it was worse in the end. I feel so guilty that they had to leave everyone and everything behind for me, just to have this happen. The first fe years of my life were amazing. I still remember it so vividly. I was so outgoing and had so many friends that were like family and I just felt like I could fit in and be myself in the process. I was always a sensitive kid. My mom always said I had a strong sense of justice and empathy as a child. More than most kids would at that age. We had this amazing next door neighbour. She was like a grandmother to me and my then new little brother. She was such a ballsy old woman. I miss her. We also had a dog. She was a present that I got and I loved her so much. But then we moved. We had to leave everything behind again. This time we left because I got sick all the time in the cold climate. I had to get my tonsils removed and everything. I had non stop ear infections and really severe asthma. It just wasn't great.\n\nI had done my first two years of schooling in that place and it was so difficult to assimilate into this new environment. My first week of school I had kids telling me to go back to where I came from ( I was 5 at the time). I went from a place that was so safe and welcoming, to this. A place where for the next 8 years I would endure some of the worst things. Things no person should have to. Because of my previous schooling, I was ahead of all the kids my own age, but I was still pretty terrible at math. My mother as a educator warned the school when they tried moving me up a grade and for a year I went between grade 1 and 2. So much so that the kids in both grades pushed me out of all the social groups. I was alone. Two months into being at school, I never wanted to go back again. Grade 2 came around and apart from now being isolated, I had a girl who was supposed to be my friend kick me in the face. After this happened I started having my first thoughts of death. It may not seem like too many bad things had happened to this point, but all I wanted was friends and to feel home. I have never felt home again since I was 4.\n\nFast forward to grade 4. At this point my mom started working at the school. The principal had an adopted child at the school. Everyone garnered a lot of sympathy their way for many reasons. But they were not what they seemed. Starting that year, I was 8 going on 9. This person, this fellow peer. They started sexually assaulting me. I didn't really know what was happening or that it was wrong. All I knew is that they threatened my mom's job and that people would think I was horrible if I said anything. I was too young to understand. It went on for months. It got pretty vile. And it happened right at the school, under everyone's noses. One day I told my friend who then told a teacher after I had asked her not to. Looking back today, I am so grateful for this person and always will be. They probably don't remember me, but I will always remember them for trying to help me. So the teacher called all three of us in. The teacher had the audacity to ask me if I wanted it. I was 9! The student tried saying I did and gave me a look I could never forget, like \"say yes or else\". I then looked at my friend and she had the look of \"tell the truth\" and I did. The teacher then asked me if I wanted my parents to know. Again, I was 9. She should have told them regardless, but I said no out of embarrassment and my parents never knew. The teacher made us go sit outside and eat lunch together and be friends, knowing what had happened. It later led to a lot of confusing thoughts through my development that were not healthy for me. Fast forward to when I was 15 and had finally left that school, I finally told my mom in the parking lot of the church we went to for the longest time, where this person and their family started going. I felt like someone had slammed a hole through my chest when I found out there were others after me. Younger than me. I felt so responsible for that. I still do. If I had said something then. We tried getting the police involved, but it became too much for me and I couldn't see it through. My mom still had to work for the adoptive parent of this person for many more years. All the cases were swept under the rug.\n\nBack on track though from the age of 9. From there life did not get any easier. Anyone I had managed to make friends with just left and the rest... Just plain cruelty. But for me it was better to be in the presence of cruelty than be alone. I was a pretty smart kid. Super fascinated with nature and animals. I had high expectations on me from my parents. I understand they wanted the best for me, but I guess that's where my \"people pleasing\" behaviours stemmed from. If I didn't do well enough I was often berated. By my father more so than anyone else. At this point my parents didn't really know anything about what I had gone through. I spent most of my time on the school grounds oval either lying at the back of the field talking to the cows, walking and singing or just staring at the surrounds. It was better than being around the people that just felt the need to cut me down every time they saw me. I had super long hair that seemed to bring in a lot of attention. The kids would yell \"flush the toilet\" and then yank my ponytail behind me as hard as they could. Because I was a pretty bright kid, the kids often had me do their work. It was better to just comply than not. Then because I really liked nature I was just called an animal freak. There were a few times I would pick up injured animals and I would just get absolutely verbally hammered by people for caring. There was one friend I had. Probably the best friend I ever had, but she left. I never had another friend like her again.\n\nAs I started moving through middle school things got bad. I started going through the processes of maturing and because of everything I had bottled up, it kind of got unleashed through acting out. My parents didn't understand and I could hardly blame them. There were many times my dad threatened to hit me through a wall. One instance where my mother slapped me in the face. My dad was really big on intimidation though and manipulation through gifts. This would be quite telling for my choices of relationships later in life. At one point my mother lost it at me and told me if they got a divorce it would be my fault and I was constantly pitted against my \"perfect\" little brother. He always had it easier. Moving into grade 6 and 7 there came a time where I was trying to fit in a bit more. I was sick of sitting on the outside. So I started being a person I really wasn't on the inside. But I was just that person they hung out with to make a joke out of. At this stage the person that had done those things to me at the age of 9 came back to the school. In later years I figured this short break away was post the initial court case taken out on them by the person that endured what I had after me. Bu they came back the same bully as before. One lunch I went to go to my usual spot at the back of the field when they were there with some guys. I tried walking past and they called me out and told me to go away (in not so nicer terms) and that no one wanted me there. That day something in me just awoke and I thought screw this I am standing up for myself today. I told them I could go where I wanted and that they didn't have to be the way they were. As I kept walking they came up to try and intimidate me and then attempted to push me. I put my hands out in defence and of course I got in trouble. Later I gave this school a real reason to get me in trouble.\n\nGrade 8 would be my final year at this school. Boy was it a ride. I spent most lunches in the toilets and started blowing off school altogether. Not only was a boy paid by another boy to try and date me to make me fall in love with him just to hurt me, but the day I found out I was leaving, there was hell about to break loose. I had experienced so much pain, humiliation and heartbreak. There were two more bullies in this part of my life. They decided to start picking on my origin. Just like primary school all over again. I had had so much patience with the hurt I had experienced that these two boys were the ones that were going to cop the short end of the stick. We were lined up outside a class and the teacher was late. These boys started bagging on me, again. I very calmly turned to them and said if you don't stop I am going to end up hitting you. They didn't believe me and they kept going. In a split second all the emotions I had held within me for years came out in one square punch to the one guys face. One student asked them \"what did you do to make \\*redacted\\* react that way?\" talking about me. I had been so passive that no one expected it. Of course I was the one that got in trouble (as a staff child too) and they got off scot free. And I had never seen my dad prouder of me than he was that day. He called everyone to say I clocked a guy in the face. Never did I see him that proud ever again (except for the time I got cast as a male character making some sandwich jokes for a school feminist piece, but thats a whole other story). A couple months later, I clocked another guy in the face that had given me a hard time. I guess it just felt like for once I had control over something and I could defend myself. Of course now I understand there was probably other ways to go about it, but it was hard when no teachers listened to me and just told me to \"get over things\" all the time or to \"not be so serious\". I guess I just took my power back in those moments.\n\nIn any case, I ended up getting out. It was the best I had felt in a long time. Although this new school was amazing, it brought on new challenges. Ironically in grade 9, my dad made me break up with a person over race things. Then this same person ended up becoming my first kiss in grade 10. But they were ashamed of me. They were a real player and they will appear many more times. Let's call them \"X\". So X wanted to keep me a secret. We weren't dating, but no one could know that we were hanging out. Then one day they started dating another person and just ignored me. Even their friend's started picking on me \"like this \"person\" would ever like you\". But I just moved on (for now). At this time I started seeing my first ever counsellor (school counsellor). They were great to talk to, but they didn't really help me work through stuff. But it was a good first step. This is when I told my parents about what had happened, as after this. Grade 11 was pretty chill. I was so happy that I got to see my favourite grandma that year. Heavens I loved that woman. My mom always said I am just like her to a T. I am also the only descendant of her's that paints just like she did. Anyways, move onto end grade 11, I fell in love with this person (lets call them \"W\"), but they started dating my friend. But said friend started telling me about them cheating on W. I didn't interfere, but their relationship did fall apart after about 2 months, but they were still going to go to the senior prom together. \n\nFast forward grade 12. It was the best and also the worst year of my life at this point. I had so many amazing experiences, but I also had my worst anxiety episodes and depressive pits. My extra curricula like singing and drama and art were the only things that kept me above water. I got early admittance into university too, which I declined for reasons I will get to. Beginning that year I wanted to lose weight for the prom. It got bad, because it slippery sloped into anorexia when W started noticing me and complimenting me. We eventually started getting together a couple days a week, but they were still in love with my friend. I was too blind at the time to see how stupid I was being. At this point, no one had asked me and so I ended up finding my own date outside school to bring. Come prom night, I had my date and W went with their ex. But then W's ex wanted to switch seats with me to sit with my date and my date insisted. So I did it. I didn't see my date all night after that. All the people stole him away and I spent my night trying to make this person I was so in love with feel better. So it just became an overall shitty night (first world problems huh?). About a month later we started dating after they had already broken my heart repeatedly. Should have probably been a sign for me. At this point I was so badly starved and over exercising so much, I started having severe dizzy spells and cold sweats. My parents found out and since starting to eat then, I have struggled with maintaining a stable weight since. I only ever eat too much or too little. The rest of grade 12 seemed well enough. I ended up in a gallery with one of my pieces, which was great. Our choir won both regional and national comps. And I thought I had just found the love of my life. Everything was falling into place. I was 17.\n\nAt the end of the year I got my university offers and one of them was for agricultural science. Thats the one I accepted. Its what all my teachers and both my parents wanted. I still remember pretending to be so super happy about it when it wasn't really what I wanted. Nevertheless I spent two years doing it, away from home. Isolated, again. W didn't like it, but as time would tell, W didn't like not seeing what i was doing all the time. They didn't like me having friends that i could talk to about them. W started becoming quite emotionally and mentally abusive. They didn't want me going out or drinking or doing anything really and of course, being all love sick like I as, I complied. It got so bad that I spent all day in my room with the curtains closed, barely ate and even skipped classes, because honestly, I didn't want to be there. I ended up with severe depression, vitamin D deficiency and iron deficiency. Overall shiteshow. I met a person that not only became my only friend, but also in the end convinced me that I shouldn't wait on certain things in my relationship and just give in. I regret that. Every time W and I would try, I would started crying uncontrollably. Not because I didn't want to be with them, but I just wasn't ready to give up that part of myself to anyone yet. I was 18 and I finally gave in. Not because I wanted to, but because I knew W was growing impatient. My logic to overcome my fear was that \"W was the one anyways so why not\". There was nothing romantic about it and it didn't mean the same to them as it did me. It was a strange moment in time. I wish I never did it, because it let them dig their claws deeper into me. I always had this affinity to give people not just all of me to the last, but even when I had nothing to give, I would still keep giving. Since this gave them more control over me, their treatment of me only got worse. They would start slamming doors, punching holes in walls, slammed a car door on my leg (and I still got up to comfort them) and even hitting me in the face once IN FRONT OF THEIR OLDER SIBLING. They didn't say a thing. After a year and half of this, I ended it for good. I was devastated. I thought he was going to be the end.\n\n Near the very end of this relationship, one of our closest friends had just broken up with one of our other longtime friends. I had known this person for close to 7 years at this point. Trusted them with my life. I was one night away from going away for a family trip and I offered to go out and offer them an ear as I had done for other friends of ours in the past. They tried r\\*ping me in their car. I kind of froze in shock and when they realised they weren't going to get anything from me, they started watching p\\*rn next to me and m\\*st\\*rb\\*ting. I just sat there and just looked out the window pretending nothing was happening, because I couldn't really get out of the situation either. When I told W what had happened, they said it was my own fault and then they went on to tell all our friends what had happened. This was one of the main reasons I left in the end. I just felt alone and shamed all the time. If it wasn't my body, it was my face, or my clothes or in this case this situation. I went through 6 months of severe depression, I had my first real battle with suicide at this point. It felt like I was fighting the devil in my head. It was horrible. I felt like a child that was trying to fight for survival. Shortly after this I met the next one. I was never one for \"just getting with people\". But I was so low, I thought why not. But they were not healthy. At all. Lets call them G. G was a peculiar character. We were officially together for about a year and a half. We did long distance for a long time and it was ok, but their mother always got involved, but G was also a prolific cheater and liar. We never really fought, but they also had no ambition in life while I was just starting to put mine together. 6months into talking I started my dream degree (which I finished last year). There isn't much to discuss here, except for one life changing moment. The last time they cheated on me, I found out a week later I was pregnant with their child. I was forced back into his grasp. I was disowned by my father through this. Completely blocked out from the family and I had to stay with G through this all. The pregnancy lasted 5 weeks and 6 days. It ended the night before I was going in to hear the heart beat for the first time. I was so unbelievably in love with this baby despite the circumstances. When i lost them, I was devastated beyond repair for a very long time. I was 20. I still think about them 3 years down the line. I tried staying with this person for a while longer, but it inevitably fell apart. I ended up going my own way and for the first time in the longest time I felt so liberated and free. I felt good. I felt ok being alone. I was enjoying my own company.\n\nFast forward 6 months. I started painting for the first time in 5 years again. It was amazing. I started doing markets and just taking part in things that made me happy. Then they hit me like nothing else. My big love. I wasn't looking for it, I wasn't trying to get into a relationship. i actually kept fighting it for a long time, but they sucked me in whole into their absolute warmth. Call them B. I have never in my life wanted someone in my life so badly. It was like it fell right out of a fairy tale. It just felt so right and natural. But if it had worked out, i wouldn't be here spilling my guts out. We had so many challenges. We were in two different countries and many years apart in age. But I couldn't even tell you how much I felt for this person. I could't contain it in my body how I felt. Even now after everything they put me through. I wanted them for everything.\n\nBefore I continue. Over this next two and a half year timeline:\n\n\\- I lost my grandmother in a span of two weeks - week 1 she was admitted to hospital, then diagnosed with lung cancer and my mother went to see her on an emergency flight while I was on a research trip and I found all of this out on social media - week 2 she suddenly had brain cancer and then just passed. Week 3 was the funeral via live feed due to it being overseas pre 2020. She had struggled with alzheimers for quite sometime, but her passing was horrible. I miss her all the time.\n\n\\- I had my first ever major surgery and it was botched  I was stuck in bed for 2 weeks and then not allowed to do anything really for about 4.\n\n\\- I lost 4 animals to tragic and sudden instances - dog of 16 years to severe kidney failure and the initial vet still tried making money out of her - one guinea pig to unknown circumstances and another to pneumonia - bird of 14 years to assumed cardiac arrest.\n\n\\- My mother went to hospital suddenly for a week or so.\n\n\\- Overall 2020 things - lockdowns - lost my job, learning online, no grad ceremony after 7 years of studying etc.\n\nForgive me if there is little coherence here as it is still so fresh. So B, oh B. They swept me off my feet. We both do art, we both listened to the same music, watched the same stuff. We understood each other. They actually pursued me. Made me feel special and loved for the first time ever. I felt so safe with them.Everything was so amazing... But they had issues just like I did. While mine were mostly emotional, theirs was more physical. They drank. A lot. They were amazing, until they started staring down the chute of a bottle. But I wanted to work through it with them. I wanted to show them a love and patience no one had ever shown them before. But that would never be reciprocated. My life was going great. Until 2020. Then things started changing. Their life started REALLY  working out. B started having less time for me. While my life was falling apart, their's was getting better. They started getting these massive commissions, meanwhile I was standing in unemployment lines. I was struggling. All these past issues started arising in my mind again, because for the first time in a long time I slowed down. You know how they say you can't outrun the past. But all I wanted was to spend time with them - we planned many dates, but at this point they either forgot or they got drunk instead. I probably wasn't as supportive as I could have been and I'll always regret that. I was struggling so much alone and so many promises were broken, I just couldn't hold it. They were supposed to be at my graduation, but obviously with all the lockdowns, we didn't get to see each other at all. For 2 years. It devastated me. But they continued on and it was like the more time went by where we couldn't see each other, the more they started to make plans without me. \n\nOne of the reasons I fell so deeply in love with them was because for once, someone thought I was important enough to integrate into their life plan. But over time, every time I brought up conversations about the future they just got mad at me. Any time I tried talking about anything at all bothering me, they would just be mad and get frustrated. Like with anything, the more it got pushed down, the more it came up and it just pushed them too far. They broke my heart again and again and again. I couldn't even tell you how many times and I came back with just as much love as I did before. Every time. They stopped reciprocating over time and it just made me doubt even more. They kept saying they were just too busy or too tired all the time. We went from talking everyday for hours, to maybe sending a couple messages a day. When I came at them with the same level of energy as we did in the beginning, then i was \"too clingy\". I tried carrying the relationship for both of us for a really long time. But I guess I just wasn't a priority in the end. Beginning 2021, New Years, they were drunk again and we started fighting. Two days later they broke up with me over messenger - I was empty. Two days after that they came back again. Stupidly, I agreed. A while ago I then helped them through a suicidal patch. I was worried sick. i had never seen them so bad and I was there for them night and day. Anything they needed I was there. Move to a month or so ago, I was lucky enough to paint a car. I was so excited as I had always wanted to do that. I had met a person while I went on a \"solitude\" trip that had this car. In any case. they ended up swinging by so I could do this project. It was purely business to me. I was so proud of it and I was so excited for when it would be over so I could talk to B properly about it all, because they understood the stresses of these things. I still spoke to B every day I was working on this car, but I couldn't speak very liberally. But the day we planned to hang out and talk... B was drunk. They then started going off at me saying this person would have never let me paint their car if they didn't want something from me. Basically implying that I cheated, when there was no reason to think that or even any evidence. I had never given them a reason not to trust me. I only ever saw them. For the first time ever I was with someone and I had zero interest in \"window shopping\" so to speak. The thought of another human then and even now made/makes me nauseous. I live with my parents and my brother was around the whole time - not that anything would have happened regardless. I was devastated. I was so excited to talk to them again and things had been feeling more normal in that period of time than it had in a long time. Then out of the blue that happened. I completely broke in that moment. The more I told B to let me talk and listen to me and hear me out, the more agitated B became. They started telling me they no longer felt anything for me and to f\\*ck off and that this meant nothing to them. It wasn't the worst I'd ever heard from them or anyone else, but it still hurt like hell. Maybe because it was so unexpected. I spent the rest of the day sobbing. I just thought it was some drunken rage. The next day B sent me a message saying they were going to block me and I don't even remember what else. It was an absolute blur. We then spoke on the phone and they realised how ridiculous their accusations were and stupidly I went back to B again. Most recently, I asked them where we stood and how they felt about me. But B didn't want to give me an answer. So I would let it go for a bit, but you know these things just eat at your mind. The last time I asked B, they said they didn't want me anymore. B wanted me as a friend, but didn't love me anymore. B steamrolled over my soul yet again. They went from me wanting to be the mother of their children, me being their one, their amor, the person they wanted to do life with, to a burden, an emotional wreck and a nobody.\n\nI haven't spoken to them in a few days now and I know I shouldn't. I know it sounds horrible, but I am still so in love with them and I probably will be for a long time. I gave them everything. My whole. I was so sold on this person like no one ever before. I just feel broken and empty. I honestly just want to disappear. I have been sleeping more hours than I have been awake, because the pain is just too much. I realised my needs were so deprived by this person that the only time I would hear, see or feel what I needed to feel loved or appreciated, was when i closed my eyes at night and dreamed. Before everything went south, I had never felt so connected to someone in my life. They know more about me than any living person on this planet. They were more planet. They were my all. They demolished me mentally and emotionally. They have broken my soul.\n\nI will never be able to let anyone in ever again. Everyone can see how broken I am right now. Everyone but the person I love that did this to me. They act like they care, but they never once flinched when they saw my heart break in front of them. I am just so done. I have nothing left. I feel no purpose. No fulfilment. Everything I would have had to convince me to stay was ripped away from me. I could never wish my pain on anyone else, not even those who hurt me. But all I feel is pain and emptiness at the same time. I feel like a failure. A mess. A complete disaster.\n\nFor those of you that got this far, I thank you for taking the time to read this all. I know it is a lot. It just kind of happened. But I wish all of you as much happiness as the world can provide you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ozexph/i_dont_really_know_what_i_am_doing_here/", "title": "I don't really know what I am doing here", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "arrow5683", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628281953, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ozexph/i_dont_really_know_what_i_am_doing_here/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422256.9775033, "replies_charged": false}
