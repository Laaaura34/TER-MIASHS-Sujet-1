Stimulants make me a less emotional guy so it helped stabilize my mood for the depressive day. I was able to focus for my solutions.\n\nPossibly the game-changer to mix with benzos & alcohol, something to confirm my death.\n\n**Benzodiazepines:**\n\nClonazepam didn't do shit for my severe anxiety, absolutely fuck all. Same thing with lorazepam. \n\nIt only made my muscles & general body relax, although not my mind, it was a very confusing experience. You'd expect it to sedate me, but no, it was useless.\n\nIt'll be useful for suicide as it does slow the body down.\n\n**Alcohol:**\n\nIt's far better at disinhibiting me, but man it's not enough and not ideal to rely on. I don't like drinking much anyway, I could never get addicted to this.\n\nUseful for suicide.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q815ui/review_of_the_dangerous_drugs_soon_to_be_used_for/", "title": "Review of the dangerous drugs.
