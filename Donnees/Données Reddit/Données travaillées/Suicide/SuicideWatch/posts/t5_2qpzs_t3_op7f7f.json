Maybe he was right.\n\nMy older brother had a friend named Ed when I was little. Ed lost his left arm in a motorcycle accident in his early 20s. He dealt with heroin addiction most of his life, until he finally got himself cleaned up. He killed himself with car exhaust a couple years after that.\n\nI was told a man in my extended watched his mom set herself on fire to spite him. My parents knew a guy who watched his brother shoot himself in the head; at least that one was an accident.\n\nI'm going to die someday. I want it to mean something. I can either die in a car accident and go down as a life cut tragically short, or I can pull the trigger myself and leave as one tiny ripple, one more small voice in the back of someone's head saying \"Maybe this life we've built for ourselves isn't worth the trouble, maybe we fucked up.\" \n\nMaybe, if we're lucky, they'll actually try to fix it instead of just waiting for something to change. Maybe they'll be stronger than me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/op7f7f/sorry_for_the_mess/", "title": "Sorry for the Mess", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "xRoflface", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626931379, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/op7f7f/sorry_for_the_mess/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422311.3591645, "replies_charged": false}
