Although I don't have any friends and never had a girl friend, I have tried telling my parents that I still live with how depressed I am. I usually get a 'I'm sick of hearing how depressed you are' response. Tried the doctor, pills A, B, C with no success. I have tried lots of alcohol with much higher than safe doses of some other drug while on purposely stopping short of lethal dose. Later found out this is known as [parasuicide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasuicide). I guess at this point you are probably thinking about what good trolling I'm up too. Not surprising if so as I have overheard girls that I planned to ask out say \"who's that weirdo?\" before getting a chance to initiate conversation. I am loosing my patience with this cruel world at an ever increasing rate and so desperate to depart. I lost my fear of death a long time ago with only a slight concern for causing an irreversible change. I am ready to pay the ultimate price in great desperation to end this pain that is destroying me in my mind.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e2h0h/what_does_it_cost_to_be_taken_seriously/", "title": "What does it cost to be taken seriously?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "prozac_is_crap", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1289136133, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e2h0h/what_does_it_cost_to_be_taken_seriously/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427793.5879827, "replies_charged": false}
