Last year my sister held a (badly disguised) pity party where we ate from a chocolate fountain and watched movies together. I don\u2019t know why this birthday is getting to me so much. Maybe because I\u2019m realising that this is how my life is going to look, forever? And I can\u2019t do it.\n\nI was 16 during my first attempt. 9 years later and not a day goes by where I don\u2019t regret failing. I\u2019ve never been grateful for the second chance and I\u2019ve never let go of the desire to try again. \n\nSomething\u2019s changed. For so long I had told myself I wasn\u2019t allowed to die - the one thing I wanted most in the world, more than anything. It felt so concrete, this unbreakable rule that seemed to be justifying my ongoing existence.\n\nBut now I look around and realise I have no friends, no coworkers, nobody who relies on me. That\u2019s just as well - I\u2019ll never be the friend/sister/daughter/partner anyone deserves. \n\nI\u2019ve deleted my Facebook and Instagram. I quit smoking purely because I couldn\u2019t be bothered anymore. I\u2019ve had these phases in my life before but it\u2019s like I\u2019m always tricked into staying. This time it feels unshakable. \n\nI thought it would get better. Now I see that it will only get worse. My relationships have deteriorated around me, I\u2019m out of options, and the effort/energy it would take to dig myself out of this hole is effort/energy I don\u2019t have. \n\nI\u2019m so tired.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfh47r/to_what_end/", "title": "To what end?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "coolforcatsmp3", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635169627, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfh47r/to_what_end/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423136.428305, "replies_charged": false}
