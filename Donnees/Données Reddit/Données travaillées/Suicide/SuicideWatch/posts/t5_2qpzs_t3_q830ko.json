I wrote her a letter and folded it into an origami envelope. I know this I kinda toxic but I feel like if she rejects me then it might make me want to actually off myself (it's not completely the rejection that will kill me but i'm scared of making things weird or having her hate me because she's really important to me)know if she accepts then I'll feel much better so I decided to take the risk. I'd appreciate any words of encouragement and/or advice.
