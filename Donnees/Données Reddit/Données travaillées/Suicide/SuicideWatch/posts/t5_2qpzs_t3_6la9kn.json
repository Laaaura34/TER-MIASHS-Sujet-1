But it feels like something that's been a long time coming.\n\nThe weather is good, and somewhat enjoyable. The neighbors and their kids are outside, playing, lighting off fireworks while grilling. They seem to be enjoying each other's company, and enjoying being alive. My mom and stepdad are downstairs and I couldn't give half a fuck about them or myself. The gradient which frames my bizarre existence and forces me to see just how much of a fucked up life I've lived is never-ending, so I'm sitting here drinking, playing video games with headphones, pretending the outside world doesn't exist.. as it does. And everything tells me how much better it is for everyone else, although I know it's so much worse for so many people in so many other places. My heart burns for those who will never know what it's like to have clean water, a normal job to work, an opportunity at an education.. and yet, still, I can be completely self-absorbed and narcissistic about what I'm going through as if nobody else ever has or ever will feel the same way. \n\nI could've gone out with friends but I ended up drinking alone, for what seems like the thousandth time. I drank enough that it forced me to take a midday nap which wrecked plans to go out and be somewhat normal, as it always does. Waking up at 6 pm, confused, thinking it's 6 am and you have to get ready for work on a day where you should be spending time with family and friends enjoying America's freedoms is fucking maddening. This shit never stops, but the drinking shuts it off long enough to stop giving a fuck for a few hours so I can make it to tomorrow. That's what my life has become. Drink enough to turn it off momentarily and hope that the future will save me from the present. I know this is ludicrous, literally idiotic and borderline insane, but the PTSD is wearing my sensibility thin and I don't know how much more I can take. Hyper vigilance is excruciating; I feel like fucking Donnie, waiting for the engine to fall off the plane and crash through the roof while I half-grin that fucked up face of death's acceptance. Except I feel like that in every waking hour.. if I'm not drunk or asleep adrenaline is pumping through me, fight or flight, whether I like it or not. I can't turn it off and it's been 15 years. FIFTEEN YEARS OF ADRENALINE. Fuck. It's fun when an ex-marine tells you they've literally *never* heard of a civilian case of it. Yep, sorry man, that's how fucked up my childhood was and how damaging it was and still is to me. \n\n*I am Jack's Dysfunctional Existence.*\n\nI got up and immediately thought of the 9mm in my bedside table. If it wasn't for the mess it would make, and the debts I'd leave behind for my mom and stepdad to have to handle, it doesn't seem like such a bad idea. It'd probably be a small funeral, a lot of people saying 'Yeah, I mean we saw it coming. He went through a lot of shit'. Nobody says anything until it's too late, such is the way of the world, and then things move on. It is as it always should've been. So I came here instead, because I know I need to purge these thoughts before they take hold. But it's fucking terrifying; they've never had this much power over me. Is this the beginning of the end, or the end that leads to a new beginning?\n\nSome days are amazing, and I can enjoy everything life has to offer. But most days are like today, where I can't see beyond the frustration, the mistakes, the pain, the drama. No helpful network of people, no family that gives a shit until it's too late, no friends that want to get involved because of the work it would take, no girlfriend that wants to deal with someone who's so far gone and out of touch. I am like you, and you are like me, and somehow we commiserate blindly, anonymously, and for a moment understand each other. Then time takes hold, things change, and as always I end up left behind. Lost. Forgotten. Useless to the world, unable to contribute, unable to even fucking care about anyone or anything.. myself included. On a day where we should be celebrating independence, for all the fucking shit that people have gone through to give us this, to get us here, I can only think about myself. It fucking disgusts me.\n\nHow is it possible for someone to simultaneously feel so much hate and so much love? \n\nIs this narrative worth it?\n\nSorry for the wall. I have nowhere else to go.\n\n/rant\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6la9kn/the_carousel_without_amusement/", "title": "The carousel, without amusement", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hyper_vigilant", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1499208216, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6la9kn/the_carousel_without_amusement/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425166.0873413, "replies_charged": false}
