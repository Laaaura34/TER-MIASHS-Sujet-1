I don\u2019t lash out anymore or self harm or really abuse alcohol or drugs or various other things to feel something like I used to, but if i was an emotional wreck back then i\u2019m now an emotionless one. The sometimes overwhelming and always constant feelings of loneliness never left me but that\u2019s about all I feel nowadays, and even though I used to do some fucked up shit I still felt something, whether it be pain or sadness or a whole range of emotions. Now i just feel empty, and when I decided to change my life and take me off a path which was inevitably leading to suicide, I sure didn\u2019t think this is where I\u2019d be today. My insecurities about being alone and having no one who cares whether it be family or friends have grown massively to the point where I\u2019ve sorta just accepted that this is how it\u2019s going to be. In a post I wrote back then I said i was afraid of eventually pushing everyone away, now i\u2019m afraid they\u2019re just gunna leave. People who know me see me as being \u201cbetter\u201d because I\u2019m no longer the guy who would get black out drunk and end up hurting himself or the ones around him, but tbh I haven\u2019t sorted my issues out at all, i\u2019m just better at hiding them even better than before. It\u2019s not that I want to die, trust me I\u2019ve been there and I know i never wanna go back to that, but I don\u2019t wanna feel like this but the thing I have no idea what to do. Back at the start I had clear issues which I could deal with better (e.g don\u2019t abuse alcohol at every opportunity), but now I have more different issues which are just as painful and make me just as sad. I know i\u2019m just in my own head and its not real but honestly I don\u2019t even know anymore. I think i\u2019m pretty good at picking up on things and that coupled with my fucked up thoughts all in my head create scenarios and illusions, but it gets harder and harder to tell whats real and whats not, and so ultimately I guess i\u2019ve been through so much pain and hurt that i just automatically have accepted i\u2019m alone and no one truly cares about me just to end that suffering, and it just sucks a lot. Sometimes i wonder if life was better back when i was too fucked up and unstable to care about who loves me or whatever, because I didn\u2019t plan on living much longer, or if I actually successfully killed myself, then none of this would matter. But suicide is not an option and its not like i don\u2019t wanna feel better and feel loved but i don\u2019t see any light at the end of this tunnel just empty, lonely darkness.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/odzfif/lost_soul/", "title": "Lost Soul", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RandomGuy30000", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625458051, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/odzfif/lost_soul/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425176.2194366, "replies_charged": false}
