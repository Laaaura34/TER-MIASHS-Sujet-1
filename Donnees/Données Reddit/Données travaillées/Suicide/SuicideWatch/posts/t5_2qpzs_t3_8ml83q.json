I knew he was suicidal..I just didn't realize how bad it was.\nI know it's not my fault, but I still have those evil little thoughts. They pop up and say \"you killed him. You didn't do enough\". They say \"it wasn't you he loved. You were not important enough to make him stay\".\nI don't want children, but something about him made me want them. After he left, I was terrified I could actually be pregnant. I wasn't. And now I see happy couples with their children at the store and I want to break down.\nI'm so sick. I have the worst thoughts of wanting to die so we can be together again, in a time and place without all the circumstances that played a role in his death.\nAnd I feel so alone. I AM alone in my grief. I have no one to commiserate with. I didn't really know any of his new friends. His old friends, I don't want to bother. I feel like all my friends are tired of hearing it.\nI'm heartbroken. I'm bitter. So fucking bitter. How could you leave me here on my own?? You got to end your pain and I'm still stuck here, even more miserable than before.
