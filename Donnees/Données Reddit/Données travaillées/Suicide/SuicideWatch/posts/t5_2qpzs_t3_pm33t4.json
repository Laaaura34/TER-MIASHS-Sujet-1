I have really low self-esteem and so many insecurities. I hate everything about myself: my height, my race, my face, my personality, my lack of talent... everything. \n\nI'm thinking of buying bleach at my local Coles and drinking it. I'm really scared of the pain, but I'm sick of existing now. I read on the Internet that around 200mL is enough for a lethal dose.\n\nI've tried hanging myself before but it's pretty difficult in my room. My room doesn't have a hook to do that in, and I dont have rope. I've also thought of cutting myself (I used to self-harm a lot), but I've heard that to kill yourself you'd have to cut quite deep. \n\nSo, yeah. That's what I'm thinking.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pm33t4/buying_bleach/", "title": "Buying bleach", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kwonichiwa", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631346239, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pm33t4/buying_bleach/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427447.229011, "replies_charged": false}
