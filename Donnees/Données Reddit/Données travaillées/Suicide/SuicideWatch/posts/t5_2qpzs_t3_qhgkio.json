I'm such a shitty waste of space that I can only imagine people only interact with me out of pity. I'm not stupid, I know when I'm being lied to. sure, I can maybe believe that my family cares, but thats cause they don't know me, not really. they are predisposed to love me because I'm their family, not because I'm worth loving. If I killed myself, I think I'd be helping my family in the long run. One less mouth to feed, one less child to worry about. My parents spend so much time paying attention to me and my mental health that I'm worried my siblings aren't being given the attention they need. if I die, maybe everyone can finally be happy. I hate this, knowing nobody wants me. My best friend abandoned me, and I used to be mad, but now I get it. I deserved it. I deserved to be left behind. Fuck, I just wanna do everyone a favor and off myself tonight.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhgkio/im_not_worth_the_effort/", "title": "I'm not worth the effort", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "grape_lad", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635401890, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhgkio/im_not_worth_the_effort/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423126.386461, "replies_charged": false}
