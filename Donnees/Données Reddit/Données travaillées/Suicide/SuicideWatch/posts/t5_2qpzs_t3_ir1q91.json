She's very impulsive and has a lot of self destructive behavior. I'm not a professional, but I think it's important to mention that she also displays almost all symptoms of borderline personality disorder, but I'm not diagnosing her by any means.\n\nShe lives in a middle eastern country, so she has extremely limited access to help and everything mental health related is super taboo. She can't turn to anyone irl for help. She has no friends other than me, and her family is abusive. She keeps everything hidden from them, since they have in the past reacted to this with anger and violence. Talking to anyone other than me both irl and online sends her into a panic attack. \n\nI've seen a few suicide hotline numbers for the country she lives in, however that would involve the cops coming to her house and with the way her family is it definitely wouldn't end well. Psych wards and whatnot are incredibly neglectful. \n\nI talk to her a lot, and I always make sure to listen to her and be there for her. But I'm not sure what else I can do.\n\nAre there any online services that may be helpful? What can I do immediately for her? Any general advice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ir1q91/i_need_urgent_advice_for_my_online_friend_with/", "title": "I need urgent advice for my online friend with limited options", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mado2ki", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1599866821, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ir1q91/i_need_urgent_advice_for_my_online_friend_with/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428497.4135618, "replies_charged": false}
