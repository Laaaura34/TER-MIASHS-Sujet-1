I've never told anyone, because well.. I've never actually considered it, it was more of like a mood sometimes? Like, when I saw a train enter the station, I would often think about well.. just tripping. Or when I'd be up in a stair well too, it'd just be.. pretty easy.\n\nBut those were all very fleeting ideas, things I thought when i was in a bad mood, and I never actually got too close to the line so to speak, but lately, everything's just gone completely upside down. I'm having an identity crisis, I can't figure out what to do with my future (or rather, I basically only have one other option left besides well, this), and it's just all so.. bad.\n\nCurrently there are two things still holding me back, one is a very special friend of mine, and the other are my hobbies, however both of these things are getting further and further away. I haven't seen my friend for half a year now, and while we do chat as often as we can, it's just nowhere near the same.\n\nMy hobbies feel like a drop on the hot stone, but whenever I'm not occupied, without noise, or just.. with nothing happening around me, I can't help but think about it. It's been on my mind constantly, I've been awake in my bed for multiple nights at a time.\n\nI don't even know the exact reason for my feelings, I just have a really hard time finding lasting joy in anything anymore.\n\nAnd as I mentioned before, when I thought about it in the past, it was always some very distant thing that could never seriously happen, but now.. It almost feels like I actually feel it happening. I'm having dreams, not nightmares, where I feel it slowly happening. It's rarely painful and more of a relief usually. I've caught myself thinking up who I'd have to notify before doing it, just to do them justice, so they don't think I'm just ghosting them. \n\nI need help but I'm too scared to get it, how do you stop yourselves from doing it?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q6xoxm/how_do_i_keep_going/", "title": "How do I keep going?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ThrowawayA13V3", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634078957, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q6xoxm/how_do_i_keep_going/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635427642.116302, "replies_charged": false}
