I've been thinking about killing myself for a while but mainly just as a way to comfort myself. My dad hates me. I don't have a mom. My grandma who raised me has a tumor in the spine. I've been taking medication for anxiety, depression and insomnia since June but it has been getting worse. I haven't slept in 28 hours. I'm failing every single class as I can't focus. I've been planning this since last week. I decided that today I'm killing myself. My plan was to wait till my dad goes to sleep and take a shit ton of pills, whatever I can find. I did my research and apparently 20-25g of paracetamol should do the trick. Maybe I'll mix it up with something else like ibuprofen and take all my antidepressants too. I really don't know what else to do with my life. Playing videogames used to make me happy, taking care of my little brother too, going for walks, playing the guitar, the piano, but nothing motivates me anymore. I had a heart surgery last year that just keeps me in pain. I should be dead.
