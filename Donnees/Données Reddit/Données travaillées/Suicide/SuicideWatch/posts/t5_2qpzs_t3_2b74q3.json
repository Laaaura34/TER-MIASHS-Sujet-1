Recently though, things have been getting worse. I have horrrible intrusive, racing thoughts. I'm more irrational and irritable than usual towards the people I care about. There are certain things in my romantic relationship that cause me great distress and anxiety, a result of an abusive ex. Lately these things are causing me to act out irrationally. It's like I lose myself and do things without realizing what I'm doing. I've started cutting again. My eating disorder was getting better until my boyfriend betrayed me. Now I'm trying to move on in our relationship but the racing thoughts get really bad something because of what happened. I've been throwing up at least twice a day now and I haven't kept anything down for more than two days. I think about slitting my wrists constantly. How it would look, how it would feel, if I would be found in time to survive, and if I would want to be found or not. I'm fixated on suicide because I don't know how to live like this anymore. Just when I thought maybe things would be better, they got worse. I can't wake up to this anymore. And the only think I can think to do is to kill myself. Please help.
