Had new friends at work that share the same passion as me in traveling. Met a lot of good people too along the way. But it all went down when my manager started to emotionally abuse us. I remember crying at night remembering all the things he have said to me. Had to endure for months when I decided to leave because it was taking a toll on my mental health.\n\nMy family would always talk me out of it because they wanted me to leave if I have a replacement job before resigning. But I can't take it anymore. They're more disappointed now cause I don't have a job and when I try to explain to them the reason why I left, instead of consoling me, they're blaming me for not being strong enough to stand up to him and would always say that every job I will encounter will be the same. They don't understand why I am depressed at a young age when I haven't seen most of the world yet. Is it wrong for me to feel this way? \n\nI'm hopeless. I have a lot of friends and family but they never actually ask me if how I am doing or if I am fine after leaving. That's why I never had anyone to talk to about my feelings. Every single day I feel like the life I'm living is useless. I'm easily hurt whenever someone would reprimand me and would cry nonstop to relieve it. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I don't have the motivation to fix it and I don't have any emotional support. I'm drowning myself to self pity. \n\nEvery time I cry, suicide would always come up as a solution for ending things. But every time I look at my nephew, i can't do it because I don't want him to experience the trauma. He's too young for that. He is the only one that keeps me at bay and I'm thankful for that.\n\nI'm 23F btw, am I too young to be feeling this way just after having one job? Do you guys experienced this also? And how did you cope up and manage to live life again?
