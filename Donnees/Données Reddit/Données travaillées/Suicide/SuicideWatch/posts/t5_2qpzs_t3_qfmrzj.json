I'm 52, and I don't want or have any desire to live.  I'm not happy,  I'm tired of living,  and I don't enjoying being alive.  I don't have nothing to live for,  and I'm just existing,  occupying a space and I don't see no reason to live for.  I could kill myself of course,  but I don't want to be found by my son or anyone. I want to seat in a nice,  comfortable chair,  have a drink,  and get my injection,  going in a deep sleep and not wake up.  If I try to kill myself,  anything can go wrong and I can end paralyzed or in a vegetative situation.  I  want to be sure that if die,  that's for sure that I don't have any chances of surviving.  I'm an adult,  I know what I want,  and I can sign a legal paper,  saying that I know what I'm signing for ...its so difficult or expensive,  if I choose for that outcome? Why it's so difficult or impossible to do it like so? Its my life, my body,  my choice.  No one will be responsible for my death besides me.  What makes it so difficult to accept and understand? I'm so tired of this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfmrzj/why_we_cant_choose_when_we_want_to_die/", "title": "Why we can't choose when we want to die???", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mybackpainreally", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635185574, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfmrzj/why_we_cant_choose_when_we_want_to_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427419.0449893, "replies_charged": false}
