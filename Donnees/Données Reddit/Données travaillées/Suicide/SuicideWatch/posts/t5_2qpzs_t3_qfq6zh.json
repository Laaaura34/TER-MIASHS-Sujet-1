Now I live on my own and I have all this stuff to manage and I'd rather die. I feel so pathetic because I'm afraid to make appointments and leave the house. I just wanna overdose but they're only giving me medication a week at a time. Also the longer off work I am, the guiltier I feel and the more terrified I am to go back.
