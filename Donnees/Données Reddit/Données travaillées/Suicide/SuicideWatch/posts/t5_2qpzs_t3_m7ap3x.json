It\u2019s so frustrating. No one ever visits me, I live on my own & am able to do whatever I want.\nI keep thinking about overdosing and seriously injuring myself. I know I should probably get myself admitted to the psych ward if I\u2019m feeling suicidal but my brain tells me that no one will take me seriously unless I do something to harm myself. I\u2019m kinda afraid I\u2019m actually going to hurt myself because I keep thinking about it. I don\u2019t want to but I might give in if this keeps going on..\n\nNot only that, I also struggle with bulimia and I\u2019m broke. I literally have 7 cents on my bank account and really can\u2019t afford to be throwing up and wasting food but it\u2019s hard to control it. I could also give myself permanent heart damage if I don\u2019t get help.\nPlus nothing feels real to me anymore. I feel as if I live in a shitty videogame and everyone around me (including me) feels fake. I think I might be going insane.. and all the ptsd flashbacks. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to handle this for much longer\n\nThis has been going on for years & has only gotten worse so is it really worth trying to get help again and bothering everyone? I dunno.\n\nTbh, all I really want is for someone to cuddle with me and play with my hair and tell me everything is going to be okay. Is that too much to ask for? But everyone has became so cold towards me and it affects me a lot.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m7ap3x/my_brain_tells_me_that_no_one_will_take_me/", "title": "My brain tells me that no one will take me seriously unless I do something stupid to seriously harm myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "achickenugget", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616015247, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m7ap3x/my_brain_tells_me_that_no_one_will_take_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422929.5978773, "replies_charged": false}
