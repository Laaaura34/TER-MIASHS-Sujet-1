I\u2019d always been chronically lonely so I was overjoyed at first, but now two and a half years later much of the relationship has gone toxic and I have nobody there for me if I leave it. I\u2019d be alone, and honestly that\u2019s the one thing worse than keeping this up.\n\nI\u2019ve had a history of suicidal behavior and self harm and have gone through a lot of work to get better at both. But these past few months have been so miserable that the only way I\u2019m able to keep from killing myself I feel like is going to work and going to sleep.\n\nLast night I had a dream in which my life was much more like how I wished it were. Waking up now to realize it\u2019s no different, the only thing keeping me from trying to hang myself is that I think I\u2019d get caught before the attempt was complete", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/en8e7g/23_f_my_biggest_regret_is_prioritizing_my/", "title": "(23 F) My biggest regret is prioritizing my relationship before my friendship.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sadassthrowaway420", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1578754836, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/en8e7g/23_f_my_biggest_regret_is_prioritizing_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425255.909281, "replies_charged": false}
