The knowledge that I could always kill myself gave me comfort, gave me an excuse to not deal with my trauma, my problems, the future. Why try to heal, why build something if I was surely going to die by the end of the year? I live every day in a foggy state of mind. The years pass me by like days, I know that if I can't change now, I'll end up old and bitter without having lived a single day of my life. I go to therapy, I try to change. There's a part of me that hates me for being alive and screams insults at everything I do, protests that I still dare to breathe. There's another part of me, maybe scarier than the first, that rejoices at the thought of being dead. A rational part of me recognizes these entities as a part of me that developed so I could survive. And then there are these thoughts I recognize as my own in the middle of that circle, terrified of what that means. It means I can't hide anymore. It means I have to wake up.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pevfd9/im_25_now_and_i_should_stop_kidding_myself_im_not/", "title": "I'm 25 now and I should stop kidding myself: I'm not going to kill myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BirthedByNoOne", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 100, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630371642, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pevfd9/im_25_now_and_i_should_stop_kidding_myself_im_not/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425329.6137514, "replies_charged": false}
