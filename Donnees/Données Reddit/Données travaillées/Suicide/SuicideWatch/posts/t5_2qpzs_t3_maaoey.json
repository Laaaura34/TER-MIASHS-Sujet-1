I am glad it didn\u2019t but the reason I did was because my dad said I couldn\u2019t get on hormone blockers and that I would have to wait a while to get on testosterone. This made my depression even worse. The day after the suicide didn\u2019t work I tried overdosing on Tylenol but that didn\u2019t work either. I am glad I got this off my chest but I really am insecure because I\u2019m trans and don\u2019t think I pass very well so having to wait for testosterone without going to blockers is hard for me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/maaoey/tried_committing_suicide_a_couple_days_ago/", "title": "Tried committing suicide a couple days ago", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PinkLov", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616373960, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/maaoey/tried_committing_suicide_a_couple_days_ago/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428373.719086, "replies_charged": false}
