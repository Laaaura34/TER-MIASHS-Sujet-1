Every year autumn saddens me, but this time...\n\nI am almost 40, software developer. Lost my job on August, the company laid us off, so I was not the only one. I applied to some companies and two of them kind of told me that I am not the most brilliant developer around. I dealt with it.\n\nAutumn started. An acquaintance recommended me for a job at the company he's working. I took it, no tech interviews, I began on November. My coworkers are nice and all, but I still feel them very condescending. My direct coworker has told me at least twice that the code I've done had to be removed.\n\nI feel useless. I feel that I am not good at anything. My family and partner insist I am a good developer, how can they know? They support me, of course, but that doesn't turn me any smart(er).\n\nOn the other hand, I notice since some months that I actually don't have real friends. I have friends with whom I spend some time when they have the time for me. We never do things together, we just go for drinks or a movie, they have their actual real friends with whom they actually do things together, like sport, traveling, etc.\n\nThe last week, specially on the weekend I am only feeling that I keep alive as a favor to my family and my partner, who love me and would suffer if I die. But I am tired of living. I thought in going to a secluded monastery.. Rationally thinking is costing me much energies\n\nTLDR; I am an aging coward, afraid of commiseration and self pity", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1rwk17/autumn_again_like_every_year_i_feel_like_shit_but/", "title": "Autumn again, like every year I feel like shit, but this time is unbearable", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "aging_coward", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1385980296, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1rwk17/autumn_again_like_every_year_i_feel_like_shit_but/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425166.4805946, "replies_charged": false}
