I wanted to post this on a subredit where I would get more unbiased answers. But apparently, due to the taboo nature of the subject, nobody else will allow it. So I wish to clarify that I'm only looking for straight-forward answers. If you think I should kill myself, be honest and tell me.\n\nOut of context:  \nI'm 30 years old,  live with my parents, no girlfriend (not interested  anyways), no  friends (also not interested), and no job. I left my last  job in 2015  (retail associate) to pursue a degree in electrical  engineering. I'll  soon have an associates degree, only.\n\nIn context:  \n(The  following is a short summary of my life experience, including theories  about how I ended up like this, constructed during years of isolation - I  know 99% aren't going to read all this mundane shit, but as the second  header states this section is \"in context\". Though admittedly, the  majority of the most important aspects are withheld for the sake of  brevity. I wrote this sincerely because I am contemplating suicide - it  is not attention seeking in any way.)\n\nearly   childhood: strong indication of mental health problems. Erratic   behavior, emotionally unstable, isolationist, nhilistic ideals, possibly   autistic.  \nEarliest  memory is of a group of teenagers who formed a  circle around me and  started pushing me, calling me names. I spat on  one of the kids and he  picked me up by my neck and started strangling  me. I blacked out, and  when I woke up a woman was yelling and the kids  were running the other  way. She asked me if I was okay and I ran home. A  couple years later my  family moved to another neighborhood -  apparently due to repeated  bullying that I still don't remember.\n\nAfter   piecing together the events, I've come to the realization that the   reason why I was bullied was because of my appearance. Though I lived in   a low-income neighborhood, I was dressed up as though I came from an   upper-class family. I believe this is why I was targeted. As a result, I   believe I developed an unhealthy fixation with appearances, and spent   the majority of my time modifying my appearance and cloaking my   personality to get people to like me (it worked). From what I can   remember, this behavior started at around the age of 7-10 years old.\n\nBy   the end of high school I was very popular. I had a girlfriend, and   several friends who would later realize I was a phony. I was very good   at pretending to be someone else, but eventually the veil was lifted. I   was tired of keeping up false appearances by that point, anyways. I had   been doing it for years, and I had an entire library of lies memorized   by that point, and the number of lies I'd have to commit to memory  kept  growing.\n\nAfter my girlfriend  got  pregnant (post high-school graduation), I was done with the  facade. She  got an abortion (by my suggestion - I wasn't ready to be a  father for  obvious reasons) and I began a 3 year period in which I  isolated myself.  In this period of time, I lost contact with everyone. I  know you might  think this isn't possible because I live with my  parents. However, my  dad worked 80 hours a week, my mom was there when  she wasn't working but  considered me to be a burden. As a result, the  most social contact I  would get would be my mom knocking on my door  maybe, once a month,  asking if I was \"still alive\".\n\nI   had access to video game consoles, computers, and internet  from an  early age. Located in my bedroom, which I never left during this  time.  Though I mostly spent the three months during summer vacations  gaming,  this became my activity of choice, morning day and night for  nearly 2  years.\n\nHowever, the  stimulation I  felt from gaming gradually dwindled, and the amount of  pleasure I  derived from any activity-even masturbation-became equivalent  to  watching the seconds hand shift positions on an analogue clock.  After  the second year, I began sleeping 15 hours or more per day. The  rest of  the day beyond this point was spent, mostly in bed, thinking  about  life and trying to piece things together. I knew I had to change,  but I  didn't know how.\n\nMy first   instinct was to get a job, so I did. I got a job in the tech department   of a retail store called Meijer. At first, I worked on third shift.  When  I moved to first shift, the damage done by the 3 years I had spent  in  isolation was very apparent. I had difficulty looking people in the   eyes, and every time I spoke, I stuttered. My hair was long and ratty,   and hung in front of my face. I also panicked and had anxiety attacks   constantly. As a result, I received a lot of complaints from customers   and only kept my job by convincing the manager that it wasn't a  problem.\n\nI  began using drugs, via  a man I met in another department, who sold  percocets and marijuana.  This I won't get into, but lets just say that  this was my first brush  with attempted suicide. I realized then that drugs didn't  mix with me  very well.\n\nAfter  getting off the  drugs I regained my confidence. During my time in the  photo printing  department, I fixed the job-management software using  elementary  knowledge of PowerShell. Impressed by this, my coworkers told  me I  should go to college - so I did.\n\nSince   I wasn't a particularly good student my first time around, I decided  to  take it slow. I eventually worked my way up to full-time classes (up  to  16 credit hours per semester), and I was very serious about my  studies.  I maintained a 4.0 gpa after 72 credit hours, all paid for in  full via  pel grants and scholarships, up until 2017 when I got into a  car wreck  (with an inanimate object) due to a stress-related incident. I  was placed on 2 years probation and required to attend mental health  treatment for the duration.\n\nAt the   end of 2019, my therapy was over. The treatment appeared to be   effective, and my depression seemed to be abating. But the first year or   so was a very steep uphill battle. I realized that I still wanted to   pursue engineering, and felt a lot better about myself. At the end of   2020 (just a week ago) I received a scholarship from the community   college I attended. They noticed I had only one semester left to   complete my degree, and offered to pay for my tuition fees in full. I   accepted.\n\nDuring 2019/2020 I spent   most of my time learning how to code in C and re-learning calculus,   differential equations and circuit analysis via certificate courses to   prep me for university. As I started to work again towards my goals, I   began to question my job prospects. As a result, I started googling   things about what prospective employers look for in potential job   candidates.\n\nAll I've learned is   that my prospects in life are now, slim to none and I feel like in the   eyes of society I have shamed myself beyond redemption. Being 30 and   living with your parents is normally perceived as a mortal sin. I've   spent the past few days reading articles about 30 year olds living with   their parents etc. and it's starting to sink in how poorly my life will   be received by others. I'm getting the idea that I'll never get a job  as  an engineer, so the degree I pursued was pointless.  I also am  starting  to feel humiliation and regret for even being alive.\n\nI   wrote this because I wanted to address those feelings directly, like I   was taught via CBT. Not simply in the hope that I might get the answer  that I want, but to know the truth. I figured a good way to do this is  by asking people what they think about me and how I've lived my life. Am  I completely worthless, and do you think I should kill myself?\n\nRegards,\n\nMike M.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kghewc/i_am_a_30_year_old_male_with_a_history_of/", "title": "I am a 30 year old male with a history of suicidal behavior.
