I texted the suicide/crisis line and had a brief conversation with someone explaining the awful state of mind I\u2019m in and somehow they must have deemed me \u201cnot a risk to myself\u201d because they told me to do something to calm my brain down like take a shower and that was the end. \n\nSo now I\u2019m here, feeling like I desperately want to kill myself. Truly, if I didn\u2019t have my cat I would have probably done it a long time ago. I wish I had people like my cat in my life. \n\nThanks for listening.
