Wake up, listen to music to distract myself from my thoughts, learn korean for an hour and just sit there do nothing and when I feel like the music isn't helping I take some time to look at paintings by my favourite painters. \nUsually I can handle this shit after having my mental reset by visiting my favourite places in the summer in my home country but covid fucked that up for 2 years and I couldn't afford it in 2019 so I think of suicide more frequently.\n\nI'm just getting closer and closer and honestly the music and paintings don't help as much anymore, I'm just tired of waking up feeling like a piece of shit because I'm to socially anxious to go and get a job.\n\nI'm bored af so I want to try death for the first and last time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qdpdbs/i_wish_boredom_could_kill/", "title": "I wish boredom could kill", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LatvianPrick", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634934003, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qdpdbs/i_wish_boredom_could_kill/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426996.9295008, "replies_charged": false}
