No, this is not some cognitive distortion, I don't want any patronising CBT bullshit, I do not have social anxiety, I'm actually very good in social situations and have been told so many times. But as an alcoholic (sober for a few months now) I have humiliated myself so much. \n\nI know this sounds like such a trivial thing to get suicidal over but it's been every second of every hour of every day for about a year now and I can never enjoy anything because I am CONSTANTLY ruminating over all my humiliations. It's really sad because I've had so many potentially beautiful experiences ruined by this incessant rumination. Even when having sex I cringe.\n\nI looked up online about how to deal with it but every article is pretty much: 'Have you tried *not* ruminating?' 'Just stop ruminating!' 'Think of happy thoughts!' 'When you start ruminating... Why not stop?'\n\n... Jesus fucking Christ if only it was that fucking easy. I cannot carry on for long like this, even while typing this my mind is constantly reminding of what a moron I've been in my life.
