I just feel unloved even though I have a boyfriend, good friends and family. I don't know if I can keep going on any longer. I always have the thought of killing myself at least once every week since the beginning of September. I'm afraid to ask for help because I may seem weak. I've always been the happy, cheery friend of the group and I don't want this to change the way my friends look at me. Only my boyfriend knows about these thoughts that I have, yet I feel like he isn't trying hard enough. It feels like he doesn't love me as much to care about my well being. The world is already a fucked up place and without me, it would be one less person contributing to the carbon footprint or one less mouth the feed or one less child to educate (for my parents). I dont know what to do tbh. I'm just so done with everything. I dont have the energy to live anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dj0gqj/should_i_do_it/", "title": "Should I do it?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway_160401", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1571282002, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dj0gqj/should_i_do_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426696.49817, "replies_charged": false}
