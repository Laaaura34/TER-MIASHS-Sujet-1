Some people I said I would see them tomorrow or that we should really meet up soon.\n\nI wrote down all of the things I would miss about living. I told them I was sorry. I told them I felt guilty about leaving too soon. But then I told them I feel guilty for being such a burden all the time. My longterm boyfriend told me that I'm the reason he gets angry and for the first time I didn't have it in me to argue.\n\nI'm the reason my mom cries when I don't answer the phone. I'm the reason my friends always check my arms for fresh marks. I'm so tired of feeling responsible for them. I think we'd all feel a lot better if I was just gone.\n\nI am going to miss birthday cake and ice cream. Sunsets. I am sad for the first dates I will never go on and the first kisses that might have followed. I will miss my cat. I will miss trashy reality TV shows.\n\nBut I will not miss feeling sad. I will not miss hospitals and emergency rooms. I will not miss therapy appointments and \"hold on pain ends\" posters. I will not miss locking myself in the bathroom with a pair of scissors. I will not miss crying myself to sleep.\n\nI hope they know I love them. \n\nI hope they know how hard I tried.\n\nEDIT:\nCalled mom and a friend. Talked it out for a while. Ignored loser boyfriend for most of the night. Didn't have the heart to throw the note away. Can't sleep now. \n\nThere's a lot going on. Dropped out of college, switching therapists, fired from my job. It's all falling apart at once.\n\nI'm just trying to get to tomorrow. Thank you for seeing me.
