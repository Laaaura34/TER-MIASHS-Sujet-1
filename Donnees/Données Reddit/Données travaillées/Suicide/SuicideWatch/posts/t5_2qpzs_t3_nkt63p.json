My mind, the cognition of how I think, and how I feel time to time can be misunderstood, misinterpreted, or completely disregarded because of poor perception from others. Some are from people who are close to me, but a lot of the times it\u2019s inadvertent and I don\u2019t personally take offense to anything they say. Somedays, I just feel very beaten down, trying to find purpose in existence and my own as a whole, and trying to not be portrayed or painted as someone who\u2019s \u201cedgy\u201d and wants to garner attention. \n\nSometimes I make things worse for myself, by being hyper fixated on things that take up my time as of recent. I want to create an habitual process where I won\u2019t get so caught up in everything everyone is doing, or get so upset and fazed, that the vague thoughts I get revolving suicidal thoughts permeating heavily; and so excessively. Realistically, it\u2019s about assisting yourself, based on what people try to give you as support, and I try to take their suggestions as a source of benefit. Sometimes, you can\u2019t, because it doesn\u2019t align with your issues that\u2019s exacerbating your will to live. It is difficult to find \u201ccommon ground\u201d and reliance in people to some extent. \n\nMental illness is sensationalized, and those who don\u2019t understand how it is, pervade on the concept of what depression is, and how it can create so much disfigurements in the brain. There\u2019s so much intricate context I could delve into, but it would take forever. \n\nJust somedays, with all I\u2019ve said so far, you just simply don\u2019t want to get up at whatever time you choose to sleep. It\u2019s so debilitating, and distorting. Having Autism makes me think differently. I have faith, I just need to find ways to keep that stagnant.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nkt63p/have_you_had_those_days_where_you_wake_up_and/", "title": "Have you had those days where you wake up and wish you didn\u2019t?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "opaque777", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621958421, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nkt63p/have_you_had_those_days_where_you_wake_up_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428115.4845378, "replies_charged": false}
