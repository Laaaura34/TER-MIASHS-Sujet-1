Ever since the doctor ripped me off Prozac cold turkey last year, my memory has been so bad. I can't even remember where I'm at, how old I am and my own phone number or address. Doctors tell me that you're a memory will come back, but found out from another doctor that because of the incompetent psychiatrist pulling me off Prozac cold turkey... That it caused permanent brain damage. I'm tired of forgetting everything and I can't even multitask anymore because I get stressed. Right now I'm in Target and I'm forget what I'm supposed to buy, this is no type of life. I'm just so sick and tired of doctors not taking chronic illnesses seriously. The either think you're a drug addict, drug seeking, faking it or just mentally unstable and you're making up your symptoms. I am terrified of going to doctors and I rather fucking die than be admitted impatient ever again. That was the most traumatic shit I've ever went through my life.I'm tired of this memory, it will never get better. Then people laugh at me because I'm going around in circles because I don't remember when I'm supposed to get.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qe7ma7/i_just_cant_take_this_memory_loss_anymore_im/", "title": "I just can't take this memory loss anymore, I'm better off dead", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SquareRecording5708", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635004966, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qe7ma7/i_just_cant_take_this_memory_loss_anymore_im/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425435.9039137, "replies_charged": false}
