I wasn't interested in the act of suicide, just the complete vanishing of myself from the world.  A powerwashing of my existence.  I don't want to hurt anyone, past, present or future, but just POOF, gone.  If I had a switch, a button, I'd press it, if I knew it wouldn't affect people.  I've lived most of my life for others, not knowing that's what I was doing.  I hoped and thought sometimes that I was a good person, decent, moral, principled.  Trying to show myself the good in people in general, by exhibiting it myself.  More recently, I'm starting to worry that I was doing it less and less for the good of it all, but to give myself purpose.  Which, I think, is selfish and not what I want to be, and is no longer working anyway.  I remember when I was younger, when I wasn't entertaining people, or helping people, I felt incredibly empty.  I yearned to hurt, because that was better than empty.  Well, I now have that hurt, and I'd prefer the emptiness for a bit.  Grass is greener.  \n\nI haven't had a particularly difficult life.  I typically minimize my struggles, but I think, objectively, it's been ok.  I had pretty caring parents, emotionally abusive to each other, and us kids by proxy, alcoholics for a bit of time growing up, but not outwardly terrible.  I took the role of my mom's savior, doing what I could to make her as happy as I could, while also never being too overly attached.  I walked a line, I guess to make myself not feel and see what I was doing, or to feel that I had my own identity.  I carried that over to friends, and when I turned an adult, my siblings as well.  Taking all my power to be funny, helpful, to be something they didn't get elsewhere.  I struggled with depression, but some of me wanted to feel worse, to know the depths.  Rock bottom had to be somewhere, and if I hit it, maybe I could know what I had and go back to it.  I married someone that I truly love, but I'm not sure where our relationship started and ended with my need to be a hero.  She has severe PTSD, DID, and everything that comes with that, including physical issues from her trauma.  She's also the strongest person I've ever met, and will likely ever meet.  I took my role as giving her what she was never given, someone who cared and loved and fought for her very seriously.  I did it pretty well too for a period of time.\n\nI've always put a lot of pressure on myself to be better than others.  Not in a judgmental way necessarily, but to be stronger, more able, smarter.  Don't trip or jump into the same pitfalls.  Don't take others for granted.  Treat people well.  Be able to handle life.  Be able to handle it all.  Brains are able of truly remarkable things.  I can surely sort these things out.  I started to slide. I was married, with a beautiful dog, had a solid job, and wanted to become better.  I saw flaws in myself.  I saw the hero role, the fixer, and wanted to work on that.  I saw the depression I was struggling with, but had an ok handle on.  WELL, I CAN SORT THAT OUT.  I slid further. Eating behaviors that were always a bit of an issue became an ISSUE.  A very worrying trend indeed.  I would binge, sometimes purge, sleep, restrict, and work.  That was it.  I gained a lot of weight, beginning to unravel.  Sought medical help, trying my hardest to not beat myself up for asking for help.  Med after med, therapy session after therapy session, meditation, breathing, different type of therapy, brain zaps, ketamine, coping skills, exercise, diet, take things one at a time, take things less seriously, take important things more seriously, keep busy, make friends, don't make enemies, POSITIVE THOUGHTS, opposite action, know you're not the only one, life gets better, you don't have a reason to feel this bad, one day at a time, one hour at a time, hobbies, don't listen to sad music, don't watch sad things, don't read about the world, don't be a burden, don't look in the mirror, don't isolate, try vegetables, KETO, avoid toxic relationships, try this one more time, dodge, dip, duck, dive, and dodge.  \n\nI've always been fighting my own base feelings towards a lot of things.  That I'm not worthy of what I have.  That the world, people in essence, don't deserve the beauties of the Earth.  The cruelty outweighs the kind.  The hurt outweighs the help.   We are our own destruction, and I'm just as culpable as the next.  A pessimistic nihilist, trying to cover all of that in a single coat of crayon.  I see the greatness in actions and people, but it doesn't weigh the same.  Feathers to stones.  I think I've been trying to calm this beast on my back for my whole life, doing what I could to make myself see, if I could do it, then the world isn't that bad.  Being the embodiment of your last action for someone isn't the answer.  Then what is?\n\nI'm lost.  In this ocean.  I can't find the energy to care more than just enough to not give up completely.  I left my wife, convinced that our relationship was a large part of my struggle.  I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME, TO FIGHT FOR MYSELF.  Desperation is a powerful thing.  I loved and love her immensely, but I couldn't find the part of me that felt in love with her.  I thought, if that love were there, and true, that depression couldn't mask it.   It surely couldn't obscure it from my eyes.  Maybe it can, after all.  I'm not sure what's true or not anymore.  Being her husband was very difficult, but something I could and would do if I could find that piece.  That flicker of light.  I thought me fighting my hero mentality, peeling that back, and not finding that flicker meant it wasn't there anymore.  Something's been eroding for awhile though.  My knees had already buckled and I was already crawling, just trying to find something.\n\nI had to take a leave from work in March, as I couldn't keep it together mentally.  It wasn't the first time I had used FMLA to try to sort myself out.  I had gone to a few eating disorder partial hospitalization programs, outpatient programs, a stint in an inpatient hospital, just fighting to save myself.  In this break, I found someone on Reddit to be friends with.  We became close and I, thinking I was on the right path, and had made ALL the right choices, chose to start a relationship with her.  Again, someone that needed help.  I thought it was more, and at this point, I can't tell left from right.  I pulled in someone into something that I was ill fit to handle, much less them.  I helped them get out of an abusive relationship and household, and brought them into my shit.  They've expressed their gratitude, but it doesn't make me feel decent, or anything.  All coping skills, regardless of their healthiness, have gone away.  They no longer fit.  Self awareness has collapsed their abilities, I guess.  Well, I can eat myself into a stupor, but given that that's a slow, painful, descent into more pain, struggle, and general awfulness that I've been doing better at staying away from, you can see my worry of using.  I binged yesterday, and the day before, and the day before, etc.  Transferring mental anguish to physical discomfort, if not full on pain.\n\nIt's incredibly hard to know what you're capable of, or were, and not be able to do it.  To see the work you've done, and much of it positive, but to be further and further from anything you'd want a human to feel and be.  I can be a good spouse, partner, person, but what am I doing it for?  I fought so hard to not be reliant on relationships as my compass to who and how I am.  I've watched that all my life, and saw my brother struggle with that before he passed away.  Oh yeah, he died.  Morbidly obese, severely depressed, and ultimately, alone, he died.  He was my best friend, outside my wife, and basically a twin 8 years separated (good and bad traits).  That hurt, and set me back a few years.  I can think about him now and not completely crumble though, so progress.  I can't focus, I can't think anymore.  I don't enjoy anything 98% of the time.  Overwhelmed by everything, even after taking away stressors.  0 energy, and I cry every day.  Cry at sad things.  Cry at nice things.  Cry at thoughts.  Cry at nothing.  I try to give myself breaks, but it doesn't really lift anymore.  Some of me hopes that with every test, blood work result, that they will find something wrong.  So it gives an objective answer to such an abstract struggle.  I was laid off this past week, though I knew something was going to give pretty soon.  I couldn't handle working, being a human.  I still can't most likely.  It was a soul sucking place at times.  I couldn't handle it being pretty easy, but also couldn't handle any more than almost nothing to work on either.  I now have no insurance to try to continue my search if something's wrong, applying to jobs that I struggle to see how I can handle, or if I would even want to.  I don't want to live in this system.  I don't want to work too many hours, just to eek by, and not believe that there is anything at the end.  I don't believe in people in power, the economy, our future, wars, the hopes for a better tomorrow, vanquishing evil, all of us learning from mistakes, ours and others, past, and present.  \n\nI don't think there will be a singular fix, but with everything I do to better myself, or try to, I fall further in.  I break hearts.  Am I manipulative?  I worry people.  Am I destructive?  Am I decent?  I am not what I should be.  or want to be.  I've lost what little belief in myself and now 2nd guess everything.  Indecisive.  Scared.  Confused.  I'm lost in an ocean of gray.  I want to understand why people (including myself) do what they do, but it's too convoluted.   Stuck between logic and emotion.  Trying to find the will to see and believe in the good, and be able to accept the bad, while also trying to minimize my bad.  Trying not to eat myself to death.  Trying not to fall apart any more.  Trying not to be a fucking burden. Trying to hope.  To find something that can help some, and use that to keep moving forward.  To give hope that the decisions I've made were not made in vain.  That people CAN get better.  That problems have solutions.  BUT, that thing on my back says, there's probably just people not really fit for this world.  Not that there was a better time for me to be alive, like BACK IN THE DAY, I COULD HAVE FLOURISHED.  Nah, fuck that.  I don't want people to live in pain, and I hate to think I'm in \"pain\", but I am suffering.  So I'm here.  Posting an entirely too long post, I guess glad that I've put some of it in written form.  I've been actively suicidal for a while now.  Having a plan, if I so choose, and having written letters.  I'm fighting, but I'm really not sure where to turn.  Lids of containers have come off, by my hand consciously or otherwise, and they no longer fit back on.  And their contents are fucking everywhere.  I don't have answers to any of it.  I have no compass, and maybe I never had one.  I have lost my ability to trust my own judgment.  That's one thing keeping me from killing myself.  If I don't believe I have sound judgment, then killing myself would be under similar circumstances, right?  That and the pain it would cause people close to me.  I'm not sure what I'm hoping from posting this, but, hopefully it helps someone somewhere.
