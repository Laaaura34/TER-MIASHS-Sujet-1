I always think about how the way we decided to live as an organized society has fucked us over. Every morning I wake up and I think \u201cthis again.\u201d I really really wish I was a jellyfish so I could float around and have no brain. This entire year has been utter dog shit my boyfriend my cat and my dog died and I got arrested so now I can\u2019t even get a new job to escape the shithole that is CVS. Anyways, if I was gonna kill myself I would\u2019ve already. It just sucks to live for others. I wish I had a lethal disease so I could just go to Europe and get a big fat morphine injection. I wish I could die in a way that wasn\u2019t my fault so people wouldn\u2019t be left wondering why I did it. I wish I could believe it when people say it gets better. Because it seems like even if it does get better it will just suck again eventually. And everyone around me knows how badly I want to kill myself because I talk about it so much. But I\u2019m functioning too well I guess. I do school and work and therapy. Maybe they just don\u2019t know what to say. I probably wouldn\u2019t either. I\u2019m starting ketamine therapy to try to curb these thoughts but I\u2019m worried that I put too much hope into it and if that doesn\u2019t work I\u2019ll feel utterly hopeless.
