The medication j took is a prescription medication I am prescribed that is fatal in even slight overdoses as it is usually used as an anesthetic before surgery and I did my research and more than 2g or 2000mg at once it considered the range for fatality and I took 6000mg or 6g, and then some temazepam (benzo sleep aide) and zopiclone (also sleeping med) in overdose but not that big of an overdose, I passed out and woke up like 3 hours later still alive obviously all though in pretty spacey, still very sedative but at a somewhat functional level, but have trouble with walking somewhat... anyways I\u2019m about to overdose on an OTC medication now too because I looked at the clinical studies and I have enough to cause fatality even though it\u2019s at the lower side of the spectrum for fatality rates but I\u2019m desperate, if I survive tonight, I will be getting another prescription drug that is also fatal in overdose and I\u2019ll get 700mg and 900mg is the suggested fatal amount so mixed with everything in my system, I\u2019ll likely be dead by today or tomorrow. I also plan to swallow a foreign object, likely razor blades because although they typically can pass on their own without issues due to personal experience, given the medications I\u2019ve overdosed on and the fact that they likely can cause gastric/GI bleeding and perforation, why not add to the mix and increase that chance moderately or significantly. I\u2019ve been through too much trauma in my life to go on... I have funded mental health services, I spend all my time in inpatient psych units typically, and now I have access to 2 social workers and 1 psychiatrist whom I all trust and know care but I have too much trauma I\u2019ve experienced and am too emotionally hurt and broken and it\u2019s not like I can just try to save myself and go to the hospital now because the ER staff\u2019s treatment of me is literally a major part of my recent trauma to add to it all. The things they\u2019ve said to and about it me aren\u2019t things you can just shake off especially when you can\u2019t avoid them bc for mental health and medical problems related to mental health, I am constantly in the ER or psych wards where I am also treated poorly  lot of the time although it\u2019s many the ER staff who find amusement out of the things I do to hurt myself and say things like why doesn\u2019t she actually successfully commit suicide already and it\u2019s not just one staff, it\u2019s all of them gathered around to joke and have amusement about my self harm incidents and overdoses...I was supposed to have a job interview tomorrow and though maybe just maybe I could turn my life around and especially with my further commitment to more religious life and studying religion which being me great joy, it just isn\u2019t enough... there\u2019s too much pain and suffering and trauma. Hopefully with the last enactment of my suicide plan, I will end up successful. If not I have another plan although it would involve saying up one of my medications for a full month but then it would be an I overdose that even if I made it to the ER, that kind of overdose almost certainly isn\u2019t survivable due to what medication it is and if I take enough it. I guess benefits to knowing about pharmacology,eh? I hope the people who see this make it through life and find hope, happiness, joy and resiliency even it it feels like the smallest amount... hold onto it. I\u2019m a hypocrite but I\u2019m too damaged emotionally from trauma to go on and the only people I can go to for \u201chelp\u201d even though I know it won\u2019t help is the mental health services in my area which have contributed significantly to my trauma because of the horrendous treatment I\u2019ve received there, some things that I have heard the staff say are incomprehensible. Of course I wouldn\u2019t be this way if I never experienced childhood sexual abuse and the trauma that caused in the first place. I\u2019m too groggy, exhausted and can\u2019t think straight enough anymore to explain my situation more but I\u2019ve covered all the bases. I wish you all the best, you are loved,you deserve to live in this world and find that things worth living for, I\u2019m too tired to write more of this post that is already a novel. Thank you for letting me get my most likely final words and thoughts out here before I go. Peace, love, and hope for you all.
