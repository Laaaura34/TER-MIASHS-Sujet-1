I created an alt account to make this and I have people who love and care about me, and I have never really been abused or beaten or any messed up shit like that.  \n\n\nBut I want to die  \n\n\nIts not that i'm in a bad situation, or have abusive relationships. It's just that I am bored. no matter what outcome of my life I can think about, it all leads to some lackluster life were I have nothing but melancholy interactions with those around me. What is the point of living if there is nothing to excite you anymore? The only thing that gets me excited is what happens after death. Who knows!!! There are so many possibility's that it just gets my heart racing with eagerness and enthusiasm. I could go to heaven, I could go to hell, I could pull a Konosuba and get sent to a separate world. or.. there could be nothing. It could just be.... nothing at all, just me and my thoughts. or just me.. and nothing. But! this still excites me, why would I go through the responsibility of life to have nothing where instead I could just kill myself and have the same nothing with no work! If I take that path, there is a chance were I could get what I want, excitement, or I could get what I am going to have anyway, nothing.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gvn0l7/this_might_sound_selfish/", "title": "This might sound selfish", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Zulu1467", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1591158594, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gvn0l7/this_might_sound_selfish/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427541.0189939, "replies_charged": false}
