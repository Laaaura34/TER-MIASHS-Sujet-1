Of the memories I have left from a drug hazed, anxiety and depression ridden adolescence only the hurtful, shameful remain. I don't feel like I'm worthy of coming to terms with them nor do I know how when it seems so impossible. Even my image in the mirror is shameful, thoughts aside. I've seen a shrink for 3 years, downed his fucking useless meds, and he can talk all day about blocking these thoughts and convincing myself they're wrong but at the end of the day (or the beginning) everything I have left screams at me that I'm worthless, and with no hope left and such strong arguments, I believe. Anxiety makes friends, jobs, college all hell, same kinda hell with depression and everything else. What's left but to end it. I want everything to stop. Just fucking stop. \n\nI'm not sure about what to do, what kinda advice to ask for, or even what I expect from this really...but thanks for bearing with me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2i7dii/anxiously_drowning_in_a_clearcut_crystal_sea_of/", "title": "Anxiously drowning in a clear-cut, crystal sea of regret and despair.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MagicalMinotaur", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1412356869, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2i7dii/anxiously_drowning_in_a_clearcut_crystal_sea_of/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426227.434462, "replies_charged": false}
