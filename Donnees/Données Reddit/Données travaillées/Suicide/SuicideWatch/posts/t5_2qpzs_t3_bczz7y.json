My feelings are worse and my thoughts are getting darker. Recently I met this girl (FYI I\u2019m in high school) and we have so much in common, to my knowledge not depression, hopefully bc this sucks. She tells me I\u2019m really quiet and chill all the time, which is true but she\u2019s a party girl and to her (I\u2019m assuming) I\u2019m boring. I don\u2019t know if I want to live and try to see if things work with her or if I want to die, normally I wouldn\u2019t want to develop feelings for anybody but she\u2019s different, my heart skips a beat when I see her, and for me that\u2019s more positive emotion than I\u2019m used to. Basically I don\u2019t want to die if I knew things would work out, but I wouldn\u2019t want to stick around for things not to work out. The biggest problem is even if I decide she\u2019s worth living for, idk how I would talk to her about my depression, or if I shouldn\u2019t say anything and remain closed off.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bczz7y/indecision/", "title": "Indecision", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GarIsLonely", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1555222683, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bczz7y/indecision/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426610.5820613, "replies_charged": false}
