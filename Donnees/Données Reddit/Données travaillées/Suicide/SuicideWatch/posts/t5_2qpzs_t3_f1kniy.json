We where young when we first met, It was on a cruise ship when I was around 14 to be precise, funnily enough I had little interest in girls back then and just tried my hardest to find internet to speak to all of my internet friends from across the world, about 5 years went by occasionally messaging her as acquaintances do, a casual check up every now and then, the typical \"Hey! How are things\" kind of conversations you have with everyone, but for some reason I felt straight away that she was supposed to be apart of my life.\n\nWe ended up matching on tinder years later, I used to super like every one i knew, (at least that is what i told her because it was embarrassing to say i super liked you because you're fucking gorgeous) and my super like turned into an immediate match with her, we started speaking a bit, the typical boring small talk, and moved on to a different social media to continue our conversation, from that point onward until about a month ago, we spoke every single day, eventually fell in love, got together and tried our hardest to make it all work. A month or two ago, after a nice year and a half long relationship, she dropped the bomb of \"wanting a break\" on me, which eventually after a perilous 2 weeks, became a breakup, we tried a few times after that, she would tell me she wanted me back, come back from a week long trip or come back from some kind of psychedelic drug use and tell me that she had realised she wants to be single, she assured me the breakup wasn't my fault, and I didn't do anything wrong, she just needs to find herself and be alone.\n\nI don't really know why I'm writing all of this, the end message is that I am not handling the breakup as well as I thought I would, I wake up every single day with a pain I've never really felt before, and I've lost plenty of friends/family in my life, I spent years depressed prior to this, but this feels different entirely. It's almost like my entire body wants me to kill myself, I spend all day every day in physical pain due to this intense sadness, I just daydream and suffer, drag myself out of bed every morning even though waking up = day ruined, I have no one left to speak to about these things, I don't do well with psychologists and shit, my best friend became a Christian and dipped on our friendship because our entire dynamic was driving, smoking ciggies and talking shit, and he doesn't want to be apart of a life that doesn't serve god now, that beautiful girl that made me feel strong left, I'm to ashamed of how i feel to confide in my parents, and no one else really seems to understand or care. Everyone just says \"it takes time\" but I'm struggling to see how a few months could possibly change how i feel, it's like being deflated, i feel hollow and empty inside, some days I just feel like a robot, but a broken robot, one that fails every task it sets out to achieve, I hold no ill will toward her, I still love her with all my heart and I know that she'll live a blessed and happy life, I know my parents would suffer If I chose to die, my friends probably would too, I know all of the consequences of the action, but I feel it getting closer every single day, I don't have the spine to throw myself off of a bridge, I don't want to overdose because I had drug addictions when I was younger and people would just think of me as some useless junkie, I really don't know what to do.\n\nAll I know is, my brain is a complete mess, I have absolutely no will to go on, to continue suffering onward and feeling this torturous pain every single minute of my life, some people say it takes a few months, some people say it takes years, but I am not prepared to feel this way for another minute.\n\nIf anyone has felt this deflating emptiness, If anyone reads what saudade means and truly understands it, please give me some hope, monologues wont work on me, \"lights at the end of tunnels\" will give me nothing, \"people will miss you\" and all of the other typical cliches people love to say to people that are broken because they have an attraction to the challenge of fixing what is broken  won't help me, I need genuine hope, I need some kind of new perspective or way of thinking that I can employ to save my own life, because at this rate, I'm not going to make it another month.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f1kniy/i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "title": "i dont know what to do.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BudgetTrain8", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1581306865, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f1kniy/i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427547.1290326, "replies_charged": false}
