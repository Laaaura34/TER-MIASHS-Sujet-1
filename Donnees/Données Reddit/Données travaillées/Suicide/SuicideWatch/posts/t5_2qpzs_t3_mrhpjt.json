I loved him, but I didn't see us together forever, and I let my fear of the breakup being worse the longer our relationship lasted push me into ending it. I thought the timing would help, and we would have 2020 to heal. \n\nAnd then shit happened. And I spent my entire year living alone in the apartment we had shared, feeling guilty and hating myself for choosing to go through it alone. And moreso for making him go through it alone.\n\nI think about killing myself all the time. I think that ending my life is the only way to let him and everyone know how badly I feel. I'm a positive person, and I never show people how broken inside I feel everyday, except when it's taken as a joke. \n\nI just feel lost and sad. On paper everything is going well. But inside I am unable to escape the guilt and the sorrow and the feeling that I've ruined my own life and shouldn't have ended the relationship. I keep telling myself that all I can do now is live with that guilt and accept it and move on. But I don't want to live with it. I don't think I can.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mrhpjt/living_or_not_with_the_guilt/", "title": "Living (or not) with the Guilt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "guiltyfailure1", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618502413, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mrhpjt/living_or_not_with_the_guilt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426200.0276694, "replies_charged": false}
