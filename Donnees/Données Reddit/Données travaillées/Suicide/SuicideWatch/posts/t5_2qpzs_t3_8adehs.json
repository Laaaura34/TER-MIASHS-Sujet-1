I think I\u2019m anorexic, I feel fat, even though people keep telling me I\u2019m getting way too thin, my parents beg me to eat but I don\u2019t want to, my depression is way more powerful than my hunger. whenever anyone sees me almost naked they tell me they see the bones of my pelvis and they see my rib cage, I only have 4 spoonfuls of food everyday for the past days because I don\u2019t want anything, I just want the person who broke my heart to come back to me, I just want to speak to my friend (whom I lost to suicide in feb). My parents try to take me out, I try to focus on my hobbies and my academics but I just don\u2019t want to, people keep telling me that will get stronger, if anything I just keep getting weaker and weaker, and recently I just keep screaming my love\u2019s name in my sleep. It pains me how much he hates me now (more info on my circumstances in my previous posts) . I keep a chart counting up how long I have been suffering, and you would be surprised when you see it.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8adehs/anorexic_depressed_heartbroken_in_mourning/", "title": "Anorexic, depressed, heartbroken , in mourning, desolate.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Omalk", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1523051280, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8adehs/anorexic_depressed_heartbroken_in_mourning/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426798.1639442, "replies_charged": false}
