Good extended family connections. Basically one of those straight A type students that got everything we\u2019re supposed to want in life. \n\nBut I\u2019ve battled depression for 15+ years. It led to a divorce about 12 years ago. After the divorce my ex accused me of inappropriately touching our daughter and had my custody and visitation taken away and I\u2019ve been dealing with the system ever since to regain visitation. \n\nIn the years after that I hit my lowest point and made two half hearted suicide attempts. In my fucked up headspace I also rationalized to myself that if everyone thought I was some sexual predator that I should peek into Pandora\u2019s box and I searched for illegal teen porn. \n\nIn the preceding years after I felt like my depression had eased but having broken that taboo once I continued to occasionally view things I knew I shouldn\u2019t. I justified it to myself that they were girls showing off, wanting to be seen, and I wasn\u2019t taking photos or paying for it. And yeah the taboo of it no doubt enhanced the sexual effects. \n\nSo there is no doubt of my guilt and I expect to be judged for it. But recently my gmail account was disabled for violating terms of service, I assume because of a Google drive folder I kept that had mostly adult nudes but also a few teens I\u2019d stupidly viewed and saved. \n\nSo now I\u2019m living most all of everyday in fear and anticipation of the state police showing up at my work or home to arrest me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the kind of person that can mentally handle prison or the lifetime of social stigma, losing my professional license, losing my kids, and facing the shame that\u2019s to come from my family and community. \n\nI feel like my best option is to preemptively take my life before I\u2019m charged so my family can get a life insurance payout and maybe be spared the truth about me. \n\nWe have a scheduled Disney vacation in a month and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the risk to wait that long. I don\u2019t even really know why I\u2019m posting this. It feels just like it will just used against me somehow. But I guess I\u2019m looking for any flaw in my logic or reason to be hopeful that I\u2019m not completely screwed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ma7l5a/considering_suicide_before_arrest/", "title": "Considering suicide before arrest", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway830402", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616364885, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ma7l5a/considering_suicide_before_arrest/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428437.76101, "replies_charged": false}
