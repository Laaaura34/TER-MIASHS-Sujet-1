I've never done drugs in my life but that's what everyone assumes if they notice. just being outside of my house for too long is enough for me to wretch and gag and throw up everywhere, some days i have to sit in my chair like a statue because im going to vomit if i move too much. forget about finding a doctor, all the waitlists are backed up and insurance is worth shit. \n\nim so fucking sick of the side effects from med after med after med. I hate tremors, headaches, no appetite, too MUCH appetite, lethargy, sudden energy, insomnia. I hate it all.\nim not in crisis. i know i wont go through with it anyway. I cant even cry anymore, my current meds just dull all my emotions.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwidud/no_employable_skills_no_drive_if_i_have_to_work/", "title": "no employable skills, no drive, if i have to work retail again suicide is inevitable", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Rawrn542", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632753299, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwidud/no_employable_skills_no_drive_if_i_have_to_work/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426550.5104837, "replies_charged": false}
