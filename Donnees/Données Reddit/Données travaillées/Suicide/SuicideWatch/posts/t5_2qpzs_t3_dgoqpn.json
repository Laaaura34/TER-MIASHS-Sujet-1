I believe I have alienated my Kung Fu Family by not getting better and being able to apply their life advice.\n\nTonight I lost my composure and I believe I have alienated the last group of people who love me despite my scars. I (25, f) am disgustingly fat; obese class. I am 329 lbs. But I am active. I suffered from bulimia, binge eating and self harm in the past. I have been working towards recovery and feeling better with therapy and getting serious with my martial arts practice. Medication did not help, so I stopped and have been medication free for a few months.\n\nI look to be in recovery. I look okay. I act okay. But I am screaming. I am fighting Disordered Eating again. I hate myself; my body is loathsome. I had a meltdown last night because I have only lost 5 lbs, despite working out often every week. The issue is binging/restriction. I feel as if I am wasting the time of my trainer, who is my Older Kung Fu Brother. I feel I am letting down my Kung Fu Family because I cannot lose any weight. \n\nI had a meltdown during training, feeling frustrated with my lack of visible progress. After a tense talk with my older brother and an arguement my boyfriend over the situation, I left. Now I'm sitting on the edge of the local river (major waterway) and wondering if I should just give myself to the water.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dgoqpn/sitting_on_the_river_bank_tw_ed/", "title": "Sitting on the River Bank (tw: ED)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Cam_Leon", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1570845171, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dgoqpn/sitting_on_the_river_bank_tw_ed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422953.996208, "replies_charged": false}
