And some days my joints hearts.\nI dropped out from uni.\nI have literally 0 friends (let alone ever had a girlfriend). When I walk down the street people that I know seems gross out by my appearance,even tough I wear nice clothes. My only \"friend\" hangs out with me for pity and my money, hence I cut with her.\nMy higiene is deteriorating but now I am focusing a lot on it. Also this year I self harmed my self for 3 times. And this is objectively on the outside, on the inside my head is truly fucked up. I am thinking constantly on why I am such a failure and also how I can killl my self. The problem is that I am not able to stop having these thoughts. I have  a rope under my bed one day I might use it or use a poison near my desk.\n\nSorry for my English I am an Italian native speaker.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qegc23/do_i_have_depression/", "title": "Do I have depression", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Snoo91780", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635032472, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qegc23/do_i_have_depression/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422883.5728915, "replies_charged": false}
