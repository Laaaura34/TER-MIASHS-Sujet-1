I guess I've been suicidal for a while now, but its getting to the point where I'm not sure I'm in control anymore.  Half of me thinks this is the right thing to do, and the other half is terrified of doing it.  The reason I mention I live in Virginia is because I am an avid target shooter, and am afraid that admitting I am suicidal may inhibit me owning a firearm in the future.  If I could get a general idea of what to expect that would really help me I think.
