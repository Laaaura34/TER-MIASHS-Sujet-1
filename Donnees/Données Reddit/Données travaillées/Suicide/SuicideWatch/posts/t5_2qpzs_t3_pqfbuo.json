Honestly, I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m even doing. I just...don\u2019t know what to do with myself at this point, and I don\u2019t think I even want to make an effort to get help anymore. I\u2019m depressed out of my goddamn mind, I fantasize killing myself several times a day and I\u2019m convinced I\u2019ll never stop being like this...but I don\u2019t even have a good reason to.\n\nSome background; I\u2019m a 21 y/o male, still living at home. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was young and went through several medications without finding any significant improvement. I zone out without realizing it and have pathetic memorization skills. I graduated high school three years ago, got rejected from University three times before finally making it into a Social Work program, and now that I am here I\u2019m already doing badly at quizzes and assignments. I used to be religious, but now...I don\u2019t even know what I believe, really. I\u2019ve had multiple therapists over the years, and each of them only seemed to provide temporary relief. I\u2019ve struggled with suicidal thoughts since junior high, and a decade later my thoughts are still as tempting as ever.\n\nI\u2019ve always been horrible at school; I went throughout both Junior High and High School without ever making the honor roll once, and it took my heart and soul to get marks in the C range. I forget the simplest tasks and miss details on exams and projects that normal people are able to do like second nature. During middle school I was bullied frequently for being a weirdo, and even when I entered high school I was unpopular as hell. I didn\u2019t get a part time job during my school years because I couldn\u2019t study efficiently even with the amount of time I had. Last year I only got through the Entrance Option class due to it being online and having notes to help me. I have two genius siblings (one about to graduate engineering and another on her way to med school) and here I am barely even able to get a half decent mark. With the grades I\u2019m getting, I\u2019ll never be able to land a good job, have a respectable career, find someone interested in me and settle down being able to provide. God knows I\u2019ve tried to improve, but at the rate it\u2019s going it\u2019s just a wistful dream.\n\nEven outside of school I\u2019m an incompetent moron. I have no special talents at anything. Sports, music, cooking, writing, etc. Nothing. During my gap years, I\u2019ve gotten fired at 3 out of the 4 jobs I worked at (albeit I got rehired at one, but still) and I continued to make stupid mistakes despite working at the same places for months on end. I\u2019m awful at answering messages, I\u2019m by far the stupidest person in my friend group (as well as the least accomplished), and I\u2019m positive the only reason my friends hang out with me is because they pity how pathetic I am and are too nice to reject invitations to meet up. I\u2019ve only been in one serious relationship with a girl for like half a year (which fell apart due to me being an unreliable dumbass), and I have literally nothing going for me that could be considered attractive. I don\u2019t have any meaningful hobbies and I waste time reading comics and watching videos to distract myself from reality. In layman's terms, I\u2019m a loser.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve had esteem issues for longer than I can remember, I only finally attempted suicide back in my senior year of high school, with my brother intervening and stopping me, leading to me getting thrown into a psychiatric hospital for an extensive period of time. When people ask me why I did it, I usually just tell them that I was simply in a bad mental state and let emotions cloud my judgement, stuff to just end the conversation. In reality, I did it because frankly...it just made sense. I wasn\u2019t going anywhere. I didn\u2019t have high enough grades to get into post-secondary. I had no great talents to land a job in the arts. Really, what did I have to offer the world? Who would hire a loser like that? Who would ever consider dating someone who couldn\u2019t get his life together? The world losing someone that insignificant, would it matter at all?\n\n*\u201cBut your friends will miss you!\u201d* Honestly...I can sort of believe that. But while I can imagine there would be a few people who\u2019d be upset at my passing, I can\u2019t think of a single person whose life would actually significantly alter without me. I\u2019ve accomplished nothing. I\u2019ve left not a single impact on any life I\u2019ve encountered. I have an okay amount of friends, but I\u2019m nobody\u2019s \u201cbest friend.\u201d I\u2019m as expendable as they come, and I don\u2019t have anyone who\u2019s better off for having known me. Hell, my parents would have one less manchild at home to look after with more time for my siblings, and my friends would almost certainly realize how much better off they are without me in time.\n\nI\u2019m sure this post will probably piss off a lot of people. I know these really aren\u2019t good reasons to hate myself, much less consider suicide. I\u2019m able-bodied, technically still young, and despite my mental drawbacks I can still somewhat function. I didn\u2019t always get along with my parents, but they never horribly abused me or were addicted to substances or something. I got bullied quite a bit, but I wasn\u2019t explicitly pressured to kill myself or anything. And while I don\u2019t come from an extremely rich background, we\u2019ve never had the looming threat of poverty over us. I imagine a number of you are rolling your eyes like \u201cThat\u2019s it? *Those* are your problems? Get over it.\u201d  I know a lot of people have it so much worse, and I have so little to complain about in comparison\u2026.and that\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t have an excuse for being an absolute failure and getting dejected the way I do. The problem is just who I am as a person, and there\u2019s no cure for that. I\u2019m a coward, a weakling, and a quitter who doesn\u2019t deserve to be happy, much less waste the world\u2019s oxygen supply.\n\nI joined the program I\u2019m in (Social Work Diploma) because I thought even if I myself am a worthless person, if I could at least devote my life to a greater cause and help others, then maybe I could have at least some sort of merit as a human being. But it looks like I won\u2019t even be able to do that because I need a minimum grade to go forward, which I don\u2019t even know if I can achieve. At this point, I don\u2019t know what to do with myself anymore. Once again, suicide doesn\u2019t just look like a solution or a \u201cway out.\u201d It genuinely feels like a logical idea to me, and if tomorrow was my last day alive, I\u2019d probably die the same way I lived.
