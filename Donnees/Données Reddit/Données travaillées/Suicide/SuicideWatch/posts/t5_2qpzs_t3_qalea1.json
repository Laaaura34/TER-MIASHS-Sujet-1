Nothing I do or ever will do matters, so why bother at all? There isn\u2019t a point to any of this. Happiness is a total lie, the whole thought of \u201cbeing happy\u201d is stupid and fake. I\u2019m in constant mental pain just because my brain decided, \u201c hey I\u2019m tired of doing this I\u2019m just going to make you want to stay in bed, not do anything, and kill yourself\u201d and now I have to suffer. I\u2019m always sad unless distracted, I\u2019m a horrible terrible person on the inside, I don\u2019t like the way I look/sound/anything and I\u2019m truly bored. Nothing does it anymore. Nothing makes me laugh like it used to, nothing makes me feel the same way anymore. I can\u2019t wait to die, just the thought of slipping into icy cold numbness fills me with pure joy.And honestly\u2026 it\u2019s a relief that I\u2019m going to die one day. The scariest thing is that I say I want to change but I do nothing to change I\u2019m so fucking lazy.
