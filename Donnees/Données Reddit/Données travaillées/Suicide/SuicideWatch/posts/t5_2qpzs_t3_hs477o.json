I feel shitty for having no reason to feel shitty.  I always wonder when the people in my life are gonna realize that I am shitty, but anything shitty that has happened to me has been a result of my own choices.\n\nWhen things get bad in my head I do shitty things on purpose to push people away or make them hate me.  I don\u2019t want to hurt the people close to me but I feel like it\u2019s inevitable that I\u2019m going to end up killing myself someday and I\u2019d rather people just say \u2018good riddance\u2019.\n\nMy dad killed himself, my uncle did, my grandpa did.  Idk about before that but I\u2019m sure it goes back further.  I think about it every day.  I don\u2019t let myself make new friends.  I sabotage relationships with old friends.  I never talk to any of my family.\n\nI don\u2019t like feeling like this and I know I need help, but it doesn\u2019t seem worth it.  I don\u2019t think I want to kill myself, I just don\u2019t want to live.  I don\u2019t feel worth it and I don\u2019t see a point in a life where I have to force myself just to exist.  It\u2019s exhausting and I dread it.  I bought a gun just to always have the option.  I just don\u2019t want anyone to miss me and it feels like I\u2019m getting closer and closer to achieving that goal.\n\nI\u2019m not on the verge of killing myself right this second.  I did put the gun to my head earlier tonight, but it wasn\u2019t the first time and it won\u2019t be the last.  Each time I can pull the trigger a little more.  And again, the thing that set me off was a result of my own doing.\n\nIdk what I\u2019m trying to accomplish posting this tbh.  I never tell people this.  I\u2019m not looking for consolation or commiseration.  It\u2019s prolly just cuz at the end of the day, if I do end up pulling the trigger, none of you would know or care anywayz.\n\nSorry if you ended up reading all of that.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hs477o/dont_reply/", "title": "Don\u2019t reply.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "yepimbonez", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594878695, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hs477o/dont_reply/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425159.8289723, "replies_charged": false}
