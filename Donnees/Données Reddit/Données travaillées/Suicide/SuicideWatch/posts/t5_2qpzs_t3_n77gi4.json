Halfway through I started going in and out of consciousness, and it was painful. My mouth was dry, so dry that I could barely talk. I couldn't walk straight as my vision was bouncy as well. Called the cops, decided I wanted to live, ambulance comes over, they measure my heart rate. Resting at 140/50 bpm. Hook me up to an IV drip for 24 hours as all of my magnesium and other supplements in my body were used up literally saving my life. Passed out.\n\n4/19/21. Wake up in the hospital (Pullman Regional) Tell cops why I wanted to kill myself. Go to St Josephs Medical Center in Lewiston, Idaho. Stay there until 4/25/21 with other suicidal patients and a schizophrenic who thinks his name is ta and is god.\n\n0/10. Won't attempt suicide again unless it is physician assisted suicide.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n77gi4/1st_suicide_attempt_psych_ward_stay_storytime/", "title": "1st suicide attempt + psych ward stay storytime", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AcidicOdin123", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 68, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620417553, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n77gi4/1st_suicide_attempt_psych_ward_stay_storytime/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428562.124315, "replies_charged": false}
