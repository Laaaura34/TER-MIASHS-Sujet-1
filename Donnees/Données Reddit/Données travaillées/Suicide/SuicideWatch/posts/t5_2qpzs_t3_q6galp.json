I\u2019ve been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was cognizant (5-6.) I\u2019ve been semi-transparent with my family (partially out of necessity,) since I was 15. I previously had anorexia, and I\u2019ve always had anxiety and depression. I\u2019ve had suicidal ideation for the past 3 years, starting when I opened my small business. Recently, I\u2019ve had to move back in with my parents. They\u2019ve questioned my depressive habits (spending all day in bed,) my anxiety/panic attacks, my drinking issues, and my eating habits (under/over-eating.) \n\nSorry for the rambling, I\u2019m just hoping someone can give me some hope at this moment. \n\nI cannot tell them about my suicidal ideation\u2014I\u2019ve mentioned it in the past, and they\u2019ve either ignored it or threatened to tell me psychiatrist. I know I should tell my medical staff, but I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll put me in a hospital. \n\nAny, and I mean any, kind of advice would be more than welcomed. I feel like I have no one to talk to.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q6galp/i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "title": "I don\u2019t know what to do", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Relevant_Butterfly", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634021870, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q6galp/i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422252.681012, "replies_charged": false}
