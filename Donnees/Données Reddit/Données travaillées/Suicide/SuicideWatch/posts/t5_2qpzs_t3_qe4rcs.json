It is quite a scary feeling because usually I would try to find ways to not feel depressed and anxious by doing meditation or something but now the idea of suicide doesn't seem so bad. I self harm and I do think it helps get rid of the suicidal thoughts temporarily but it's not really a good way to cope with any of this. I think the scary thing is how casual the thoughts are. I will be doing something and I will imagine hanging myself and it just feels so normal because it seems like a viable option to end the pain and suffering.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qe4rcs/suicidal_thoughts_creeping_up/", "title": "Suicidal thoughts creeping up", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "toad890", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634994997, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qe4rcs/suicidal_thoughts_creeping_up/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427350.325137, "replies_charged": false}
