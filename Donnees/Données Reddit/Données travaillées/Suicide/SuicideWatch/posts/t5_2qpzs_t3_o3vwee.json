That I don't try to even keep up with things... I try but it seems that every time I do it just surmounts to another problem. And that problem is connected to this problem. And at this point, I just want to fucking die... I wish someone would just fucking stab or shoot me. Or even fucking running me over with a car... I'm tired these past 4 years Ive been trying to fight and survive. But it seems like the people i care for do not even care. Everyday my options get lesser and lesser and in which I have to sacrifice something for something else. Time for this or time for that... Everyday its just a frustrating cycle. And Ive been just distracting myself to mitigate or try to alleviate any of these ideas. Fuck now Im planning to join the army, maybe there at least if i die it would've been for something. I hate myself, i fucking hate myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o3vwee/everyday_it_just_feels_that_everything_is_just/", "title": "Everyday it just feels that everything is just going to shit...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "IrvinSalt", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624157339, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o3vwee/everyday_it_just_feels_that_everything_is_just/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428226.2383218, "replies_charged": false}
