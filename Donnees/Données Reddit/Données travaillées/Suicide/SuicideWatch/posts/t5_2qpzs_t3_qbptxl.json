We are taught them at women are more valuable than mus. As a dude, barely have many guy friends. This is because guys are very emotionally unavailable. Guys also are always told to man up. Like when I confronted my dad on his abuse all I was told was to \u201cman up\u201d. (Aswell as screaming, of course.) Anytime you face any sort of challenge your life all you are told is to \u201cman up\u201d. I\u2019ve told other men about my depression and all ive been told was to \u201cman up\u201d. Including by women. Why does this term even still exist? First of all I wasn\u2019t even a \u201cman\u201d then, I was like 13+. Second of all we live in an advanced society where we shouldn\u2019t even have to wory about \u201cManning up\u201d because we aren\u2019t even Hunter gatherers anymore. I wish I was just treated like others man. I also hate being black with depression because most minority parents shun upon even the discussion of mental issues and most probably think it doesn\u2019t even exist.
