Eating disorders, suicidal thoughts and self harm.\n\nSo, well, alright. How do I talk about this. Warning that this might get political I guess? I\u2019ll try to avoid the root of it, but political dissonance in the household is one of the causes of conflict here that\u2019s getting to me. I would like to be clear: the entire point of the argument is that I DON\u2019T want to talk about it. \n\nIf you read my post history then, yeah, I broke up with my boyfriend recently. Sure, it\u2019s a stressor, but not really as much of one as I would\u2019ve thought. I feel a bit better with distance on that one, you can read the post for context. It\u2019s been a week since I broke it off with him and he did previously happen to be the only person I really talked to, so while that may have some bearing on my current state, I do believe I am better off without him. \n\nAlright. Onto the real stuff. The more immediate stuff I guess. Over the course of this past week my anxiety\u2019s gotten worse. I\u2019ve started having all my classic \u201ctells\u201d that I\u2019m stressed\u2014muscle aches not explained my exercise, being unable to sleep at all (I\u2019ve gotten a total of 3.4 hours of sleep in total according to my Fitbit for the past 7 days), eating disturbances (bulimia\u2019s gotten worse, I\u2019ve really been binging horribly and throwing it up but burns so much worse than it used to). so things are bad. Today I\u2019m tired but sitting in a pitch black room after taking Benadryl and putting earplugs in for an hour didnt do anything to help me sleep. I\u2019m still awake. I don\u2019t consume products with significant forms of caffeine, so that\u2019s not the problem. I\u2019ve been taking my meds. Not really sure what the issue is. Anyway my head feels like it\u2019s full of cotton balls and I can\u2019t think. I\u2019m starting to stutter again, which sucks. My parents make fun of me for that. Always makes it worse. \n\nSo today my father asked me if I wanted to go to a convention later in the year, I said I didn\u2019t really feel safe doing that. This devolved into a conversation, then further into an argument that basically sums up to: \n\nMy side: I\u2019m too tired to debate. I can barely do work and I\u2019m obviously stressed and I\u2019m trying to make it through the day. I do not want to talk about this. Please do not make me talk. Please let me eat my lunch so that I don\u2019t starve myself and eat even more later. I have therapy tomorrow. Just let me get through this. I know we disagree on this issue and I know you will not believe anything I say and will argue that the burden of proof is on me, which I do not feel like I have enough energy to carry. I just don\u2019t want to fight. Please don\u2019t make me talk. Please stop laughing at my stutter. Please just stop. \n\nVersus \n\nMy dad, who thinks that I: -am lazy, stupid, and that the reason why I\u2019m not talking is because I know my argument is indefensible. The fact that I refuse to engage the conversation means that I\u2019m not even willing to talk to him, which is unreasonable and shows really how far this country has fallen because you\u2019re not even willing to stand up for your beliefs and you\u2019re extremely isolated just because you know any other viewpoint would absolutely obliterate your fragile viewpoint and ego. You\u2019re ungrateful. You\u2019re mean. This is abusive to refuse to talk to me. This is because you\u2019re hormonal. Being tired is an excuse because we all know you do that intentionally so you can play the victim. Stop shaking, stop stuttering, we know you do that for attention, stop. \n\n\nAs you can see it\u2019s a very productive conversation that ended with him less than a centimeter from my face telling me that if I loved masks so much that I should go... \u201csuck Fauci\u2019s dick.\u201d They have a habit of calling me a whore. I\u2019m not even physical in my romantic relationships but it\u2019s still hurtful even if I know it isn\u2019t true. \n\nAnyway my heart was racing and my chest hurt and I felt shaky so I grabbed a mask from our mask Laundry bag on the door and ran outside \u201cfor a walk\u201d in my pajamas and without my car keys. It\u2019s freezing here. I tried to stay outside for as long as I could but I can\u2019t exactly do much. Eventually I was forced to return because they got the neighborhood to corral me back to the house. The only thing I could\u2019ve said to stop them was that I need help and that I don\u2019t feel safe. I would lose everything if I said that. So that\u2019s not happening. Haha. \n\nSo now I\u2019m locked in a bathroom upstairs with people yelling into the door. I don\u2019t really feel like there\u2019s a way out of this situation\u2014not just being locked in a bathroom but in general. My bank accounts aren\u2019t in my name and I cannot pull the money from them. If I leave here, if I do anything, I lose all forms of insurance, money, belongings, everything except my car, which is the only thing in my name (except the insurance). I don\u2019t know. Even then, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s bad enough to even report. they\u2019re not physical or anything. It\u2019s my own goddamn fault and I know If I complain to anyone about it the answer\u2019s always going to be \u201cmove out\u201d and \u201chow much of an idiot are you, just leave, when I was your age I paid off college and paid rent and got my own insurance and phone plan and everything else by pulling myself up by my bootstraps, that\u2019s how parents are.\u201d But I don\u2019t HAVE a way out. The monetary cushion id have would disappear the minute I tried. All my paychecks got deposited in an account I don\u2019t even own. I have nothing to my name. I have no way out. I don\u2019t have friends, really, except for one that reconnected with me but it\u2019s mostly an acquaintanceship. I dumped my boyfriend. At this point I\u2019m kind of thinking my best course of action is to die. I won\u2019t have to go through this anymore. I won\u2019t have to try to ask for help and listen to the talk about how this is my fault anymore. It\u2019s less expensive for everyone anyway as long as they don\u2019t have some sort of fancy funeral for appearances. They\u2019d have more money to help my brother move out and get married and give them the grand babies they want. They\u2019d have more money to retire. Everyone would be happier. They\u2019d fight less.\n\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really see a point in trying to walk outside anymore. I don\u2019t know a way to move out. I\u2019m a negative influence on everyone. I keep thinking about doing something specific but I don\u2019t want to describe it because the rules say no describing plans I guess. But I am thinking about it. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I think my therapist would say I am silly, I am just in pain and making a catastrophe out of a little thing, that I am being dramatic. Maybe that\u2019s what I need to hear. I really don\u2019t want to but maybe it is. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really feel happy about much anymore, so if I make others so frustrated and even I\u2019m not enjoying life, then I am really not sure how to justify staying.
