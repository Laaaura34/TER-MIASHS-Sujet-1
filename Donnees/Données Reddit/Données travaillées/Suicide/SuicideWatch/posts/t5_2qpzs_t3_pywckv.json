I am tired of this life, I just can't, call me pathetic but its just how I feel I am sorry.\n\nIt just has to be this way, there is no hope with my mind working against me like this, I will end up a loser failure if I continue and I just don't want to disappoint,  I pray that I just leave this world swift and fast, but if im being honest ive been praying for that every night, it just never comes. \n\nLiving is high risk while dying is just so much better, I will be a fool if I live, I would rather die then fight anymore, I hate being this loser, unwanted shell of a person, no one took my cries seriously, this is seriously my only option, I wish people just saw me the same as everyone else, I wish I couldve been normal instead of a loser. \n\nLife has just begun but it feels like its already over, anything can happen sure but that also includes negative things, and I just can't take anymore negative anymore, its been negative my whole life, I can't see myself getting any older, I will take my own life before I see anymore terrible days. Hopefully I can rest in peace, no more then one attempt, nothing would be better then that. \n\nSorry, I am not living to be this unwanted loser, I am not living to live, I can't see why people would want me alive because I don't wanna be alive, I am not living with this low of self esteem, I am not living anymore, death is the option, and I have taken it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pywckv/teenage_suicide/", "title": "Teenage Suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Lost-Water8995", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633047276, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pywckv/teenage_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427951.398961, "replies_charged": false}
