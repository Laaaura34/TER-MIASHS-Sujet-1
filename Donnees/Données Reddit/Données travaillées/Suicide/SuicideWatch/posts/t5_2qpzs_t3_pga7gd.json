Figured I\u2019d just snort a gram and get it over and done with.\n\nI\u2019m pretty young 18-20 but the pains too much and maybe there\u2019s a good side if I keep fighting but it\u2019s been so long and still have so far to go I know I couldn\u2019t handle it. Worst part is my birthdays coming up in the next 10 days or so and that\u2019s probably when I\u2019ll do it because I\u2019ll be alone with the house, I\u2019m a fucking cunt and I hate it so much what I\u2019m doing to my family it\u2019s selfish of me and I wish people could see it as me finally not being in pain but I know they won\u2019t see it that way.\n\nFeel stupid for even writing this but I guess it\u2019s more so my suicide letter than anything I think if someone is home at the time I will have to go to the park because I\u2019m not having one of my family walk in my room and find me dead I also would like to call an ambulance before hand so only they have to deal with it but I don\u2019t think I can since they will most likely wake me up before you know\n\nDon\u2019t have guns where I am which I find funny because I probably would of been dead long ago if we did, tried a knife a couple times but could never bring myself to do it just sat down holding it to me for a while crying. Tried heroin before didn\u2019t do shit but got higher quality and I think when I did that I only took half a gram this is all in the past 2-3 years.\n\nI hate thinking about what my family\u2019s reaction would be so I try not to but writing it out obviously doesn\u2019t help all I know is I\u2019m a cunt for doing it to them regardless of the past.  \n\nI will say part of my issue is the health care system. I\u2019ve tried so many times to get therapy/psychologist but it\u2019s such a long process and than I finally get one again and they start ignore my emails and not calling so I just gave up. I\u2019ve got undiagnosed mental illness\u2019s but because I\u2019m 18+ I need to pay just to see if I have it like around 200-450$ just for 1 diagnosis. My gp is useless giving me melatonin when I keep saying I can\u2019t sleep it\u2019s not helping and my sleep cycles all over the place than there\u2019s anxiety I barely leave the house I don\u2019t even go to my gp I call them because I can\u2019t go into it but everytime \u201chere take these anti depressants\u201d sure doc start taking for a few months call the gp because it\u2019s not helping \u201coh just stick with it we will see how you go\u201d keeps using no improvement ends up going off than starting a new anti depressant same shit than a new one. \n\nFuck I\u2019ve walked into hospital a few times over being suicidal including the time I took half a gram of heroin they just made me sit down for hours waiting I ended up just leaving another time go in their hopefully I\u2019ll get help stay for 6-7 hours get a bed than get told yeah they will take me but it\u2019s not going to get me any medical help so I had to pretend that I was all fine just so I could leave. It\u2019s like no one cares because I\u2019m not bursting out crying. I guess I can\u2019t blame them though I\u2019m a high school drop out because I couldn\u2019t focus and have never had a job so don\u2019t get why I should expect them to care.\n\nSo yeah I\u2019m sorry to my family when this happens not that means anything compared to what I\u2019m doing to them. I wish so many things could of gone different but life doesn\u2019t usually have a happy ending I guess.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pga7gd/tired_of_all_the_pain_plan_on_killing_myself_and/", "title": "Tired of all the pain, plan on killing myself and I hate the guilt that comes with it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Throwaway44422234", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630555162, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pga7gd/tired_of_all_the_pain_plan_on_killing_myself_and/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426179.2058756, "replies_charged": false}
