The already unreliable nature of most suicide methods isn't even a factor for me because my family would likely stop anything from happening before lethality came into things. I just wish there could be a switch to flick and have this all end. I'm so tired of it all. I've had the medications. I've had the years of counselling. I went to Uni. I've had friends. I'm done fighting. I'm tired of putting up the charade.  I've not been truly happy since childhood. I just don't belong in this life. I've struggled to understand it and I'll never fit in. I just want a way out. It hurts so much to stay trapped in it all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/plo2mp/the_only_line_between_life_and_death_for_me_is/", "title": "The only line between life and death for me is the impracticality of suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ingobernables_Ciaran", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631290119, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/plo2mp/the_only_line_between_life_and_death_for_me_is/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427472.3778186, "replies_charged": false}
