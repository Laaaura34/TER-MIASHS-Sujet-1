There is no light at the end of the tunnel. What\u2019s hard is that I wanna be happy, just I think its no longer possible. I\u2019m hoping someone will see, just want a god damn hug man. Someone to tell it\u2019ll be ok and to keep fighting. Life doesn\u2019t seem worth it anymore. I\u2019ve been struggling with anxiety, depression, SH, insomnia and sleep paralysis since I was 12 and SA since I was 15. Recently got diagnosed with ADHD, been put on vyvanse to help with school. Its been rly great to get me more focused. However I\u2019m still as suicidal. Almost took my life last year but thought there was hope. I stopped SA and SH but ever since school started again, its all i can think about. I don\u2019t know what else to do, how to live. I feel like its all I think about. Obviously there are other things going on but this is just a general view. It\u2019s so strange knowing that at any moment i can decide to end it. Just still contemplating if i should.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q1e9kz/what_do_i_do/", "title": "What do I do", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Choice_Reflection566", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633379098, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q1e9kz/what_do_i_do/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426552.1317165, "replies_charged": false}
