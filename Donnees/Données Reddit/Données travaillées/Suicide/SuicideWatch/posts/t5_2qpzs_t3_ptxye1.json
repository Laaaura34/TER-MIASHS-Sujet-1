I already got covid and almost died, which means I can't really afford the risk of going out and dating. The last relationship I had been in was at 19 and that ended bad. I am a virgin but have hand intimacy with girls before, just never actually put my thing in her thing but did all the other fun stuff. I feel my time ran out I'm single and will always be, I will be alone because It's hard for me to get girls. So analyzing I'm a virgin, alone, don't date and can't and still living with parents. It seems like everybody is going to move on with their lives, and I'm going to be left behind, alone. So why should I live, why should I have a life if there is no one to live it with. I don't want to die, but I feel that is the only solution. I'm hurting enormously and just feeling the days go by, knowing that at some point i will have nothing and nobody and if I can't bare the idea know I am damn sure not going to be able to bare the actual feeling in the future, so I might as well end it now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ptxye1/why_should_i_live/", "title": "Why should I live?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "amike664", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632411674, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ptxye1/why_should_i_live/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427981.10013, "replies_charged": false}
