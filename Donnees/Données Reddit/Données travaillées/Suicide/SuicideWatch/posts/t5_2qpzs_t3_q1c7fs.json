I'm just here to challenge the idea that planned methods are the most successful. My impulsive ones have been the most catastrophic. What I mean by that, is when you see these posts saying when someone goes quiet, sells their belongings, makes plans etc they are most likely to follow through because they have accepted their fate. In my own experience I find it to be opposite and only when it is impulsive reaction (I have bpd) is it ever anywhere near fatal.\nMy point is, don't dismiss the impulsive ones as attention seeking, we may not have made such a well made plan but the thoughts are there all the same and deserve the same care and respect from the professionals specifically employed to keep us alive.
