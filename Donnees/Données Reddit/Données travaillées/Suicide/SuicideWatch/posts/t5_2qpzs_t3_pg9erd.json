It scares me to be manic depressive and suicidal but also have a child in a stable family situation. While she\u2019s young I can sort of manage. But as she grows she will start wondering why her dad sucks and isn\u2019t like other dads. Why isn\u2019t her dad remotely successful? Or fun? Or just happy? So is it better for her to deal with a shit parent or is it better for this parent to just die off quickly so she doesn\u2019t endure a bad upbringing. I don\u2019t want my issues to rub off on her like my moms did to me. Had trauma when I was 21. Fucked me up for life. Won\u2019t get better. Had all the pills and doctors. I suck it up and work and pay bills. But mostly just want to not exist and am annoyed as fuck when I wake up each day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pg9erd/better_to_be_a_bad_father_or_be_a_dead_father/", "title": "Better to be a bad father or be a dead father?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pqppqpqqp", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630552103, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pg9erd/better_to_be_a_bad_father_or_be_a_dead_father/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425460.4482293, "replies_charged": false}
