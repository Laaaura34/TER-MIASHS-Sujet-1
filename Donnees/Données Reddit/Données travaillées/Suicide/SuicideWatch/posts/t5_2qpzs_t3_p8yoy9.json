I'm a shitty human being who makes everybody around me miserable sooner or later. My boyfriend/child's father told me at the weekend that he wanted to be with someone else, and it just hit home how shit his life had been with me. Our child doesn't mind that he's leaving, she's looking forward to \"having two mums\" - her saying that just about destroyed me.\n\nSo, when she has her first visitation with them, probably in a few weeks, that's my chance. I've failed at everything else that mattered to me.\n\nI won't fail at this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p8yoy9/just_a_failure_cant_do_it_anymore/", "title": "Just a failure, can't do it anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Charmed-Geek", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629577781, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p8yoy9/just_a_failure_cant_do_it_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426967.1520073, "replies_charged": false}
