Never spoken to a girl before so I'll always be alone.\n\nKnowing all this I still can't be bothered to help myself escape it, I've got the support from family but nothing will change unless I change and we know that's never gonna happen.\n\nGetting thoughts of suicide and a constant wish for it to be over but I couldn't hurt my mom like that, it would break her.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oneswm/unable_to_help_myself/", "title": "Unable to help myself.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BlackenedIchor", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626703814, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oneswm/unable_to_help_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428015.498442, "replies_charged": false}
