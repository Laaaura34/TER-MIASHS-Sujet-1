I didn\u2019t know where to turn to so I called a hotline. The first hotline I called told me they couldn\u2019t help me and referred me to the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. Keep in mind I am in the middle of a psychotic break during all of this. Someone answers the line with a simple greeting at which point I said \u201cI\u2019m not really sure what to say or why I\u2019m here I just feel like I\u2019m going crazy and I need help\u201d I continued to explain my symptoms including paranoia, hallucinations, rambling speech that made no sense, disassociation and so on. At this point the operator told me I \u201csounded sane\u201d and suggested I watch tv to distract myself. I said okay and they hung up after a goodbye. I was extremely triggered by this conversation as I have repeatedly been told in the past that I couldn\u2019t possibly have any mental health issues based on the way I look and talk. I am on 6 different medications and have been struggling with mental illness since I was born. It was very disheartening that the operator could not affirm my feelings as valid and I felt very discarded and alone after this call. Has anyone had a similar experience? Or can simply relate?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o6fbf9/suicide_prevention_hotline_horrible_experience/", "title": "Suicide prevention hotline horrible experience - please help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Caity666", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624462684, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o6fbf9/suicide_prevention_hotline_horrible_experience/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427817.2692816, "replies_charged": false}
