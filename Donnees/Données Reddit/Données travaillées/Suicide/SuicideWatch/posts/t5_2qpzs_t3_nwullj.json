But my husband found me, did CPR, brought me back from the dead. I shouldn't be alive and I definitely shouldn't be able to function as well as I do. People say I'm lucky. I feel slightly lucky given the statistics... I was hanging for 7-15 minutes estimated. *I was in coma for a week tho and have some brain damage but here we are.*\n\nI just honestly feel the same way I did when I made the attempt. I've tried to wanna be here, therapy, meds, but I don't. I don't have a desire to be alive but everyone else wants/needs me here. I've felt this way since I was in kindergarten. I remember my mom telling me not to put plastic grocery bags on my head because I could suffocate and die. That was the first time suicide sounded appealing to me.\n\nAnyways... \n\nI just can't keep being here. I'm not okay just existing and although Ive created a purposeful life, I feel like I'm just existing. I can't just exist everyday. I can't do it anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nwullj/successful_suicide_attempt_thwarted_by_god/", "title": "Successful suicide attempt thwarted by god.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Suspicious-Jump2725", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 182, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623349351, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nwullj/successful_suicide_attempt_thwarted_by_god/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428524.2480745, "replies_charged": false}
