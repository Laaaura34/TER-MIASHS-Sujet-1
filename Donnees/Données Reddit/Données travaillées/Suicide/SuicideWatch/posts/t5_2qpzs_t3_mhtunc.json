I take my time, it surely isn't easy. \nAlso I feel I still have some work to do that I somehow owe others and the rest is preparation of letters and thoughts and stuff. \n\nI pull away from people and mostly talk superficial stuff, because it won't help anymore anyway and it would be a ballast for them. \n\nI really, honestly wish, I could talk to someone about what one does when preparing. But you get so lonely with everthing cause taboo. \nI guess some of you have experienced this. For those who did and then didn't being it to an end, how does this period feel for you now?\n\n\nI mean taboo and thus one has to decide everything alone. Do I throw my stuff away? Is it more of a burden for others, if they need to clean my flat or is it worse if only an empty apartment remains? \n\nI don't know. And I feel a bit overwhelmed with deciding all of this alone. Yes and of course more lonely. The wish to connect over thoughts surrounding suicidality is there, of course.
