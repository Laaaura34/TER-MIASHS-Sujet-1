Looking back, the idea of 30+ more years of *this* just doesn't seem worth doing. I have never spoken about much of this.\n\nWhen I was five I went to a summer camp. I was molested repeatedly over the course of several days. I feel like in that week whatever person I was supposed to become died. What I am now is the leftovers. \n\nI've never been able to relate to people. Never had a healthy relationship and have isolated myself from just about every friend I've ever had. I spend my days alone. I pretend I'm at peace with the prospect of a lifetime like this but I know I'm not. \n\nI have unhealthy sexual relationships and have suffered the consequences. I'm HIV+. I have struggled with crystal meth before and it has made some recent appearances and I'm worried I'm losing control. I don't know if I have another recovery in me.\n\nI was diagnosed Bipolar II. I spend months in some of the worst depression you can imagine. I ache all over. I feel like I've been having a panic attack for the last six months. If I don't ignore people completely I lash out at them. My job is hanging  by a thread and I can barely keep my head above water. No one wants the diseased leftovers anyway.\n\nI can't do this for much longer. \n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2cv0c6/i_think_im_at_my_limit/", "title": "I think I'm at my limit", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "chainsmoking18594", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1407391250, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2cv0c6/i_think_im_at_my_limit/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426326.250801, "replies_charged": false}
