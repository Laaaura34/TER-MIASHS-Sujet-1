I thought depression is for weak people and felt kind of spiteful towards giving into thinking that someone or something dares to be so mighty and important to cause me to take my own life. It's precious, right?\n\nWell, fast forward to like a decade later - just for the sake of clarity and giving enough info, I'm in my thirties - I feel like I am that weakling I used to scoff at. I am not content in the slightest meaning of the word. I feel like I should have bigger issues, more serious problems, a tragic story, solid reasons for what I'm now contemplating. In reality, I have none of the sort. And what has become so crystal clear in the past couple of years to me, is that - it doesn't even matter. It does not matter, I'm indifferent, don't care. I don't have to have a reason or solid proof to back up my depressing, suicidal thoughts. I just don't-want-none-of-this-life-bullshit-anymore.\n\nI have little to no recollection of past events that are supposed to be meaningful, not the good times nor the bad. I forget things, I don't have a clear grasp of my life timeline. It's all hazy, mell-pell fragments of memories. This I consider a symptom of sorts.\n\nI have a pretty strong, and at this point, I feel, very accurate, feeling like I didn't exist for the past 3 decades, in the sense of a meaningful life. Nothing I did matters, I have accomplished nothing in my life. I'm becoming more and more terrified and anxious by each passing day regarding things I somehow once deemed more or less doable. Things I have (even documented!) evidence of once being capable of doing in bigger of smaller capacity, now I feel completely incapable to do. I don't ride my bicycle anymore. I'm terrified of getting behind driver's seat. I dread talking to people (makes my speech impediment act up, which of course fires up anxiety, which of course results with avoidance of interacting all together). I dread having people look at me and seeing through my front.\n\nI'm tired. I don't have any drive or expectations. No plans, no aspirations. I feel like time has ran out on me. It has nothing to do with my age. I feel like I don't really have any purpose for myself, let alone anyone else. I don't know who I am supposed to be and don't like what I'm seeing now.\n\nNow most of this stuff is not a figment of my imagination. I've had people - romantic partners and / or friends - turn away from me because I'm \"empty\". I used to get mad when getting this feedback, but they're not wrong. I now know that perfectly well. I've been a lousy student, an unreliable friend and family member, a flaky emotional partner, a person who cannot hold down or excel at a job - and had done nothing to really change any of that. I'm vain, I'm judgmental, I'm more shallow than I think I am, a lot less talented than I think I am. I'm ultimately disengaged. And I've realized I've spent my whole life trying to hide it and disguise myself behind jokes and fake \"quirkiness\". My persona is a shell and there's nothing of substance behind it. I've tried to dig up something, anything, but there was nothing.\n\nNow, as I've sort of said in the beginning of this post, I've come to terms with how I feel in a sense that I don't care about trying to find the meaning. I'm not even resentful. Not sad, as well. Just - nothing.\n\nAll of this can't be imbalanced chemistry, because how do you fix something that isn't really there?\n\nThis post is, obviously, a kind of train-of-thought / venting post and I understand it's pretty vague regarding factual information. I'd like to keep it that way for now.\n\nWhat's keeping you guys from enjoying nothingness that awaits behind the deed?
