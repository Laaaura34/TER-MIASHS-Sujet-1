I became an alcoholic when I was 19 and I'm 27 now. High-functioning so people always just laughed at how much I could handle but didn't think too much of it. I was depressed all along.\n\nI went to a small college town here in Brazil for a major I didn't want and things got worse. Drinking everyday, failing every class, I reached rock bottom in depression.\n\nI left at my last string because my parents got concerned and I came to live with my grandma at one of our capitals.\n\nShe's depressed and drinking hard liquor every time before bed too, and she has apnea, so I'm always worried about her.\n\nI had an excellent first term in college now, but I could see myself slipping towards the end, with drugs, demotivation and alcohol. I fooled everyone. I made my boyfriend cry over seeing me do a line of cocaine and it crushed me.\n\nI have cheated and I was out of control and he's the best partner I've ever had in my life. Every aspect of my life should be fine, but I sabotage everything lately. I'm fucking myself up and it's always like walking into a haze and watching the aftermath in horror later.\n\nI know I'm a good person, they all deserve the best version or me right now, and it's what it should be, but I go into a different state and when I come back, I have to pick up the pieces!\n\nWhy can't I just accept that my life is okay? Why is my brain doing this? Why do I keep getting more and more attracted to the window when I know it will destroy my grandma? Why do I keep thinking of ways to make me leaving an accident?\n\nPlease, please, please help me. I have anxiety about going to a psychiatrist and opening up, and hearing about ways to get to that consultation and save myself and my relationships could finally release me from this cyclical fucking nightmare...\n\nI can't handle it anymore. I tried so hard... I betrayed someone who has been nothing but perfect with me... I think it got me irreversibly sick... I don't want to do this anymore. Please, please just tell me anything to help me... I want to be a good person... I want to make him happy, and not disappointed... please...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/efu430/selfdestruction/", "title": "Self-destruction", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pleasegivemeanout", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1577357443, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/efu430/selfdestruction/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422539.5767038, "replies_charged": false}
