I told my boss and now it\u2019s even worse. Why the fuck do I do this? I should\u2019ve just gone to work and cried when I get home like I have been. \n\nI fucking hate myself. I can\u2019t be normal. I can\u2019t make friends. I can\u2019t be outgoing. I\u2019m too self-conscious. I\u2019m a little bitch. I\u2019m not good enough. I\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m pretending. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve been doing - PRETENDING - that I can make it through. \n\nI\u2019m a fucking coward, ugly, little bitch.
