I just need to say all of this somewhere because I can\u2019t keep it to myself anymore.\n\nI am a terrible person. I can\u2019t seem to stop making choices that I know are bad and then have to live in the guilt of them. I am destroying relationships and everyday I hate myself more for it. I feel physically ill thinking about the terrible things I\u2019ve done and then keep doing them. I deserve every ounce of what\u2019s coming to me and yet I want so badly to be free of it all. \n\nI feel devoid of all emotions. I used to feel happy and excited for life. I used to connect to people and I felt real love for others. But now I can\u2019t feel any of that. I don\u2019t know why I can love others I don\u2019t know what happened. I wish I could but I just can\u2019t and it\u2019s maddening. I feel like I\u2019m caught in an endless feedback loop of wanting to love but then fucking my relationships with others up. \n\nI\u2019m so indecisive I never know what I want. I struggle to decide on anything and when I do I miraculously make the wrong choice everytime. I want to curl up and never have to affect anyone ever again.\n\nI can\u2019t talk about how I feel to anyone. I don\u2019t have anyone I feel like I can trust to talk to. Trying to be vulnerable makes me feel physically ill and talking about my problems makes me upset. I don\u2019t want to be seen as weak but I can\u2019t hold it in anymore. Yet I have nobody to tell so here I am on a throw away. \n\nI want to be liked so badly but somehow I\u2019m both abrasive and boring at the same time. I feel like there\u2019s two people in me constantly struggling to win yet both are equally unhealthy. I almost feel like I\u2019m a third person watching those two fight for supremacy while never being in control. I don\u2019t even feel alive most the time. I feel like I\u2019m just watching as my body moves through life on its own in some sort of dream like state. \n\nI can never grow into the shoes of my idols. They would never make the mistakes I have made. They wouldn\u2019t hurt people like I do. I\u2019m a failure and will never be the people I look up to. They\u2019d be embarrassed to even have me as a fan.\n\nThe worst part is I don\u2019t know why I do the things I do or why I don\u2019t feel anything. I just  want some point of reference but I have nothing. I have no idea why I feel this way and it\u2019s the most infuriating thing in life. I want to tear apart everything around and try to force everything out of myself. I have no hope for the future. Nothing sounds like it\u2019ll make me happy. All I see in the future is more numbness and more neuroticism. Nothing will ever get better because this is just the way I am now.\n\nDeath doesn\u2019t scare me anymore. The idea of it brings some sort of peace to my mind. It feels like it\u2019d solve a lot of people\u2019s problems. Especially the more grisly and violent it is on my body. The only thing that\u2019s topping me is the fact that my parents would miss me for some reason but I\u2019ve thinking about it so much lately", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mcs8mk/devoid_of_everything_and_no_longer_afraid_of_death/", "title": "Devoid of everything and no longer afraid of death", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GruThrowAways", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616655803, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mcs8mk/devoid_of_everything_and_no_longer_afraid_of_death/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426644.0529146, "replies_charged": false}
