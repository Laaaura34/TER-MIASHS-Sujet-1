Please do not blame yourselves, I love you. Take the time you need to be sad, and then move on. Keep living. Please. \n \nIt is my dying wish that you do not post any of our individual/private photos/memories online as an homage to me... If you knew me, you know that I would NOT want that.  If I have not shared it personally already, I did not want it public. Thank you.\n\nI am NOT interested in having a funeral, I INSIST you respect this wish as well. No burial, cremation will suffice.\n\nThe most important and final thing I ask of my friends and loved ones is to pray that God may have mercy on my soul \u2014 as this one sin I\u2019m unable to repent.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q3ab8h/here_is_my_note_doing_it_tonight/", "title": "Here is my note, doing it tonight.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "justathrowawayokay1", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 81, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633616938, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q3ab8h/here_is_my_note_doing_it_tonight/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425175.822574, "replies_charged": false}
