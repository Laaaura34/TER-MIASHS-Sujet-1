I didn't kill myself because for months I thought my life was at least bringing her happiness. She told me tonight that I don't make her actually happy. I now have no purpose. I make the lives of everyone around me worse. I have a nice brand new sharp knife. I'm considering if I should take my dad's oxycodone pills then plunge my knife into my femoral artery. I hate this world. I just wish I had a purpose.\n\nIf I'm not active tomorrow I'm either hospitalized or those around me got lucky and I passed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o3cb3a/genuinely_considering_another_suicide_attempt/", "title": "Genuinely considering another suicide attempt.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "-Flizbri", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624095553, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o3cb3a/genuinely_considering_another_suicide_attempt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428582.7051167, "replies_charged": false}
