However, I can swear up & down each feels different than the last, each feels like \"The One\" that I am able to act on, to finally ascend through death. It's a pitfalling feeling of hopelessness that leaves me bitter and in disarray. Attempting to practice physically safe regulated self destruction is meaningless at this point. It offers short lived relief until I'm just numb with anger at the futility of myself. I'm angry at what I have not been able to accomplish in the past, I'm angry at my fear keeping me from accomplishing death in the present. I'm angry and empty. I'm throwing my life into chaos willingly and as it is already. I need some sort of help.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/77wude/nauseous_melancholy/", "title": "Nauseous Melancholy", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "caluiflowerbrain", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1508628858, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/77wude/nauseous_melancholy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427505.44265, "replies_charged": false}
