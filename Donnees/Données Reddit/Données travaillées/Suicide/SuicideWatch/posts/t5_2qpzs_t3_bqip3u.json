I finally started getting more hours at work and I\u2019m forcing myself to function but I hate my job and it\u2019s stressing me out and stress makes me sick to my stomach and then I can\u2019t work and then I call out and lose hours and money and hurt my reputation with my employers...  I want to change departments but I have too much anxiety and I can\u2019t even get up the nerve to talk to my managers... I\u2019m never going to get anywhere like this, I can barely pay my insurance and phone bill, I hate my body but I can\u2019t stop eating junk and gaining weight, I keep disappointing my boyfriend and my parents with this work stuff and I just want to kill myself. I\u2019m so tired of trying so hard and getting to a better place just to ruin everything for myself.. I don\u2019t know what to do I\u2019m never going to advance if I keep doing this and if I quit my job I can\u2019t pay my bills..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bqip3u/i_cant_stop_myself_from_being_self_destructive/", "title": "I can\u2019t stop myself from being self destructive", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Vault111Dweller_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1558282439, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bqip3u/i_cant_stop_myself_from_being_self_destructive/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422557.1188073, "replies_charged": false}
