I will get enamored with someone and put 100% into making them feel loved, but i always feel like i get less than half back. i know i shouldn\u2019t love with the expectation to get something back, but it\u2019s so difficult for this to happen over and over. \n\ni was interested in a friend a few years ago, he seemed to like me too, but was very closed off emotionally. i gues that should have been my first clue. we had a lot of fun together and could talk back and forth for hours. he came over once for my birthday and we spent the day watching movies, i cuddled up to him, he hugged me twice when he had to leave. i was so nervous but i was so happy. but nothing ever came of it. he was still closed off. and i find out later that he just did it to make me happy. and that he mostly just felt uncomfortable. i still feel embarrassed and stupid for it being such a happy memory. i don\u2019t know why i\u2019m lied to like this. as if giving me pity affection and then telling me it didn\u2019t mean anything hurts less than not doing it in the first place.\n\nive also been a placeholder for a different guy when his relationship with his girlfriend was falling apart. two separate times, 4 years apart. i don\u2019t know how i was stupid enough to let it happen again.\n\ni just want to be wanted. i want someone to put in the same effort as me. instead of giving me the emotional equivalent of bread crumbs. i\u2019m so scared to touch anyone because i\u2019m afraid they\u2019re only doing it to make themselves feel better about feeling nothing for me. my self esteem and confidence are nonexistent. ive cried so hard, it\u2019s almost 2am. im so tired of being alive when i\u2019m not happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q95xli/i_want_to_be_wanted/", "title": "i want to be wanted", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "goblinfancies", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634363209, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q95xli/i_want_to_be_wanted/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423142.9988635, "replies_charged": false}
