It\u2019s cathartic, addictive, and serves a purpose of punishing myself for being the shit human that in those moments I feel I am.\nIn a weird way, it\u2019s kind of comforting - it serves as a distraction from thinking about whatever overwhelmed me. A part of me likes to indulge in escapism, and that\u2019s just one of the forms. I\u2019m not in actual danger though; when I start to plan out the details it gets too messy, there\u2019s too much to take into consideration to try and limit the trauma my death would leave on the people around me. Eventually it too becomes too overwhelming to think about, so I look for another distraction. \nThe way I presented it might seem like it\u2019s not that much of a problem, but I suspect it is this habit that set me back in life by a lot - I spent the majority of my childhood and all of my teenage years convinced I wouldn\u2019t live past 20, maybe 22. It didn\u2019t make sense to make long term plans. Now I\u2019m past that age and largely decided to live, also took up some commitments. Still however have my relapses when I look at my thoughts, deem myself pathetic, disgusting, or stupid, and it feels tempting to just delete my whole being to save myself further embarrassment.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q18qqt/i_compulsively_fantasise_of_suicide/", "title": "I compulsively fantasise of suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LinguPingu", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633364301, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q18qqt/i_compulsively_fantasise_of_suicide/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635425548.6597383, "replies_charged": false}
