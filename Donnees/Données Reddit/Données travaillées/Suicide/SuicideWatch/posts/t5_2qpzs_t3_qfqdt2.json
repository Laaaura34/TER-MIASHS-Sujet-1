I'm in pain and can't keep going anymore.\n\nI am extremely lonely and anxious. I spend all my days in my small apartment without speaking to anyone. Been applying to jobs/school for years but I'm just not good enough for anything. I have lots of interests, but I don't want to continue this lonely lifestyle.\n\nMy dad committed suicide when I was little. My mom was abusive alcoholic with narcissistic traits so I don't speak to her. All my life I've been trying to be nice to people and make friends but it seems that everywhere I go people just hate me. I'm on antidepressants but I don't think they're helping anymore. Ever since I was little I have always wanted to kill myself. My life has no point. I'm going to live lonely and miserable life or I can just kill myself now.\n\nSorry about the grammar mistakes.
