I tried the same method as last time but tried weighing myself down. Still didn't work, I was barely in there for 5 seconds before my Body got me it. The chlorine burning my nose was enough for my Survival Instincts to override my Brain. I just want to die, fuck this Society and these Survival Instincts. I know that no one cares that I survived, but jesus christ I wish I could just leave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill though, despite my pathetic attempt; I'm glad I tried. At least now I know that method was never going to work and can search for others in the future.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/okqxca/i_had_my_second_suicide_attempt_yesterday/", "title": "I had my Second Suicide Attempt yesterday", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DanGaming_Reddit", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626348540, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/okqxca/i_had_my_second_suicide_attempt_yesterday/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428551.2662382, "replies_charged": false}
