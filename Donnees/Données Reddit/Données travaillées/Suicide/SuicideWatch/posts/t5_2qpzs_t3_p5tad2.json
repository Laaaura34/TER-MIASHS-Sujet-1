One night after a particularly bad fight with my parents, I took a razor blade and sat fully clothed in an empty bathtub with the intention of killing myself. I ran the blade up my inner arm about 7 times, hoping that eventually it would be deep enough and I would die. I ended up just sobbing in the tub because it wouldn\u2019t work. The cuts faded and now they are so faded and white that you can only see them if you look hard. I don\u2019t know if the blade just wasn\u2019t sharp enough or I was subconsciously too afraid to do it, even though I really wanted to.\n\nDoes this count as a suicide attempt if I didn\u2019t have to go to the hospital or it didn\u2019t almost kill me?\nIdk if this is the right place to post this. Let me know if it\u2019s not.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p5tad2/is_this_considered_a_suicide_attempt/", "title": "Is this considered a suicide attempt?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DetailLegitimate2441", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629161602, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p5tad2/is_this_considered_a_suicide_attempt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428544.2004728, "replies_charged": false}
