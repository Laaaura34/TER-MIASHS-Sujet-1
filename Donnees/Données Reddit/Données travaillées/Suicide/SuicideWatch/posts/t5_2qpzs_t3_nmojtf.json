I'm at the end of college, no friends, I'm an anchor on the ankle of my partner, and I've squandered 4k of my own parents hard earned money on a shitty degree in a field I despise. I'm a compulsive liar, and the moment my partner finds out I'll be out of her life. So they can find someone they deserve.\n\nEverytime I see something fast on the street, or a long drop, something nudges me towards it. I've been imagining how I could easiest end up in front of a fast truck or train. Bashing my hands and head into a wall isn't enough to curb the need to punish myself anymore. \n\nI need a way to disconnect from the people in my life. As soon as I have money, I'll disappear to somewhere in Russia or Taiwan, and die somewhere quiet.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nmojtf/i_feel_a_slow_pull_towards_danger_and_having_an/", "title": "I feel a slow pull towards danger and having an \"accident\".
