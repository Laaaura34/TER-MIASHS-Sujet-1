I\u2019ve been having a lot of trouble with myself lately. I had an awful home life growing up with an abusive father and complacent mother. Mental health was heavily neglected and I\u2019ve only really seen a therapist once I\u2019ve been kicked out, diagnosed with PTSD, ADHD, and MDD. I used to have problems with self harm, but that was typically during panic attacks. I would scratch my wrist compulsively until my skin tore for several minutes. I didn\u2019t consciously reason this at the time, but my therapist and I determined it was a \u201cpunishment\u201d for myself for staying in the cycle of abuse with my father believing each event that was much worse than the last would be his \u201cwake up call\u201d. I hated myself and felt stupid for being so empathetic to such a terrible person. I haven\u2019t self harmed in the past 6 months as I don\u2019t see much of a point for that anymore, I also haven\u2019t had any panic attacks since then.\n\nI was kicked out at 18 when I came out as trans (MtF) and moved in with a friend I had met at college. Mostly all contact was cut with my family and I was pretty much on my own with my friend supporting me. I had already pretty much completed my AA because of dual enrollment opportunities and had a full ride to a BA. I didn\u2019t end up following through with these opportunities because of how fucked up my mental state was. A few months later, I had found a boyfriend who ended up having BPD, and I was thrown back into an abusive relationship when I moved in with him and my friend and was locked into a year long contract. I don\u2019t want to get into the specifics, but he had no financial management, blew all of my money and his on random shit, and at the end of the year when he renewed his lease and I hadn\u2019t, he screamed me out of the house immediately. My friend and I were homeless for a month before we found a new place. I let him guilt trip me when he threatened to kill himself if I didn\u2019t leave the car for a few months. Just found out last week the car was pretty much destroyed. \n\nThe new place I\u2019m in is actually quite nice and stable, my friend still lives with me and my other roommates are reliable. I\u2019ve developed feelings for the friend that I\u2019ve lived with for the past almost 3 years, we\u2019ve had sex a few times but I ended up kind of romantically rejected by him.\n\nI guess I find myself in a place where I feel like I have nowhere to go. It\u2019s surprising I\u2019m having suicidal ideation, I\u2019ve had an existential fear of death since I was like 10. I\u2019ve just recently become more comfortable with dying, especially when I binge drink. I\u2019m not an alcoholic with dependency issues, it\u2019s just that when I drink I tend to drink a lot. The last time I drank 6 vodka shots, I felt comfortable with dying. I didn\u2019t really want to try anymore, and felt at peace. It wasn\u2019t the spiteful feeling I expected to feel if I ever found myself here. I drank again tonight and felt the same feeling. I would\u2019ve felt peaceful killing myself at that moment. It isn\u2019t anything related to gender dysphoria, I\u2019ve been on hormones for a year now and I\u2019m actually really comfortable with my body now. It just feels like my life isn\u2019t going anywhere. I find myself chasing these dreams of finding the perfect person, having an amazing career, and I\u2019ve kept myself going by following my own delusions. I chase them only to be disappointed every single time, then I cope by finding a new one. Every day now seems to bleed into the next and I don\u2019t really have anything unique in life anymore. I hardly can ever remember what I\u2019ve done in the past week. \n\nI\u2019ve been incredibly apprehensive getting on anti depressants, but I think that\u2019s me being self destructive at this point. Maybe I\u2019ve subconsciously pushed myself down this route. But my friends would be destroyed, my siblings would be too. I\u2019m really ignorant about anti depressants and I just want to hear how it\u2019s helped other people, just the general process, how it\u2019s helped anyone here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pp914q/having_suicidal_thoughts_just_kind_of_wondering/", "title": "Having suicidal thoughts, just kind of wondering how antidepressants have worked for anyone here.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ThrowAwayy8624", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631779537, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pp914q/having_suicidal_thoughts_just_kind_of_wondering/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635427367.2067022, "replies_charged": false}
