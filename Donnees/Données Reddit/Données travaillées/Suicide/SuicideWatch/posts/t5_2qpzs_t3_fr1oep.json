I was sexually abused by my mother\u2019s father when I was younger and I have been trying to work through that trauma for the last four years. \nI have never really had anyone that I could truly trust and rely on for emotional support until I started dating my ex 3 years ago. We were friends for a long time before hand and I honestly thought I would marry him. Over the last year he has been really unhappy in our relationship and started to break my trust. \n\nI finally decided we would both be better off if I ended things. I am really struggling right now and I just want to end it all. I don\u2019t have anyone left in my life that I feel like I can trust. I am scared about dying but I just don\u2019t know how much longer I can deal with this kind of pain", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fr1oep/i_dont_want_to_die_i_just_want_to_be_free/", "title": "I don\u2019t want to die, I just want to be free", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "9753-8642", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1585464987, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fr1oep/i_dont_want_to_die_i_just_want_to_be_free/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422945.3257973, "replies_charged": false}
