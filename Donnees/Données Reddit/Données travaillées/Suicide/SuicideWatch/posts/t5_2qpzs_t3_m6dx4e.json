I had a real life but I gave up on it when my brother died from autoerotic asphyxiation. You might hear that 1000s of people die from this every year but you never hear any awareness or fundraising about it (besides people like George Carlin making fun of it), because my family and me is part of the problem.\n\nWhen my brother died we made a pact to keep the real cause of death to immediate family. Not even extended family like my cousins could know, only my mom, myself, his best friend, the police and the coroner. My mom thought this would be the best for everyone, since we did not want to damage his legacy with final images to family members that he died in a self-gratifying way. You have no idea how impossibly frustrating it is to not even talk about how your own brother died. It's always a lie, that \"he died choking while eating in bed\". As if that is supposed to give my extended family some sense of comfort, the lie that he might've actually suffered while dying instead of... the way he did, unable to free himself from the seat belt while unconscious. What if I think the truth is a lot more comforting than the lie?\n\nI am very jealous of my brother. He died in such a painless way that he wouldnt even know he is dead. Every day I wonder if he even knows. Every day I wonder that all he needed to save his life was a wristwatch or something to call the ambulance when he has no pulse... why isn't that even a common thing for autoerotic users?? Even over a year later I go to bed every day hoping that I do not wake up. I hate myself for being grateful that my brother \"died all the way\" instead of being found minutes earlier and left in a vegetative state only forcing us to the decision of \"pulling the plug\" or w/e. The only thing I am genuinely grateful for is that my brother died all the way and at the same time I am so jealous of the way he died and want the same for myself.\n\nMy mom has dementia and I see her fading away from me bit by bit every day, and this terrifies me more than I can describe since I have a long history of hard drives failing on me and losing data (family photos and stuff) so much that losing my brother and sometime my mom is... I feel desensitized to loss. Sometimes I even miss the hard drive more than my brother, and I loved my brother, he was absolutely selfless and only cared about me. He left a wealthy enough estate and we have a lot of money we do not want. I have cried only twice since he died and that last time ago was before the pandemic started. I want to cry but I only feel it taking a toll on other parts of my body. Ever since I was a kid we had taken on stray cats and I had watched my best friends die by the dozens over my ~30 years. I am so desensitized to death and loss that I dont feel anything anymore and when I do end up losing what little I have left I think I will regret what I do next if I dont do it fully.\n\nThen theres the pandemic. Not even 3 months of a breather or even a chance for therapy (which I was offered) since my brother died then my mom and entire family are suddenly at risk of dying so we burrow indoors for an entire year. I have not been outside for a year. I see the sun everyday but through a backyard window. I had found recluse and honestly a replacement life in an online RPG and played it long enough to make more friends than I could count, completed lots of quests and skilled. It was not a distraction, it something I would have continued to love doing instead of life. The last few weeks have been a nightmare because their servers or something (they don't care to communicate effectively at all, just the usual PR BS) failed, their backups failed, and they lost my and maybe 1000s of other accounts. They are saying something about recoverying accounts from telemetry and a \"integrity review\" but ive not been able to even escape my life for weeks and people are saying we dont even know the worst of it yet. For a company that prides itself in mental health awareness they do not care about my mental wellbing at all.\n\nI used to want kids when I got older, but all Ive realized the last few years is how messed up my family and bloodline is, the world has enough strain and misfortune than for me to ever bring someone else into this shit. I was never good at my own data but even relying on others with my data isnt working. The \"cloud\" is the biggest lie out there. I read a lot about Japanese literature and stuff, that suicide is honorable. I was raised under God and believing in the afterlife, but after so much of this I do not believe it and have no hope of believing it, and when I was in my teens my dad died on my living room floor from drug overdose, so this is just how I am supposed to go. He already failed it once years earlier when we heard a thud in the bathroom tub just as my mom were about to leave I think to get dinner, but this illness will eventually get whoever it wants. People like me are not cut out for the real world or the fake.\n\nSorry I just need to vent at least I am too tired to do anything more today", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m6dx4e/real_life_was_never_my_thing_and_now_my_fake_life/", "title": "Real life was never my thing and now my fake life is being erased in front of me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hadagoodtime32", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615914461, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m6dx4e/real_life_was_never_my_thing_and_now_my_fake_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427746.3612435, "replies_charged": false}
