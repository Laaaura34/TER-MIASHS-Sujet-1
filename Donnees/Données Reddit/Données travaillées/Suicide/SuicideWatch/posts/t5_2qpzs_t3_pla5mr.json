My dad and stepmom are the opposite of supportive. They treat me like an underperforming employee. I\u2019m not exaggerating; they treat my illness as if they were my boss at work and not my family. \n\nDad literally just responded to me opening up about my struggles with \u201cthat won\u2019t fly in the business world,\u201d and that \u201cnobody cares, nobody cares about your health but you.\u201d He added that stepmom\u2019s boss gets seizures when he sees flashing lights and still manages to be a VP.\n\nAfter years of being treated horribly by my parents I now want to cut my dad and step mom out of my life except I fear what my life would become without their financial security blanket. I work full time and still can\u2019t afford rent anywhere even if I have a roommate.\n\nI hate living. I hate that I work 40+ hours a week and I\u2019m too poor for housing. I hate my disease. I hate that I can\u2019t function when it flares up. I hate that every medication I\u2019ve tried only works for a few months and then it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019ve been afraid to try suicide because I don\u2019t want my life to get worse.\n\nI\u2019ve heard dehydration is painless after the first few days, and it\u2019s just a matter of will power. If I stop drinking it\u2019s lethal after a week and a half.\n\nWhat else do you do when there\u2019s no way out and even medication doesn\u2019t work?
