Nothing. I just felt in the abyss of fear and anxiety. Agoraphobic. Scared of facing this sad reality where nobody cares about me and doesn't even know my name. I am invisible. My family doesn't even like to talk to me. I don't see my parents often and i made them extremely disappointed. I crave physical contact so much, you don't know how much i would like to hug somebody right now and cry till my last breath is out. I am a pathetic man, a monster for killing a big part of my life and making me depressed and suicidal.
