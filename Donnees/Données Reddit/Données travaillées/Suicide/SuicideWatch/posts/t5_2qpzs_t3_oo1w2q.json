I tried to cut some of my blood vessels open, but my scissors weren\u2019t sharp enough. I ended up bleeding down my leg but it stopped after a few minutes. I probably lost about 10-15 mL of blood. Does this count as a suicide attempt, or is this suicidal self harm?\n\nThank you for any input in advance. I love you all, and know that you\u2019re all beautiful people.\n\n<3\n\nOctoHelm", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oo1w2q/does_this_count_as_a_suicide_attempt/", "title": "Does this count as a suicide attempt?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "OctoHelm", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626787194, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oo1w2q/does_this_count_as_a_suicide_attempt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428580.3573503, "replies_charged": false}
