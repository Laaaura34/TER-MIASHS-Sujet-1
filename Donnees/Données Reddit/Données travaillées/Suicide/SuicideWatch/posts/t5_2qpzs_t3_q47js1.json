But I still pour my heart out with compassion every day 9-5, on call every other night. I went to the ER the other night after transferring the body of a young man, my son's age, who died from suicide. Gruesome, even for me. \nThe ER doc told me, when I was afraid I might kill myself, \"hey, we all die!\" \nNo shit, Sherlock. And lied to me about 3 other things related to my health. the look on his face when he realized I wasn't the \"stupid pos\" he assumed he was talking to made it almost worth the heartbreak. \nBut the entire experience made me realize that I am, in fact, done with this existence.
