I have been in the psych ward a few times, and had a pretty specific plan for suicide. I am not \u201cactively\u201d suicidal, but I do think about death for myself a lot. I am diagnosed Bipolar 1, and and very depressed. Currently on lithium, but the down days are still here and very real. Anything and everything impacts my mood. Even watching a sad tik tok can send me spiraling, as it has done tonight. I guess I just want to know, is this my life now? Is this how I\u2019m always going to be and feel? It\u2019s so draining. And I don\u2019t know how long I can fake it till I make it. I just feel so lost and alone. I can\u2019t talk to my friends because they will freak out. Can\u2019t talk to family because same. I have a therapist but nothing she says helps.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q1lhs9/suicidal_ideation/", "title": "Suicidal Ideation?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CP13_CP131982", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633401201, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q1lhs9/suicidal_ideation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428717.3712764, "replies_charged": false}
