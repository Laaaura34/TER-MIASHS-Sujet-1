I feel like i love life but sometimes i just get this thought of commiting suicide without a particular reason. It just comes out of nothing and I can just snap out of it by rethinking, but it just feels right in that moment. I never had such thoughts when I was depressed. I dont drink/do drugs and I never attemped to commit suicide or had an idea how to do it. I researched the internet but every page just links suicide to depression/trauma/feeling pain.
