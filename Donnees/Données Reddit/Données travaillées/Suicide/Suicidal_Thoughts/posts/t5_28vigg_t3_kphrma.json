My friends have distanced themselves from me because I told them how I want to kill myself in graphic detail. My girlfriend left me and threatened to send me to a mental hospital because she easily could with the text messages I sent her about how I\u2019d take my life. All my friends and girlfriend say I\u2019m just suicidal for attention and that makes me come even closer to ending my life. They know I have a cutting problem, they think I just want people to feel bad for me. The truth is, I\u2019m fucking being destroyed by manic depression, constant suicidal thoughts, and drug use. I plan to go sober soon but It\u2019s going to be so hard because drugs are my coping mechanism. I really want my relationship and friendships to become better. I want my mental health to be better. I\u2019ve started seeing a therapist 2x a week. I\u2019m on a cocktail of strong meds (lamictal 300 mg, gabapentin 300mg, vraylar) I plan to get sober on my birthday in a few days and have one last drink and one last dmt trip before I go sober. I want to go sober forever it will work wonders for my mental health and friendships because when I do drugs or drink I get manic depression, anxiety, and paranoia. It\u2019s a process but I\u2019m really trying to not kill myself even though I have nothing to live for and I hate myself. I\u2019m going to start going to recovery meetings, I have 4 jobs to keep me occupied. I\u2019m going to get back in the gym and eat healthier, and play billiards more and try to make new friends that understand me. It\u2019s just a process that takes time and I\u2019m in this alone w no support. I have no family, my friends are annoyed at me because I\u2019m suicidal and my girlfriend thinks I\u2019m fucking nuts. Life is fucking hard and for some reason I choose to wake up everyday", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/kphrma/everyone_says_im_just_seeking_attention/", "title": "Everyone says I\u2019m just seeking attention...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NSHV1LL3", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609666452, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/kphrma/everyone_says_im_just_seeking_attention/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429228.3553374, "replies_charged": false}
