No will power to get fit.\nNo one would care if I died.\n\nIf many of the people I know read this list they\u2019d tell me parts of it weren\u2019t true, some might even be as delusional as to tell me none of it is. I don\u2019t know whether these people are lying to me or themselves. \n\nIm ugly, I am ugly in objectively almost every way, no one has ever once found me attractive.\nNow you can say attractiveness is subjective, I guess that\u2019s true but no one exists who\u2019d think I\u2019m good looking \n\nI\u2019m fat, objectively in every way I\u2019m fat, majority of the weight on my body is comprised of fat and I am on the high end of a BMI index.\n\nI have no friends, the most controversial on the list. So many people would say they\u2019re my friend but it\u2019s not true, none of them want to see me, want to talk to me, they just do it. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s out of pity or if they get some self fulfilment out of it or genuinely just have a different definition of friend. The best way to sum up this would be: if in a holiday of 12 weeks I didn\u2019t message any of them none of them would message me.\n\nNo one has ever loved me romantically, realistically there\u2019re two people who could argue to have \u201cloved\u201d me. Neither are genuine. Obvious for many, many reasons.\n\nI\u2019ve never once been someone\u2019s best friend, I don\u2019t even think a soul in the course of humanity could argue this point. No one would ever call me there best friend.\n\nNo one ever wants to talk or see me, I feel I\u2019ve explained this already but pretty much no one would ever come to me in a million years to meet up or talk.\n\nNo one cares about me, maybe a tad dramatic, my family obviously care about me but they\u2019re obliged too so pretty sure it doesn\u2019t count. Some of the people I know may say they care about me but that\u2019s only in there own subjective way. They don\u2019t want me to be hurt or die, that\u2019s not caring about me, that\u2019s good human nature, I don\u2019t want anyone I know to be hurt or die.\n\nI\u2019ve never accomplished anything in my life, I\u2019m in no way talented, no exaggeration to these which is really sad. \n\nWeak of mind and body, like I said I\u2019m fat, not overweight, being overweight can be healthy it can be muscle, but I\u2019m just fat, fat and weak. And if I has will power or psychological strength id be able to change this.\n\nNo one would care if I died. Now, definitely an exaggeration. My family would be sad definitely but only because they HAVE to be, if you live with anyone for they\u2019re whole life and they don\u2019t do anything wrong to you obviously you\u2019ll be sad when they die. Some of the people who know me might force themselves to be sad but within I\u2019d say a calculated 9 months everyone would be past it, they\u2019d be sad maybe out of guilt or just because they think they should be.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/j4nbvh/worthless/", "title": "worthless", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RI0000", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601761255, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/j4nbvh/worthless/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428901.0788188, "replies_charged": false}
