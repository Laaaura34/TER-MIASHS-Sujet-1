And i'm such a burden to them. All I do is complain or annoy them, and whenever I try to distance myself because of the guilt, I end up failing because I need closure. My family can barely afford this nice neighborhood yet my grades suck and I can't get myself to do work. I'm ugly, annoying, dumb, talent-less, and I feel like such a burden. I don't have any goals in the future except for starving myself. I feel like I don't deserve to feel this way, others have gone through so much more pain yet they're more grateful and positive than me. \n\nI know how to be happy. Things were actually going kind-of good. But how do I stay happy? Why do I always feel the same in the end? How do I end the loop?\n\nI really don't see why I should keep on living. I just don't really see the point anymore.\n\nSry for ranting, just needed to let that out.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jfv03t/im_a_burden/", "title": "I'm a burden", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Frogs_in_hats", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603350973, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jfv03t/im_a_burden/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429082.2427921, "replies_charged": false}
