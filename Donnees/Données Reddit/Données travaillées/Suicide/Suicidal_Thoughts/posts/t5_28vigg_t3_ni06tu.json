I am really depressed.\n\nI live far from family, and I have no friends. I am in a relationship that has gone to shit and I\u2019m constantly reminded of how shitty I make my partner. She wants me out on a daily basis, I have no where to go.\n\nI am in about 50,000 worth of debt, that even if I move back home I will be responsible for and I would have to take at least a 10 dollar pay cut because my career just doesn\u2019t make enough there (cost of living is way different). Plus my work is paying for my college right now which I wouldn\u2019t get there.\n\nI feel so ugly and disgusting..\n\nI have no one to talk to. I\u2019m just lost and so fucking sad; there\u2019s a very tall bridge here that I could jump from. The thought plays out in my mind all the time.
