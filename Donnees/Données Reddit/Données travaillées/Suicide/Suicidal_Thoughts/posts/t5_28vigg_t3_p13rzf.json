I was living on a small island for 10 months and some shitty things happened that had me feeling drained/traumatized. At night especially I have a lot of suicidal thoughts. I would never actually do that because I wouldn\u2019t want to hurt my friends and family. It sucks because I feel like I\u2019m basically only staying alive for my friend and family but I\u2019m so sad that I\u2019d rather not be. I feel so tired everyday and it takes me so much energy to do basic things. Some days are better and I\u2019ll go out and do photography which makes me feel better. I\u2019ve also been hanging out with me best friend a lot lately because she\u2019s moving to DC on august 12th. Also for some reason every she and my family does annoys me lately. In general I\u2019ve been feeling very irritable about small things. I think I\u2019m also stressed about my masters and if I\u2019ll get in the program I want. I really want to just start my masters right now but I have to apply now and start a year later. There are things that make me happy in life and that I\u2019m looking forward to but those things seem so far away. It sucks because I feel like I have to stay alive but I feel so miserable so what\u2019s the point. Also my life is a lot easier than other people I know so it makes me feel bad that I have so much privilege but still feel so sad and lazy/tired all the time. It makes me feel like I\u2019m ungrateful and unable to handle the smallest things life throws at me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p13rzf/dont_see_the_point_of_anything_so_exhausted/", "title": "Don\u2019t see the point of anything, so exhausted", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SituationZestyclose1", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628523096, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p13rzf/dont_see_the_point_of_anything_so_exhausted/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429255.386779, "replies_charged": false}
