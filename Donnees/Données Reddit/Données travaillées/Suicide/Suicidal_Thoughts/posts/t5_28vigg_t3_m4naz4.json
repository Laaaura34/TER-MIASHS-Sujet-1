I was only 14, but for a long time before and even for a long time after I didn't see any purpose in my life.\n\nI'm still paying for it now. Most people I know have aspirations, dreams of who they'll be once they finish uni or when they've got their family built in the next decade or less. I wasn't anticipating being around so I never made any of those plans. \n\nJust like salt in a wound, it stings when I remember how all my step mother done at the time was make a fb status when I was in hospital tagging me saying about how she was hungry and bored. \n\nSome of the bad habits that I developed from those years of relentless self loathing still stick around and I kick myself mentally anytime they show again. \n\nOnly reason I didn't try again in the years closer to that day was because I just thought I was a failure, even in death.  \n\nI'm not in that mindset now, I pulled myself out of that environment and mindset for years and it's not all better no, but I know for sure it's not even a fraction as bad as it used to be. It just upsets me so much to think back and realise how dark and empty I felt for so long. \n\nI'll never get my youth back, and that kills me. I had to grow up too fast and it sucks that I was so alone and trapped that I genuinely felt that I had no one to turn to.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/m4naz4/its_been_6_years/", "title": "It's been 6 years...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lanixoxx", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615694132, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/m4naz4/its_been_6_years/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429354.2997642, "replies_charged": false}
