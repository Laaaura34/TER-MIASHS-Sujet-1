I can\u2019t take it anymore I\u2019m tired and drained. It\u2019s always one thing after another and I\u2019m so tired. I\u2019m in a constant cycle of stress, anger, sadness, and full of suicidal thoughts. I want to just fucking end it already. The only things holding me back is that I\u2019m scared of what comes after death and I don\u2019t have access to anything that\u2019ll kill me quickly and painlessly. I need to kill myself I do not want to be here anymore. I see no point in being alive with all this stress and emotions. What\u2019s the end goal? What am I doing this all for? My head is all over the place and I just need it to stop. I\u2019m so fucking tired everyday is the same and I just can\u2019t do it. All I can do is sit here and cut myself and do anything I can to harm myself and fantasize about my death. I want to gain enough courage to just slit my throat or drown myself in the bath tub but I can\u2019t even do that.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jbyc53/im_tired/", "title": "I\u2019m tired", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "milk_tea4", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1602802979, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jbyc53/im_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429166.300359, "replies_charged": false}
