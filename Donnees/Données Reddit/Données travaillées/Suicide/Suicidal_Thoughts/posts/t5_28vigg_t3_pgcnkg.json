I\u2019m not going to commit suicide in the foreseeable future because I\u2019m too much of a coward to face physical pain, but at least death is inevitable at some point, right? Maybe I just need to be patient. I\u2019m not in emotional agony, at least not at the moment. Right now I\u2019m mostly just emotionally exhausted from trying so hard to achieve what I want in life and live in peace. Trying to keep everything in my life balanced is exhausting and it\u2019s almost impossible for me to enjoy anything.
