I have severe trust issues from a rough 5 years within high school and I'm scared to tell anyone in real life, and online learning hasn't been the best for me and I haven't been doing the best mentally wise either, and my subjects dropped, and my mum found out, and I'm trying so hard to gain myself again and do the best and get all grades so I can get the hell out of this house, because I've been mentally and physically hurt since childhood from my parents. And when my mother found out today she just told me to kill myself and I'm a complete failure and something just shattered within me, I am trying so hard not to give up and actually end it all but I am shaking, I am shaking that I truly know that no one is actually left for me. I am so sorry if I'm sounding like I'm speaking bullshit I actually don't know what to do and I'm crying and shaking so badly right now", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lsy7xf/i_want_to_let_go_forever/", "title": "I want to let go forever", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ICTTech_s", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614347996, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lsy7xf/i_want_to_let_go_forever/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429349.232994, "replies_charged": false}
