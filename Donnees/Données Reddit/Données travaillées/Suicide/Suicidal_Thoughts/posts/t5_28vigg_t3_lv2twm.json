Even after getting it, no one wanted to teach me how to drive. It took me shaving my head to get a lesson from my brother, and even then I've only ever been on the highway once. I'm 18. I know why they're doing this. I'm about to run away to college and I'm not letting them know where I'm going. My two older brothers are adults, 28 and 25 and they still haven't lived on their own they still live with my mom. They don't want me to surpass them and they want to keep me here as some servant or someone to succumb to their rage. I don't want to stay here, but tonight I was looking for a date for an appointment for my driver's test... The option wasn't even available. I think my permit has expired... I don't know if I can survive this I cannot live with them I wish I was dead", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lv2twm/i_dont_wanna_be_stuck_here/", "title": "I don't wanna be stuck here!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Dattebayo_Dattebayo", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614583187, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lv2twm/i_dont_wanna_be_stuck_here/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429008.6120515, "replies_charged": false}
