But I still want to die. Every time I do something, I suck at it and lose motivation. Even when I do persist, I feel like there\u2019s a barrier stopping me from being any better. I have nothing. My friends all hate me, I cry every night, everything annoys me, I get irrationally angry at tiny things. I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I am my own problem and that if I kill myself it\u2019ll all go away. But also I keep telling myself I don\u2019t have problems and I\u2019m making it all up. Because I don\u2019t have problems. Or at least not that I know of. I wake up every morning, skip breakfast because I slept in, go to school, skip lunch because I\u2019m not hungry, then continue school, come home, sit in silence and do nothing because if my mom catches me doing anything but homework she\u2019ll yell at me but I\u2019d rather sit in silence than do homework, then eat dinner, then go to bed and repeat. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, if anything. I let all my problems snowball up until I\u2019m forced to deal with them. I don\u2019t talk to people. I haven\u2019t not awkwardly started a conversation with anyone in god knows how long. All my friends tell me that if I die people will be sad, but I don\u2019t believe them. All of this, but I don\u2019t have any mental problems.
