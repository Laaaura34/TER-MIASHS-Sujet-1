I don\u2019t want to injure anyone else, I want it to be relatively quick, and look like an accident so my family wouldn\u2019t know I purposefully ended my life. So far I\u2019ve been too scared to actually go through with it which is a good thing. But I think about it a lot more, especially when my relationships with my family/friends are under duress or I\u2019m stressed at work. \n\nI\u2019ve been to therapists, I\u2019ve been on antidepressants. Diet changes, adequate exercise, job changes; you name it, I\u2019ve tried it. The main thing that holds me back is the trauma it would bring my family and friends, especially my mother. I think it would wreck her. She\u2019s depressed, suicidal at times, and an alcoholic. My grandma\u2019s death almost killed her and I think mine would send her over the edge. And I just can\u2019t do that to her when her life is finally going well. \n\nI just can\u2019t shake this feeling. I\u2019ve obsessed over a deadly car accident for years. Things improve for a while and I forget about wanting to die, but the thoughts are always there in the background just waiting for my next failure. Therapy again? Another round of antidepressants that may make me sicker and more suicidal than I am now? \n\nThank you for listening to me vent. I hope this subreddit will be a positive experience not only for me, but for others, and I look forward to meeting some of you and hopefully we can all find a reason to stay one more day.\n\nTL;DR Basically I have suicidal thoughts about killing myself in a car accident and it\u2019s hard to tame sometimes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ez54y1/thought_about_how_id_do_it/", "title": "Thought about how I\u2019d do it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Lejuicyfruit", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1580883976, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ez54y1/thought_about_how_id_do_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429376.4253101, "replies_charged": false}
