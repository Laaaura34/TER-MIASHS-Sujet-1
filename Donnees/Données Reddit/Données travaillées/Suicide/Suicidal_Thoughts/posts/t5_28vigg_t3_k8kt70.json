I wanted many people to see my post so I tagged the first thing that came up when searching suicide. Like I said in that post I\u2019m looking for a painless suicide method preferably instant although I know that no method is painless or instant even if you feel an aspect of pain for even half a second. As I\u2019m underaged I can\u2019t get a gun or pretend to work somewhere allowing me into a roof and I\u2019m insecure about someone trying to save me or not dying from the fall. I live in Peoria/Peoria heights in Illinois USA. Please no little helpful tips like \u201clife gets better just stick to it\u201d I need answers not comforting.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/k8kt70/please_read_repost_suicide/", "title": "Please read, repost (suicide)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "minxwastaken", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607361485, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/k8kt70/please_read_repost_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429623.1189466, "replies_charged": false}
