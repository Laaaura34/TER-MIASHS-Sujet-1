He said he forgave me but he never did and after years of what we did to each other, he has decided to gave up on me and I understand. \nI\u2019ve never loved anyone the way I love him and I never saw myself fantasizing with a life beyond my 30\u2019s with someone else (I\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts since I was 10 because I\u2019ve always felt guilty about everything, thx Catholic Church).\nAnd a few months ago I started noticing me more an more miserable, I couldn\u2019t stop crying then isolated from all my friends and hid everything from my family too. This year I lost my job and I can\u2019t get to finish my degree even tho I\u2019m in the last step since the last year. \nAnyways, today I found myself (again) searching online for ways to kill me and started fantasizing with the only letter I\u2019d leave in order to let them know that it wasn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s fault but my own to stop suffering, because I love living in concept, I just can\u2019t with the pain I feel because I\u2019ve developed chronic conditions due to how depressed I am. Everyday my body tells me that I can\u2019t hold it anymore, no matter the professional help I get (I\u2019ve been seeing a psychologist for over a year) nor the awesome and incredible support group I have (my beautiful family and two friends, besides my bf). \nI swear I wanna live, but I can\u2019t be functional anymore and don\u2019t know what else to do. The fact that I\u2019d hurt the people that I love the most has stopped me from trying to k*ll myself but not from fantasying more and more about how it\u2019d be better for me and everyone around me if I wasn\u2019t here anymore because I\u2019m not living and giving my all to my loved ones.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p19df7/some_days_i_feel_like_i_cant_anymore/", "title": "Some days I feel like I can\u2019t anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PastelEmoFairy", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628539683, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p19df7/some_days_i_feel_like_i_cant_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429439.6204605, "replies_charged": false}
