But I can never forget, I can be having fun and talking with people one second and the next I just want the release from all of it. I've tried before, took a gun and pulled the trigger, it didn't go off, so I figured I'm still needed here. But I don't want to be needed anymore. I don't want to be here anymore. I know that there are people who care about me and wouldn't ever get over it, but what about what I want. I want to stop hurting. I want to stop feeling like I owe everyone my time and happiness. I want to experience peace for a change. I want my head to be quiet just for awhile. I honestly don't know what the trigger will be but, I do know the day will come when I take my life, and my only regrets will be that I failed as a father and a lover. Please don't waste pity on me for I am comfortable with this. I just needed to say how I feel to faceless people because saying to someone I care about would only hurt them. I love all of you and I'm sorry that any of us feel like this, I hope you can find the strength to keep fighting, and attain the wisdom to over come these dark thoughts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/gh5l6d/how_did_i_get_here/", "title": "How did I get here", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JorgenVonDangle", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1589131680, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/gh5l6d/how_did_i_get_here/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428902.2050278, "replies_charged": false}
