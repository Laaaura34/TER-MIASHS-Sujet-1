Everyone has to do something, accept it\". Exactly! And thats why I'm depressed and suicidal, self harm and hate going outside my house:)\n\nIf I had the guts to I'd be dead long ago, but I dont. I know that I'm an entitled waste of space but did I ask to be here? No! And I can go if you wanted, I'd love to actually!!
