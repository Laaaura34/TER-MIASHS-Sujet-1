In my last year of high school (about a year ago) I suffered an accident in my judo training, my left leg got dislocated and after almost half a year of bad treatment the doctors got to the conclusion that they had to put me a hip prosthesis because my bone was not working anymore so yeah... the only thing that kept me kinda happy or at least motivated to do other things it\u2019s now gone because I can\u2019t even jump or even run without being in risk of hurting myself.\nAfter the accident, my teachers at school didn\u2019t care about my situation and I failed my assignments; because the pain I couldn\u2019t hang out with my friends and then the pandemic got to this side of the world and made the whole thing of getting emocional support by friends to deal with my new disability got more difficult and I don\u2019t have the kindest family to get the emocional support that any person in a similar situation could need.\nSo here I am asking about the fear of committing suicide because I feel useless. I don\u2019t have a life anymore. I\u2019m just in a perpetual state of recovery but just when I think that everything is getting better, the pain comes back and I can\u2019t get off my bed because of the massive pain\nMy parents and sister have to spend so much money on painkillers and have to help me to get up to go to the bathroom or anything else and they seem so exhausted because of me and believe me, I tried to do all of these things by myself but I just can\u2019t. I feel so useless that I think it would be so much better to everyone if I don\u2019t be here anymore but the thing is that I\u2019m scared of doing it. The fear of not knowing what\u2019s after death keeps me from doing it\nSorry if this is a stupid question but I really don\u2019t what to do to make all this suffering end\nAnd sorry if my english is bad but it\u2019s the best I can do\nThanks if you read until here", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/khabm0/how_do_you_loose_the_fear_to_commit_suicide/", "title": "How do you loose the fear to commit suicide?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JugularEmperor", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608526016, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/khabm0/how_do_you_loose_the_fear_to_commit_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429521.5144472, "replies_charged": false}
