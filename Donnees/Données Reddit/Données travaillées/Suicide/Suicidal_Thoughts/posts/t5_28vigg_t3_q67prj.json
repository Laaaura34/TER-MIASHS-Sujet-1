I think at the very least I'll write my note today, and then see where it takes me. There is without a doubt a part of me that wants to be strong enough to push through this anguish but I don't think I have it in me. I'm over the anxiety, I'm over the feeling numb, im over waking up in the middle of the night and wanting  slice my arm all the way down. I'm also allergic to peanuts so that would be an easy way for me. I live alone so no one would know till it's had it's toll on me. \nI just give up, every part of me internally is screaming and I just want it to end. Here's to hoping after writting the letter it will dicapate. But I also feel certain that my time is nearing. Thanks for letting me get that off my chest and best of luck to every one", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q67prj/it_feels_like_its_my_time/", "title": "It feels like it's my time", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "user2929209", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633991861, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q67prj/it_feels_like_its_my_time/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429213.4673545, "replies_charged": false}
