I am a 450lbs man living in a small studio apartment with my girlfriend, 2 bunnies, three mice, and soon a puppy, that all deserve better than me. I suffer from ADHD, PTSD, and given my eating habits, most likely some form of eating disorder. Over the past year, I have found myself hating mirrors and pictures. I can even stand to see myself naked, unless have have to. More and more often I think of just taking a photography trip into the mountains and having an \"accident\". My girlfriend would miss me, my siblings, and maybe my grandparents, but I've long been a disappointment to my parents and while they might miss me, that isn't enough to make me want to stay. I desperately need mental help, but I can't afford it, and I can't afford to miss work or I would check myself into a mental hospital. I'm running out of options fast, and while I don't want to die, I can't find any other way to make the pain stop. To make the constant voice in the back of my head telling me that I'm not enough and never will be or the constant thoughts that things will never get better, just go away or end. I've asked for advice, I've looked into treatment...I don't know what to do anymore...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pt242u/i_dont_know_anymore/", "title": "I don't know anymore.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dapandaboi266", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632294492, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pt242u/i_dont_know_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429432.4453783, "replies_charged": false}
