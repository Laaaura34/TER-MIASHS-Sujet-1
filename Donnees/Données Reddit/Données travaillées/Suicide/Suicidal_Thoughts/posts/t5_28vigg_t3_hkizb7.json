I\u2019m 23 years old, a military wife, I have 2 kids. An almost 3 year old and a 1 year old. I am literally thousands of miles away from my family and my best friend. I\u2019ve lived in Virginia for 3 years and I\u2019ve made no friends. I\u2019m suicidal. Can\u2019t go a day without wanting to die. The one time I called a suicide hotline the operator told me \u201cis this an emergency? I have someone on the other line and I can\u2019t talk to you unless it\u2019s an emergency\u201d and I just hung up. My body and soul feel empty. My mom was never very good at being a mom, but it was okay because I had my aunt and my mother in law. But my mother in law died of brain cancer in January 2019, having only been diagnosed 5 months prior. And my aunts son (my cousin) raped and molested me as a kid and when I told her she just.... kinda pretended that it didn\u2019t happen. My husband and I used to be really close but he works all the time and when he comes home he drink a whole bottle of whatever good alcohol was on sale and goes to sleep. His mom just died last year and I know he\u2019s sad too. He\u2019s almost never home, he barely gets to see his kids grow up. I really feel for him. But he lives in his own world where nothing really matters except getting to the next day. And I can\u2019t really blame him because I relate. But we don\u2019t have sex anymore. We barely talk to each other. I\u2019ve mentioned I\u2019m suicidal and he says things like \u201cit\u2019ll be okay\u201d without looking up from his phone across the room. I\u2019ve tried begging for his attention in the past but it really gets me nowhere so I don\u2019t try much anymore. All I want is to feel any kind of lust for life. I\u2019ve always struggled with depression but I would have happy days on occasion. I don\u2019t remember the last time I had a happy day. I feel awful for my kids, I promised I would be a present mother for my kids, I promised I\u2019d do the opposite of what my mom did but all I want to do is lay in bed and cry. I\u2019ve stopped eating. I gained 50 pounds since having kids and I\u2019ve always had body dysmorphia and even when I was 120 lbs (I\u2019m 5\u20197) I thought I was a giant fatass. Now that I\u2019m 170 (or more? I don\u2019t step on the scale anymore lmao) I\u2019ve decided to just stop eating because maybeeee it\u2019ll help me hate my life less? If I\u2019m not so fucking fat? I know that\u2019s not how it works but it\u2019s hard to get rid of an eating disorder mindset. I don\u2019t have these standards for anyone else, just me. I don\u2019t think about cheating on my husband or anything... I don\u2019t want to destroy his life or my kids lives. I just want mine to end. Honestly the only reason we haven\u2019t divorced is because I don\u2019t have the money to move me and my two kids across the country. I wish I could put into words to someone that I need help but I\u2019m just convinced no one wants to hear it.\nWe have guns in the house. I hold mine against my head sometimes but I\u2019ve never pulled the trigger (obviously).
