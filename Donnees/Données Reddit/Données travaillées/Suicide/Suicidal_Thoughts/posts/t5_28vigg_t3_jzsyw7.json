Its literally midnight and I have to study for a test tomorrow. But the only thing I can think of is suicide and self harm. Nothing else. I literally try to not think about it and focus on my studies but I fail every time. I can't tell this to anyone so I'm in this mess alone. I have no friends to talk about my problems to and the only reason why I'm still here is my family, cause I don't want to hurt them. I'm so tired and can't even focus. Nothing helps. I constantly think about how I should kill myself and how I should harm myself. I don't know what to do at this point.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jzsyw7/im_tired_of_this/", "title": "I'm tired of this", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "confusedhumanbeing12", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606173257, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jzsyw7/im_tired_of_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429153.669297, "replies_charged": false}
