When I'm sad, they say it makes them sad that I am sad. They say don't express your sadness. Look at your cousins who are going through shit in life but still going on. You have a good life, be grateful. Im trying, mom. \n\nMy dad said I'm not a good kid when I'm exhausted and couldn't get out of my bed.\n\nI reach out to my friends, I tell them I wanna die, they think I'm joking. \n\nI know I'm a disappointment to everyone in my life. Im a disgrace. Im unreliable. Im incompetent. And now this chronic conditions. \n\nBut is it hard to take me seriously? I just want to kill myself to prove them wrong. To show them what's going on inside my head. So they'll know I needed them and they weren't there. \n\nIt's been three years and I'm suffering alone. I wanna put an end to this agony.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p4yenm/i_wish_people_take_me_seriously/", "title": "I wish people take me seriously", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sakthi38311", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629050525, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p4yenm/i_wish_people_take_me_seriously/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428975.0028105, "replies_charged": false}
