No matter what I do, I can't stop thinking about this.\nI'm alone, no one would miss me. I'm the last alive member of my family, I have no friends and I hate my job.\nThese helplines can't help me, nobody can. All my thoughts are turning about my trauma, my suicide attempts and how to do better.\nNobody would care, after all. I feel like it's useless to wait. Wait for what? Nothing's going to change anyway.\nAll I do is just setting my death day to another day. Everybody dies some day and I don't understand why people make such a fuss of it, or of self harm. It's just my body. My life. My choice. I am worthless anyways. I have no feelings left inside, just emptiness and sadness.\nI can look at the horriblest things, dead people, lose close people, watch them die and I don't feel anything, I don't even care. I don't know why. \nWho would care if someone like me just...went. All I have is two people online I talk to. They would just think I moved on if I don't talk anymore. Nobody would care because all my life I kept people away from me, because I don't want anyone to miss me when I'm gone. I've got everything done. Helplines didn't help.\n\nAnyone. Just give me one reason why not.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/le83zi/i_want_it_to_end/", "title": "I want it to end", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "_DoABarrelRoll_", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612649309, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/le83zi/i_want_it_to_end/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429030.4106832, "replies_charged": false}
