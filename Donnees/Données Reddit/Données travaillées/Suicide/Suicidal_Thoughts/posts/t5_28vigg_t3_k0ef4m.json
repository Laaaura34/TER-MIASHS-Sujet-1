It was going smooth for the first month. It got really overwhelming and that's what triggered these thoughts.\nI'm disfuncional, I hate studying. I don't know how to do it. I barely listen to any lectures and then I don't know what I have to do. We have a lot of group projects and I feel like I'm letting my group down. Deadlines are getting closer and I haven't done shit.\n\nI feel like I'm going to drop out. Personally, I wouldn't give a fuck but I'm so scared of the judgement and embarrassment since it's a pretty easy field of studies. And it would really dissapont my parents. They believe in me. I just feel like I'd rather kill myself than go through all of this. \n\nFuck my life.
