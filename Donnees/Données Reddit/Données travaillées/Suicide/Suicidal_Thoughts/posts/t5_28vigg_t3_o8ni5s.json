It\u2019s sad because i\u2019ve always been that long skinny boy with a big smile on his face. \nNow all i can feel is emptiness.\n\nI hope i\u2019ll read what i wrote many years later and i\u2019ll be happy because i was brave enough to not go, it\u2019s just a moment of our lives where we need to dream about a life much softer, believe me when i say that i was almost gone a few times and if i\u2019m alive tonight you can be alive tomorrow.\nAs lonely as i am i think about you every night before i close my eyes hoping you\u2019ll fall asleep without any harm, we will get through this \ud83d\udda4", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o8ni5s/why_is_loneliness_so_hard_to_live_with/", "title": "why is loneliness so hard to live with", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Defiant_Scar_1119", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624757591, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o8ni5s/why_is_loneliness_so_hard_to_live_with/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429291.2218823, "replies_charged": false}
