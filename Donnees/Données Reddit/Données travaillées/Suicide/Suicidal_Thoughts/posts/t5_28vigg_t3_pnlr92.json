I will never have anything i want, never be happy. All the things i wanted in life, i failed at, lost, never got, was too dumb or archive or had back luck. Ive been scammed out of a lot of money and now nothing i want to help make me happy is possible. Im breaking down because there is no hope left and i just once again fucked up and failed to archive a life long dream after trying so hard. And now im left trying to accept it but i cant because my life is just a long list of similar pain off loss and failure and i never feel happy. Its all just painfull and i want to just end it. I will never be happy and everything ive ever wanted to do in life.. ive failed at or been unable to get. Im tired of crying over this and feeling this pain daily.i cant handle this any longer.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pnlr92/im_tired_i_cant_live_anymore/", "title": "Im tired, i cant live anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Reality_confusion", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631559017, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pnlr92/im_tired_i_cant_live_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429103.98508, "replies_charged": false}
