In this past month i had a really bad time and some fucked up stuff happened like my gf leaving me and me not knowing where to go, i cant find anyone i trust, i dont wanna open up to anyone i just wanna be alone but at the same time when im alone im starting to have more and more suicidal thoughts and i just want to kill myself, what do i lose anyways? maybe death will bring peace and i can rest easy?...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/juc87k/having_suicidal_thoughts_recently/", "title": "Having suicidal thoughts recently.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Nice-Fall-7263", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605398805, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/juc87k/having_suicidal_thoughts_recently/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429420.5585113, "replies_charged": false}
