Coz that would have been a perfect night to do it, noone would have found me for 2 days. Most of today I was hungover and felt sick, then when I felt better I started to sort stuff out to get it done, it took so long that I'm actually worn out. Now my brother is gonna be back shortly so now I have to suffer again for another few days till he leaves.
