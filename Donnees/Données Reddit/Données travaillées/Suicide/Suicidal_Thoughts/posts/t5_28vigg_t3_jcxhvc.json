to know everything that you've been through\nBut if it's shame you feel, just know that I've sinned too\nAnd if it's pain you're feeling\nJust know that that's something I went through\nI don't know your story, but I know you and me are a lot alike\nSo let me talk to you for a minute while I've got this chance \n\nI was 18 when I pulled a gun out\nAt the time it felt like my options had run out\nSo I put that barrel to my chest, and I pulled the trigger halfway\nI tried to muster up the courage to put myself away that day\nBut halfway with that trigger pulled, I stopped\nTears flooded my eyes and that pistol dropped\nAnd I sat in my room and I sobbed for an hour\nOn the outside I was fine, on the inside a coward\n\nThe noise of my depression had gotten louder and louder\nI had planned a way out on a baptism shower of gunpowder\nI've been lied to just like you're being lied to now\nOther people can't help you, but I might know how\nBecause I've walked in your shoes and I've been at my lowest\nAnd if you don't know anything, know this\n\nYou might tell me you're gonna kill yourself and you're close to this\nBut God wants to meet you in the middle of your hopelessness\nGod wants to give you a way out of these feelings of doubt\nAnd the sounds of chaos might be reverberating around you like heavy metal\nBut confusion isn't from God, it's straight from the devil\nAnd he wants to silence the noise and bring peace to you\nAnd I promise if you just ask him, he'll see you through\nYou got to this place because you tried fighting your own fight\nAnd where did that get you except contemplating about taking your own life?\n\nAnd if you got bullied to this point\nI'm sorry you went through that\nBut God wants to take those words\nFrom your attackers and send them back\nYou don't have to be defined by what people said about you\nLet me pick you up if you don't know how to\n\nYou're not alone, man, you've got a friend in me\nYou got better days ahead of you, I just pray you begin to see\nKnow that everything the devil did to you, he wants you to replay\nBut everything the devil took from you, God wants to replace\nListen to me right now, you better look me right in the face\nYou were created for more than to die in this place\n\nDon't do it man, please, don't take your life\nJust take my hand we'll make this right\nI promise if you do this you'll regret it\nYou wake up in eternity remember, I said it\nAnd you wished so bad you could just go back\nI'm here for you right now, please, just know that\nAnd if you think you're alone in this fight, you've been lied to\nThat depression came after me and I nearly died too\n\nI thought suicide was the only way and death was meant for me\nThe devil played his music and I sat front row through that symphony\nI walked through the fire and I felt that heat\nBut I pushed past the clutter and I stood to my feet\nI walked out and I refuse to look back\nI took my depression and threw it right back, into that wood stack\nAnd that fire must have blazed 50 feet high\nAnd now I plan on leaving a legacy to look back on some day when I die\n\nAnd right now I'm telling you to stand up too\nDeep down inside, you know it's the right thing to do\nThink about your family, think about you\nDon't kill yourself, please, don't do it\nWhatever you're facing God will see you through it\n\nI had a fan kill himself and his mom asked if I could come see her\nShe was depressed and asked if I could meet her\nTwo weeks later depression beat her\nShe ran into a telephone pole without a seat belt in a two seater\n\nAnd I wish right now I could crawl through these speakers\nAnd somehow convince you not to go the same route she did\nI wish I could change the fact that you feel defeated\nI wish I could lock my arms around you and tell the devil to beat it\nBut I can't reach everyone even though I do my best to try\n\nSome people believe the lie that it's just best to die\nAnd they think it's the simple way out\nBut they're not here to see the way things play out\nThey don't see the hurt they caused, the pain they leave\nI take this seriously, this isn't a game to me\nEven thinking about ending your life is living dangerously\nSo please, just listen to my voice, right now you have a choice\nYou can choose life or you can get drowned by the noise\n\nPlease, don't do it, please, just ask for help\nIf not for your family, do it for yourself", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jcxhvc/sometimes_i_just_wish/", "title": "Sometimes I just wish..",
