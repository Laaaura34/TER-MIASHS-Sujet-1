I want to die the feeling didnt leave when I got out the hospital it just subsided for awhile then came back and just fucking crashed hard on me. I don\u2019t even want to try to live anymore I just need a plan and note and I think I will be good, so if I am dead in the near future and someone reads this, it is not your fault, I can\u2019t open up to anyone so in reality it is my fault and will continue to be my fault until I decide to take my own life", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/l118lx/damn_that_did_not_last_long_at_all/", "title": "Damn that did not last long at all", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Puzzleheaded-Sand956", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611115367, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/l118lx/damn_that_did_not_last_long_at_all/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429027.4449883, "replies_charged": false}
