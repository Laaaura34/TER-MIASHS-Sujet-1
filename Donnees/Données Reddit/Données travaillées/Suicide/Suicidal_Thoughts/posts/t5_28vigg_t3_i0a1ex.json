I always wondering what will people think if I commit suicide, I'm 25 y.o guy with a small business that going downhill without debt, but I spend all of my savings to start my business & it's hard for me to just make a living day by day at this time. I never ask for help 'cause I think it will burden other people especially my parents that never support me since I was 12. I want to end all of this pain I've felt since that day, is this thought were really selfish? To commit something that will separate me from persons I care about, even when they don't really care about me?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/i0a1ex/is_this_kind_of_thought_really_selfish/", "title": "Is this kind of thought really selfish?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MyStupidi66", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596061133, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/i0a1ex/is_this_kind_of_thought_really_selfish/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429580.7208369, "replies_charged": false}
