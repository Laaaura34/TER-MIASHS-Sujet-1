Currently thinking either hang my self so mom finds me and feels like shit for revenge of childhood abuse or much more likely success of suicide go to the train tracks near by and wait for freight train to pass and lay head on tracks. Last month for about 2 weeks I have been able to do a few things that made me feel better. I've worked out everyday with off days basically just doing some ab work and jump rope everyday and lift weights 3 days a week. Also I've been able to do deep breathing exercises for those 2 weeks and stretch everyday drunk so far half a gallon of water a day was slowly improving. Cleaned my place daily kept it organized and have eaten only homemade food. Everything was going well was planning on having a job by the end of June then my stupid fucking relatives who are too willfully ignorant to follow distancing guidelines got everyone in my apartment building sick. And am currently too weak to workout which was my carrot now I have to wait this out. Just came here to gripe since I have no one to gripe to.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/gwr5rv/covid_blues/", "title": "Covid blues", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwabulletmyway", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1591307617, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/gwr5rv/covid_blues/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429375.0554411, "replies_charged": false}
