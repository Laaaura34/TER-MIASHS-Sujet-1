I fantasise so much about dying. I also know it\u2019s fucked up but I find myself fantasising about shit after I\u2019m dead, like people crying at my funeral. I know it\u2019s messed up but the thoughts of me finally dying help me fall asleep at night, to which I hope I don\u2019t wake up. I go to sleep every night and hope it\u2019s the last time, and yet I keep waking up and have to live another day. I\u2019m so scared to attempt to kill myself, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s from the part of me that wants to stay or because I\u2019m scared of failing again, but I\u2019m thinking I need to find a way of gradually killing myself instead. I\u2019ve attempted by overdose a couple times, but I was thinking that if I take over the max amount of tablets (paracetamol/ibuprofen/cold and flu) everyday then it surely would gradually kill me at some point. Then people would think it\u2019s an accident due to taking too many tablets bc I was ill or something. I don\u2019t know.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n0689y/the_thoughts_are_back/", "title": "The thoughts are back", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sunflowercherryvol6", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619581728, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n0689y/the_thoughts_are_back/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429003.272432, "replies_charged": false}
