Just wanted to know if someone is falling appart because of the same reasons I am. I'm young and lately I've been discovering how the world actually works and so far...it sucks. I mean, as humans we cause so much pain to each other, we are so mean and we don't care at all about anything else rather than money. Money is avobe life. Y just realiced that all the ugly and bad thing in the world come from humans and it makes me really sad. I don't understand the point of anything, every single thing in my life and in our society in general seems trully stupid to me. The badness we spread have been making me wanna die so hard. I know I just can't of course beacause it would be a problem for people around me and I don't know how to manage my existance.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n77xd8/were_bad/", "title": "We're bad...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Confident-Channel-27", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620418749, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n77xd8/were_bad/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429277.205155, "replies_charged": false}
