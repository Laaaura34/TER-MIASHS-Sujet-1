But I can\u2019t get myself to hurt the people who love me. I feel like the only thing that\u2019s been helping me feel just a little bit better is self-harming. It\u2019s the only thing that gets me out of my mind. It just takes all that emotional pain away. I\u2019ve tried to reach out for help so many times in so many ways. I told my mom how I feel and what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ve told a select few friends what\u2019s going on. I have two counselors. I\u2019ve tried reaching out to self-harm hotlines. I\u2019ve called the hospitals behavioral health hotline. I\u2019ve called the suicide hotline. I\u2019ve tried everything, but nothing seems to help. Soon I\u2019m going to lose the strength that\u2019s kept me going. I\u2019m eventually going to get tired of trying. I don\u2019t know when it\u2019ll be, but I feel like it\u2019s going to be soon. I don\u2019t know what to do.
