It was always hard making friends or even leaving my house. I was bullied countless times and it resulted in me fighting which triggered my anger more. I was suspended throughout three different schools during my childhood. Each time, my parents and I moved i cause trouble again. It wasent until high school where I finally saw a doctor and short enough, he told me that I had severe depression and anxiety- offered me some \u201chappy pills\u201d I told him to fuck off and didn\u2019t take them. I graduated high school (barley), parents were proud of me. But, as immigrant parents usually are, they pressured me to go into college and study stuff I really didn\u2019t want to. So I did, dropped out multiple times. Now here I am, writing this post on Reddit, don\u2019t know why but I\u2019m still feeling the same way. I\u2019ve written my note over and over again but could never fully commit to ending it. I even wrote a separate note to my parents which I keep hidden. I can\u2019t find motivation anymore, I\u2019m stuck with no job just collecting money from whatever the government gives me. I go to to the gym, sometimes. It boost me up, but at 23 I got nothing to live for, can\u2019t find the motivation, and honestly feel like I\u2019ll leave nothing behind if I did die. I know my parents would be sad but as time goes on so will life and they\u2019ll get over it as much as many other so called friends I had will to. Anyways, that\u2019s my story.
