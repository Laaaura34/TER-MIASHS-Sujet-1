I tried to stay because i hoped that things will eventually get better but they didn't. Had i just ended my life years ago then i wouldn't have to experience all those shit. Fml. Whenever I go out, I secretly wish that I'll just be hit by a car, shot by someone, or die from the virus ( but i dont want to spread it to my family). It would have been easier to die in an accident than commit suicide. No further dramas and all that shit. Some people might be sad but theyll eventually move on. Afterall some of them treated me like shit so im not really sure if theyll feel sorry for me ( not that i want them to). I just dont know whats the use of continuing this life. I wish that i can just unexist so that i dont have to die.
