I do not want to be one of those people who brags about depression or other mental illnesses, so I keep it all inside. I have had suicidal thoughts yet am not confident enough to tell anyone. To those around me it would seem as if I have a wholesome life, a girlfriend, great grades, and a somewhat attractive persona; on the inside, when I am alone, I just can\u2019t bear my existence. I do not want a therapist because then someone will know, know that I am struggling, know that i\u2019m not half decent. I cry in my bed at night, listen to incoherent music at full volume in my headphones. When I\u2019m alone I tell myself that I am worthless, that I have no positive attributes, that I will make anything of myself. I genuinely can\u2019t separate my feelings that are real and those that are not. This is the first time i\u2019ve ever attempted putting my feelings out in the public, I\u2019m sure I could write much more.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jgaoav/i_cant_tell_anyone/", "title": "I can\u2019t tell anyone", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TurboSleeze", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603407375, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jgaoav/i_cant_tell_anyone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429633.3070557, "replies_charged": false}
