My body is more or less a skeleton with gray flames. \nNo more options visible to me. It isn't like I lack anything, I've got caring and loving parents, some good and few friends, and a loving girlfriend but what I see is myself burning away.\nThe original me was a body which set itself on fire unknowingly, burning myself away layer by layer, the flame which was blue, became grey.\nSoon this gray flame will die down and I'll become a husk. Finally, my body, which once had a human soul residing will become just like a branch of a tree devoid of any life force, zapped off its soul.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q41vm0/husk/", "title": "Husk.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DepressedSamurai", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633712354, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q41vm0/husk/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428917.6572266, "replies_charged": false}
