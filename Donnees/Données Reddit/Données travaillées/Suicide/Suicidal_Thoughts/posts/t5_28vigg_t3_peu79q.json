Work training at my new job was a little better, but I feel completely drained. I don\u2019t even feel like a real person. I don\u2019t have any friends at my school. I watch people just going around and functioning and feel like something is very wrong with me. I\u2019m not sure why everything is a chore, a fight, a struggle. Especially when someone days are perfectly fine and even great! I can\u2019t imagine doing this up and down shit for a whole school year. I already took a year off in 2019. Inpatient isn\u2019t an option again. I just think so little of myself that I don\u2019t see a reason to keep living. I don\u2019t feel actively suicidal right now (no plan, no methods), but I don\u2019t feel like living either.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/peu79q/why_continue_on_when_even_the_smallest_tasks_take/", "title": "Why continue on when even the smallest tasks take so much out of me?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "miscellaneousbean", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630367336, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/peu79q/why_continue_on_when_even_the_smallest_tasks_take/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429216.4715984, "replies_charged": false}
