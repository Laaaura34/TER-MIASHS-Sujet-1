If someone wanna die then  they should be able to do so, suicide really ain't that depressing. I don't even wanna get into my fucked up ideologies, ANYWAY TO THE POINT.\n\nWhat are painless, cheap and convinient ways to go besides a gun?\nI don't live in America so we don't have guns in every cornerstore I see lmao \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80, so I need an alternative. \n\nExit bags / Suicide bags with helium seemed like a good option, but some people say It's like dying in your sleep, some say It's panicky asf, (well noshit). Anyway is it true that there is no feeling of choking when u use helium? Helium is very easy to acquire. Pills are too risky. Could be painless, could be 12hours of relentless suffering, I ain't doing that. Any other ways? Also could add soms tilps & tricks cus I don't want none of that 'attempts' bullshit, when I do it I will be gone and that's the end of it.\n\nAnyways thanks,\nBest regarda,\nYa boi sam", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qf1btc/painless_and_cheap_ways_to_go_besides_a_gun/", "title": "Painless and cheap ways to go besides a gun?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Lufesnes", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635109877, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qf1btc/painless_and_cheap_ways_to_go_besides_a_gun/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428832.1741765, "replies_charged": false}
