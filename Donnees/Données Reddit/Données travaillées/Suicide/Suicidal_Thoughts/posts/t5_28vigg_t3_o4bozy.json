Trust me I\u2019ve tried talking to therapists and going to anti-suicidal thought groups but that has had no change whatsoever so I guess this really is my last hope. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not looking for those fake response like \u201cYour family will miss you\u201d because that\u2019s bullshit. They\u2019ll miss me for a week or two and then forget about me. So what I\u2019m tryna say here is that need someone to convince me that I will not regret it at the last moment because the last thing I want is to have a failed suicide attempt because I pussied out and thus landing me in a wheelchair with a 24hrs nurse supervising my every move. So all I really want is someone to give me a valid reason either to do it and get it over with or just get the fuck on with my life.\n\n\\- F", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o4bozy/i_just_need_reasons/", "title": "I just need reasons", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway_skr", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624213348, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o4bozy/i_just_need_reasons/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429616.4605784, "replies_charged": false}
