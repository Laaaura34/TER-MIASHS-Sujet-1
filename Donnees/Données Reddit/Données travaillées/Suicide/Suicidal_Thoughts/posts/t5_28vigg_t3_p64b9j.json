Even before, my pregnancy was brutal mentally and I have never experienced such a painful void until that point. I have been battling with suicidal thoughts and borderline actions for awhile, and the only thing that stops me is the thought of my partner having to raise our son by himself. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to step into the dad role let alone the mom role if i left. I feel trapped. On top of that, my partner is a psychotic narcissist that does not know how to express their emotions and communicate. It\u2019s always anger and frustration over anything. So, naturally, that has an influence on making my emotional and mental state worse. I opened up to him about a month ago that I wanted to leave this planet every day, and that I\u2019m saying something now because I\u2019m scared that I actually might. He expressed his concern and wanted me to get help. But no actions after that showed me that anything I said actually got through to him. So a few days ago, I had a breakdown and was just short of offing myself, and this man just hugs me and goes upstairs to call his friend about football not even a minute later, and then leaves. He left me alone in the house minutes after my breakdown, as my eyes were still swelled, with our son in the bathtub. I\u2019m not sure what to do at this point. It seems pretty obvious to leave but I feel trapped because he\u2019s the father of my child and now I have to deal with him forever.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p64b9j/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/", "title": "I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "No_oneforeternity", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629208676, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p64b9j/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429308.4363258, "replies_charged": false}
