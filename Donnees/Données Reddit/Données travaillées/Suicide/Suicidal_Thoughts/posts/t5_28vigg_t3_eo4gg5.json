But I think about killing myself all the time. It's like a voice in the back of my head constantly telling me it'd be easier to just kill myself. But I don't actually want to. I just feel like I'm a therapist for everybody I know. Everybody rants to me and I listen to their hurt and heartache, and I always give advice. I always listen and I always care. I stay up until 3am because I care about all my friends. But none of them are ever there for me. It doesn't matter what time of day it is or what they're doing, none of them listen or care about how I'm feeling. It feels like I'm being used by most of the people in my life. \nYet, when I tell them that nobody cares, they get offended and say they do. They say they care, but they never show it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/eo4gg5/im_not_going_to_kill_myself_but_i_have_suicidal/", "title": "I'm not going to kill myself, but I have suicidal thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pea_leaf", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1578923959, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/eo4gg5/im_not_going_to_kill_myself_but_i_have_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428959.9605405, "replies_charged": false}
