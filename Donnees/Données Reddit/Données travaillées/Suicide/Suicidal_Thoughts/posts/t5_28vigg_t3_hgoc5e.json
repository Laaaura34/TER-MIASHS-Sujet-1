I have to live in conditions like dump.\nMy reasons might be selfish all I wanted was to be treated equally and get the same love, I never did anything wrong, I have good grades, good attendance and i do all my assignments on time, never did alcohol or drugs always been obedient but I still get treated like shit and get the shortest end of the stick.
