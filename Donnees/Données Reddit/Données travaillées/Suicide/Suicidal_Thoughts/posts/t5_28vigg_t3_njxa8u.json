It's just nice to know I have options. Very, very nice. \n\nLately I've been more depressed that usual and when it rains, it pours. More and more things are happening around me in succession that, compounded, are slowly making me feel like I'm suffocating.\n\nLike always, I sat down and played with the idea of suicide, then it occurred to me that I don't really have a method I'd ever be willing to use. Now I'm having panic attacks because my option is no longer there.\n\nI don't want to die painfully, and I don't want it to look like I meant to kill myself.\n\nSo for the sake calming my anxiety, does anyone know of a easy way with items/chemicals/drugs that are hanging around the house that don't make it seem like an overt attempt?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/njxa8u/painless_easily_accessed_household_items_i_can/", "title": "Painless, easily accessed household items I can use to cause an \"accidental\" death?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Top_Challenge_3515", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621860820, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/njxa8u/painless_easily_accessed_household_items_i_can/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429222.4157727, "replies_charged": false}
