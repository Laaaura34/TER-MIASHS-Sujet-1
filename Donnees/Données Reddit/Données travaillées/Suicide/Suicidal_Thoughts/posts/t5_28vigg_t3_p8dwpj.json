I don\u2019t want to die for the sake of my parents and grandparents being heartbroken. but I don\u2019t wanna be alive anymore. I do not want any responsibilities. I don\u2019t want any thoughts. I wish I didn\u2019t exist and I often think of killing my self, although I never act on it. Is it still serious if you seriously consider and want it but don\u2019t  ever actually partake in the act of doing it?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p8dwpj/how_do_you_know_when_suicidal_thoughts_are_serious/", "title": "How do you know when suicidal thoughts are serious?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ang0025", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629493318, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p8dwpj/how_do_you_know_when_suicidal_thoughts_are_serious/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428722.0077586, "replies_charged": false}
