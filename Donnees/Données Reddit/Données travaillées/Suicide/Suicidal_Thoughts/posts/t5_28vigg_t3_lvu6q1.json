I am too scared of death and also I\u2019ve felt this way before (just not as strongly) and eventually things did get a little better so I\u2019m hoping that will happen again. About 5 months ago me and my girlfriend of 3 years broke up, we were off and on so I always expected her to come back ya know? She didn\u2019t this time. So now she\u2019s with a new guy and I saw her Snapchat story with him in it, she\u2019s staying at his house it seems and just I don\u2019t know it hurts man. I took her off Snapchat so I can\u2019t see the stories anymore (I don\u2019t really use it I just decided to log in that day) seeing her with him it just sent me back to day 1 of losing her. It kills me to think of her with some other guy, loving someone else. At the same time I want her to be happy and I feel selfish, I suffer from depression and drug abuse and she didn\u2019t use drugs at all so honestly I felt like she\u2019s better off with a more stable guy. Honestly I think this was the best thing for her so I feel so fucking selfish man but I can\u2019t help but miss her so much.... I don\u2019t know how to get over this, I am an artist but I can\u2019t even draw without thinking about her cuz I was teaching her art... the one thing I loved to do that took my mind off pain in life now makes me think of her and hurts me. I don\u2019t know what to do man. Sorry for writing so much guys.
