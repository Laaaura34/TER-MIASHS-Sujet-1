Last time I talked about me wanting to commit suicide but this time I want to talk about my depression.\n\nA few years ago I started having symptoms of depression. The school started to give much more homework and my parents started to demand more higher grades (I live in Asia, typical Asian parent stereotype) so I started having pressure and symptoms of depression.\nI started playing games on my iPad. As time went on, I started to get more and more pressure and my time of playing got more and more.\nOne day (the day when I posted that post) I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. So I opened the window (I live in a tall apartment building) and I wanted to jump off the building, Luckily(or unluckily), my mum found me and caught my shirt before I could jump off.\nHowever, this resulted in something bad.\nFrom now on, my parents would hide my iPad and use \u201cyou will jump off the building if you play\u201d as a excuse to not make me play. As the iPad was my only way of escaping reality, to ease pressure, I now find myself wanting to commit suicide every day, as I am writing this right now, I find myself wanting to jump off the building again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ln95md/i_have_depression_and_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "I have depression and suicidal thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TJJS1109", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613716848, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ln95md/i_have_depression_and_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428829.9786384, "replies_charged": false}
