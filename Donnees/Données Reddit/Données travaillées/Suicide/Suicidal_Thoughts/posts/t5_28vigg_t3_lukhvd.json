I used to think about suicide, one or two days a week. But now, it's everyday. I might really do it this time.\n\nI have always been fascinated by death.\n\nWhat difference does it make, if I die today or 20 years from now? What difference does it make if I die now or after achieving something world breaking? \nThe answer is Nothing.\n\nAll life is a misery. The whole universe was an accident, a mistake. Death, darkness is the only reality. It is time, I accept this and move to the eternal darkness.\n\nWish me all the luck, hopefully this will be my last post here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lukhvd/i_got_upgraded_to_suicidal/", "title": "I got upgraded to Suicidal+", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "6174_kah", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614531123, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lukhvd/i_got_upgraded_to_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429558.1904583, "replies_charged": false}
