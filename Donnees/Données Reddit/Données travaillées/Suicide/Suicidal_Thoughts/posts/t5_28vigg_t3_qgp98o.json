All I have to say is, I really want to walk in front of a car, or take more meds than I should (diagnosed with epilepsy. 4 years ago so that doesn't help..) I self harm. Been doing it for years.. idk if I'm actually depressed or just deeply sad and stressed. I feel like everyone I know just looks right through me, and not at me. You know? I'm scared.. I feel useless because I can't stop these negative thoughts.. Idk what to do.. I really don't want to go to a doctor. I've been hospitalized before and,, they just let me go after 3 days.. it's pointless... please help.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qgp98o/ive_been_feeling_depressed_and_have_been_getting/", "title": "Ive been feeling depressed and have been getting suicidal thoughts.. help please :(", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KermitBeeze135", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635311891, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qgp98o/ive_been_feeling_depressed_and_have_been_getting/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428708.6686742, "replies_charged": false}
