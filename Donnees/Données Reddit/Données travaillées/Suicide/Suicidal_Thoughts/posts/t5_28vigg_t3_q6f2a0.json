I was tossed out like trash for no reason and now I feel like trash. I was threatened with physical harm if I were to stay, packing my clothes, so I had to leave in a hurry with the literal clothes on my back. I had to leave behind all my personal belongings and even my 2 dogs. My brother and I shared a life together and split all household bills straight down the middle, but I still got thrown out like trash. For the pass 2 days I\u2019ve felt numb, feels like I\u2019m moving in molasses, and stuck in a mental fog with no joy in my life. Friday I contemplated killing my self because I can\u2019t stand feeling this way. I feel like the loser my bro said I am and I can\u2019t find anything worth living for and this feeling scares the shit out of me. I know there are so many people out there with worst issues than mine and it\u2019s hard for me to validate my emotions. I am tired of this constant tightness in my chest, the constant feeling of feeling like a loser and I can\u2019t find the strength to move forward. I\u2019m scared of what I might do to myself in order to feel something rather than nothing. I have no hope and feel this march of life is pointless. I\u2019m scared!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q6f2a0/dark_thoughts/", "title": "Dark thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bigtigloc", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634016620, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q6f2a0/dark_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429143.0096688, "replies_charged": false}
