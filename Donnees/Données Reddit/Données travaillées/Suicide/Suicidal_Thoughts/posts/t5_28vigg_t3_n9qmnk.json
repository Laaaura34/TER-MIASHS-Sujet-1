I am a functional alcoholic, I know its not the norm, if you are alcoholic that\u2019s a problem. But drinking until I\u2019m drunk each night has made me feel more secure and more loving of my flaws and myself. I wish there was a medication like this, one that didn\u2019t ruin my liver. But I also know it is wrong to seek refuge in drugs that can addict and ruin my wellbeing. I am getting therapy, but booze has helped me more than any prescription (all of the prescriptions i have tried so far have made me more suicidal, and i have been on 8 diff ones.) I guess i am just seeking a refuge and a new mode of thought. Alcohol has provided that, but I am so scared that it is a slippery slope. Any anecdotes or words of encouragement help. I feel bad unloading this, but I value anyones opinion.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n9qmnk/suicidal_but_alcohol_has_helped/", "title": "Suicidal, but alcohol has helped", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sox_is_sad", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620714810, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n9qmnk/suicidal_but_alcohol_has_helped/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429557.3475778, "replies_charged": false}
