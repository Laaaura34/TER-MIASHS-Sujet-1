And dont forget sleeping pills too.\n\nSadly, I tried it on summer noon, in tropical country, and without sleeping pills. It tortures and reminds me hell so much, feel like vomiting, fuzzy and dizzy.\n\nCurrently investing on a second attempt with helium. Hope it'll work.\n\nFriends, please stop trying to overdose from pills, mostly generic one. Success rate is slim, and it'll likely hurt you physically.\n\nCurrently looking for group suicide everywhere but cant find one, anyone got any idea? Or should we just start our own chat room?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q2gkj4/failed_an_attempt_investing_on_a_second/", "title": "Failed an attempt, investing on a second.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "javktur", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633510790, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q2gkj4/failed_an_attempt_investing_on_a_second/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429249.9567924, "replies_charged": false}
