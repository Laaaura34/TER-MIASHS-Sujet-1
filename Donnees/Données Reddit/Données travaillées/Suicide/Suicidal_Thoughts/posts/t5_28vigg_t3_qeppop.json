I don't want to die but I know it'll be easier if I was dead for not just myself? But I'm also scared of dying. I think I just wish I didn't exist. \n\nYou know what else I'm scared of? Water. It's a stupid fear but the ocean, ponds, rivers, and lakes, scare me so bad that I almost pissed myself when someone wanted to help me get over it by slowly walking me into it. We were ankle deep. \n\nThough whenever I think of dying I think of drowning. Driving my car into a lake and drowning in it. To me this is the most peaceful way for me to do it and people around me might see it as an accident. I don't know why because I'm just so afraid of it but it makes the most sense to do. I thought on other ways but every fiber in my being wants me to drown \n\nDoes anyone else experience something like this?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qeppop/fearful_thoughts/", "title": "Fearful thoughts.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "INeedAdviceBadlyDude", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635072113, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qeppop/fearful_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428986.7973611, "replies_charged": false}
