Someone who tears you down nonstop and that can\u2019t be nice to you for a long time?  I think I\u2019m in love with a narcissist.  the lies, the yelling at me over every little thing.. being mean to me when things don\u2019t go their way- when the bad things in their life aren\u2019t even my fault.. I know I should wanna leave and I do, but I see the potential in this person.  at least I thought I did.  I know you can\u2019t fix people but I know I was the one person who\u2019s stayed through everything and forgiven a multitude of things.  I can\u2019t keep getting hurt anymore but this person doesn\u2019t stop blowing up my phone.  it causes me terrible anxiety, and makes me question my self worth.   this person will not listen to me though, this person will just say I\u2019m the problem.  I hate it.  I feel like I\u2019m never gonna get out of this or be happy again.  if you have any advice please share.. I feel bad going to my friends over this time and time again and I feel like they\u2019re just sick of hearing it", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/puu8mb/i_know_you_cant_fix_people_but/", "title": "I know you can\u2019t fix people but..", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "srdoz", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632523263, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/puu8mb/i_know_you_cant_fix_people_but/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429215.5584521, "replies_charged": false}
