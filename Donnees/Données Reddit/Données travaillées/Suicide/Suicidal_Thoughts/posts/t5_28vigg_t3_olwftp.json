For example- about a month ago I went out to eat with my girlfriend and her mom, dad and brother, everything was fine until we got our food... it was weird. I had this feeling everyone in the restaurant was looking at us and judging us and it made me feel this overwhelming sadness. I didn't wana be there anymore. I don't know of if that's a good representation of how I felt that night. It's just so hard to explain. Idk you know that feeling when your holding back tears. I feel that shit constantly ! I use to be happy now I get mad over stupid shit. I have no more patience . I feel like nothing. Honestly I just Wana run away but it wouldn't help cause I hate being alone. I feel like I'm in a never ending loop. I don't know what to do anymore.
