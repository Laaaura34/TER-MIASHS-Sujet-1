Why live for myself when I just end up sabotaging everything in fear of losing it? Every one in my life would either be better without my presence or wouldn\u2019t even notice the absence. I wanna take some para cord and hang myself from the bathroom doorknob. My roommates wouldn\u2019t notice at all, and my boyfriend is gone at work, but even he wouldn\u2019t check on me for a while after he got home. I\u2019m hoping I can just tighten the knot, slip down the door and try to knock myself out before my body slumps and I fully suffocate. Been thinking about using a door jam too, just in case. I\u2019m sure people would be a little sad, but it\u2019s definitely nothing compared to how I feel on the daily basis.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/oe8frr/everything_feel_hopeless/", "title": "Everything feel hopeless", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dontbeweirdman", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625495093, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/oe8frr/everything_feel_hopeless/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429271.5629914, "replies_charged": false}
