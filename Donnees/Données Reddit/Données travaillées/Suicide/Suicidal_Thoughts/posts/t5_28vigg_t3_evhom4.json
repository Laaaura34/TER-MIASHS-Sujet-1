For the past few weeks,, I\u2019ve been doing okay. I\u2019m on new meds and maybe just maybe life was going to go my way. I think we all know where this goes. I\u2019ve been convincing myself that I\u2019ve been getting better,, however that\u2019s not the case. I just bottle things up because I\u2019m tired of being the walking nutcase or the fucking pity party. I\u2019m tired of disappointing the ones that are the closest to me. I\u2019m tired of hearing or seeing my mom cry when I can\u2019t control what comes out of mouth. I\u2019m tired of latching  onto people,, and then just pushing them away. I\u2019m tired of therapy, tired of trying to keep my mind busy to deter the suicidal thoughts.. I\u2019m just.. tired. I\u2019m exhausted of trying to put on a happy face for the sake of others,, and myself. I just.. I wanna disappear,, erase myself from everyones memories,, go off the grid and never come back. The real fear of depression isn\u2019t dying,, it\u2019s living with yourself, forever. My war is spiritual,, and not fought inside a battlefield. Instead,, it\u2019s fighting and raging in my mind. It\u2019s so hard trying to convey the continuity of depression to people who have never had it,, no, I can\u2019t just smile,, no I can\u2019t just flip it on and off like a fucking switch. No,, I just can\u2019t \u201cstop being depressed\u201d.  \nMom, I\u2019m so sorry that I couldn\u2019t see the light at the end of this road. To be completely honest, I think I stopped looking for it a long time ago. None of this is your fault,, please don\u2019t suffer. Please, just accept the fact that I am peace with the war raging inside my head.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/evhom4/ive_fallen_and_i_cant_get_up/", "title": "I\u2019ve Fallen,, and I can\u2019t get up.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "eechibby", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1580271653, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/evhom4/ive_fallen_and_i_cant_get_up/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428902.9170883, "replies_charged": false}
