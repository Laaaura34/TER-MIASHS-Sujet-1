Bc im sick having to actually post something on reddit just to get total strangers ask hey need to talk or wanna talk or something in that range. And maybe just  having to come up with actual reasons to stay alive like \"he said he loves me\" or \"he called me cute\" like anything bc you have no reasons to live but one person that you constantly have on your mind. And you cry about bc your so worried that maybe they'll do something bad even tho they said they won't but you have no way of knowing that they mean it. Bc yeah ig its really sad when you meet someone 3-4 months ago and now u think about now how there your world and you just love them so fucking much and mean so much to you that sometimes you can't sleep bc u wonder if there really going to be fine or okay.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/otne46/ima_rant_because_i_really_wanna_cut_rn_but_trying/", "title": "Ima rant because I really wanna cut rn but trying really hard not to.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dinoinitxd", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627521018, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/otne46/ima_rant_because_i_really_wanna_cut_rn_but_trying/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429259.4766781, "replies_charged": false}
