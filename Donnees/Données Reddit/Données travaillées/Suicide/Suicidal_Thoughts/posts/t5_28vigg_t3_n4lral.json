There's so many things i could say but I just want to believe someone hears me at all, so I'm going to try make this easy to read. I'm so depressed. I don't really want to die but I'm so done being me I can't keep going like this. My mum kicked me out at the start of this year over some disagreements about the house rules, and I've been staying with my ex. I dated him for two years and we broke up at the start of the year. I ended it and we are on good terms but its still tense as neither of us are really over it. Some of the time I stay with our other friend, which is better(have my own room and a bed there) then staying with my ex, but I don't like staying with the friend much because I have to sneak in and avoid his parents. I feel so stuck. I stopped going to school and work, and lost my friends except for my ex and our one friend. I have no girl friends to talk to, and feel so abandoned by my mum. I just wish somebody wanted me, or to even listen to me. I'm writing all this because I'm really anxious about trying to go to sleep soon. I'm already so empty and lost and sad but when I lay down in the dark and quiet the pain gets so much worse. I feel it coming up my chest out my throat, and all I want is somebody to hold me and tell me im alright and ill be ok. I'm not even asking anything I just want someone to read this", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n4lral/f17falling_asleep_is_the_hardest_part/", "title": "(F17)Falling asleep is the hardest part", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NessiesNips", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620126866, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n4lral/f17falling_asleep_is_the_hardest_part/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429285.6104941, "replies_charged": false}
