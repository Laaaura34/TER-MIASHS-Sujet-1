No one cares about how you feel or how much you try, they just care about results. I got reminded of that by my own mother, that she prefers my brother., since he is easier to talk to, because he is smarter, and on a brighter career path. She was right when she said all those things when I was a child, that I'm a nobody, that I'm not special, that I can never achieve anything. I realized how much of a nuisance I was to her and my family. I tried to do as much good as I can for others, but in the end it doesn't amount to much, and so I'm a failure. I hope that when my end comes soon, at least I succeed no longer being a nuisance to others, that my mother would be happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o4gwmq/love_isnt_real/", "title": "Love isn't real", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Edward0112", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624228698, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o4gwmq/love_isnt_real/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429341.02556, "replies_charged": false}
