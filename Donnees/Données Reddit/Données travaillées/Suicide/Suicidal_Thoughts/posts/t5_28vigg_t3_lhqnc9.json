It\u2019s eternal peace from all your woes and the greatest vacation from whatever bullshit you deal with on a day to day basis. Just think of people who suddenly die overnight, I bet they were living life to the best of their ability and without a care in the world, then suddenly they\u2019re gone. Why is that? Why is that good people die suddenly, but I am still sucking up this precious oxygen someone else can enjoy? I\u2019ve had suicidal ideations for so long, I\u2019m too much of a coward to do it. The last funeral I went to somebody said \u201clook how peaceful she looks, she\u2019s resting now\u201d and that concept stuck with me.
