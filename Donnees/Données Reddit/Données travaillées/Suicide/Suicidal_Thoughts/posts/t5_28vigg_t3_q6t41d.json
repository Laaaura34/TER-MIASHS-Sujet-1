I blamed university and then left university feeling worse than I did when I was studying. I thought I had premenstrual depresssion and then realised I'm depressed every week, every day. There's nothing to blame anymore, I'm just depressed and I have been for a long time. I had a flashback today of 11 year old me typing \u201cgoodbye cool world\u201d on Facebook, so ready to end it all at that age. 10 years on, I don't know if I regret not doing it or I'm happy I didn't for younger me\u2019s sake? It's all confusing. I wake up everyday and think that today is the day I\u2019ll do it. Living feels like a chore and telling people how you feel is impossible! I made a post today that hinted to what I was feeling and the response to it was so tone deaf. It made everything worse. My one cry for help and it was met with careless responses. Nobody truly cares. They're all making my decision easier.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q6t41d/everything_feels_so_pointless/", "title": "Everything feels so pointless.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Substantial_Ad_7217", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634065160, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q6t41d/everything_feels_so_pointless/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428846.2846882, "replies_charged": false}
