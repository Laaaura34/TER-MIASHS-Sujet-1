My parents keep saying how everything is going to go to hell because Biden is winning. That everything will end as we know it. I was feeling depressed before all of this for unrelated reasons. But now I can't see a reason to keep going. Is it really as bad as they say it is going to be. I tried talking to them about it and how we should be positive but they think I'm stupid and need to come to terms with reality. That our democracy is going to end and we will become a socialist dictatorship. I am so scared and honestly I don't want to be here anymore. I just worry about my pets. Like what will happen to them if I die. Who will take care of my babies. Thats the only reason I'm even typing this. I guess I am too chicken to even do anything, I am such a failure.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jo9nrb/i_dont_know_anymore/", "title": "I dont know anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "guineapiggie95", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604540269, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jo9nrb/i_dont_know_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429362.3085434, "replies_charged": false}
