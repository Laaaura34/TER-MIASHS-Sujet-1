I've been on and off suicidal since I was 12 and I really wish there was a place to talk about that without worrying the people close to me, especially since some of them know I did actually try once. It mostly feels more like intrusive thoughts than my actual thoughts, but I'd really like my first response to anything going slightly wrong not to be \"ok, how best can I kill myself\" and walking myself through the most effective ways given my situation at the time. The thing that scares me most is that someone will stop me in the act. I really want to stop feeling suicidal to begin with, but it doesn't feel like there are spaces to talk about that without the risk of institutionalization. \n\nI'm at pretty low risk of acting on it because I know it would hurt the people in my life a lot, but that doesn't mean I want to keep feeling like this. Anyone have any comments/suggestions? Would welcome any of your own reflections on this as well.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hhoaqa/i_want_to_talk_about_suicidal_ideation_but_dont/", "title": "I want to talk about suicidal ideation but don't want to be institutionalized", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway_987987_", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1593384851, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hhoaqa/i_want_to_talk_about_suicidal_ideation_but_dont/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429404.274766, "replies_charged": false}
