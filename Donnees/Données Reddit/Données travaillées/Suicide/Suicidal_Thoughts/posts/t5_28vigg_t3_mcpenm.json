And now I hate myself even more. I fade into glimpses of insanity where my hands aren't my own and I hurt myself, I'm losing my mind, all I wanted was to be a good guy. How did i become such nothingness. Why dont I deserve to be loved for the kind caring soul i am? Why am i doomed to be miserable? I hate every morning i wake up, and i pray every nights to die before i go to sleep, and i dont believe in god. If only i had the courage to kill myself. Or to face my feelings. To be able to make a face when tears stream down my fucking face instead of looking myself in the mirror frozen like a psychopath.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mcpenm/im_doing_everything_i_can_to_numb_being_alive/", "title": "I'm doing everything I can to numb being alive", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "arnoxeouslol", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616644852, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mcpenm/im_doing_everything_i_can_to_numb_being_alive/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428922.3523362, "replies_charged": false}
