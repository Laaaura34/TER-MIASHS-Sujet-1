I\u2019ve been struggling with relationship issues since 2015, all the guys I\u2019ve met are those that will leave me after they are done using me\u2026 i feel more and more insecure. I feel like I need to give sex to guys for them to talk to me. I\u2019ve been actively trying to find a bf trying to find someone that can give me a shoulder to lean to. But when i found one it just didn\u2019t seem like the love i need as he was too busy to give time to me. Okay then other problem is with my parents, I don\u2019t have siblings and I don\u2019t get along well with my parents. Ended up I always don\u2019t feel like going home , i think maybe perhaps if i go hotels with different guys everyday\u2026 i will be cared for more and given more attention\u2026. I know it\u2019s not right to think this way but lord have mercy, i keep overthinking stuffs. I\u2019m driving myself nuts. \nI should probably just focus on my work now but the thought of being alone forever and no one that cares about me or stays with me just give me a lot of anxiety. It makes me lose hope to stay alive. I\u2019m really depressed. I feel like dying. It feels like there\u2019s nothing that can movitate me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o17jll/is_there_any_real_time_forum_that_i_can_post_to_i/", "title": "Is there any real time forum that i can post to , i have no one to talk or relate to, i feel depressed and upsets.
