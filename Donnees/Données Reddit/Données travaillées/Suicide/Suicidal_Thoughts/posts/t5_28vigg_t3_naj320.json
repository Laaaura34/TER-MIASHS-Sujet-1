I decided I want to die months ago because I'm tired but unfortunately, I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. I want to die but I don't want to suffer when I go. Hanging and slitting my wrists seems painful, I don't have an access to a gun, overdosing on opioids seems preferable but I need a prescription. I've thought about hiring somebody to kill me but I can't find anyone. I don't want to exist anymore so please don't convince me otherwise.
