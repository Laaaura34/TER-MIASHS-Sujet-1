Telling my partner wouldn't help, it would only stress her out and I don't want to be a problem I just want to not be so anxious all the time. But that's not an option. No health insurance, and I can't afford to pay a therapist and a psychiatrist out of pocket. I just go to the gym and walk for hours every night and watch mindless tv. I've lost too much weight too fast because I'm nauseous from anxiety, and there's literally nothing I can do about it. I can't even ask for time off work because we're so shortstaffed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mto3zb/we_really_be_out_here/", "title": "We really be out here", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Illustrious_Mixture8", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618788325, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mto3zb/we_really_be_out_here/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429226.0575538, "replies_charged": false}
