If you have been surviving miserable for so long, maybe even hurt the people around. If everyday is a fight. Why should i live?? Am i living for whom? Obviously not for me cause I have been miserable. What if i truly don't want to be part of this world. Yes i know it has amazing things but i am willing to give it up because i live in pain and cause more pain then good to the people around me. Why should i be shamed for making me  and everyone a big favor??\n\nI don't understand. Why do i have to trie a messed up thing to die? Why can i have a painless assisted suicide? Even murderes get to have painless deaths but i have to die in pain because society wants to force me to be alive even if i don't contribute anything positive and i don't want to be here.\n\nI genuinely believe that assisted painless suicide should be legal for some people with a severe degree of mental health.
