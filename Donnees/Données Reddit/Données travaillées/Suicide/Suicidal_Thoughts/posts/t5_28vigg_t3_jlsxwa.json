I don\u2019t want to kill myself. I don\u2019t even necessarily want to be dead. I just want to be happy. I just want to feel good and not have looming stress and bad feelings over everything I do.\n\nWhen i was younger i set a bunch of goals that I thought would make me badass once accomplished. Things i thought would make me feel really good to accomplish and say \u201chey, i did that!\u201d. But now as I\u2019m older and i\u2019m starting to do a lot of those things they don\u2019t make me feel good. I realized i haven\u2019t felt really great since i was a kid. The reality of everything i wanted to do has set in and it just doesn\u2019t seem like a world i would be happy living in.\n\nI only feel truly good when i\u2019m sleeping. To be able to sleep forever seems like the greatest thing ever. That\u2019s why i want to be dead. I just want to be in a dream that never ends. I got nobody i can talk to about this. My 2 friends would get overly concerned and I don\u2019t want to put this on them, parents make me feel ungrateful and cowardly, i can\u2019t afford therapy.
