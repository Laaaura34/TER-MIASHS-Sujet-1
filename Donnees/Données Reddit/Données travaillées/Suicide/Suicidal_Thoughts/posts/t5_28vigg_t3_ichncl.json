I won\u2019t bore you with my entire life story but I\u2019ve felt the need to say this for a long time. Since about age 13 I\u2019ve thought about hurting myself. A year later and I was in a deep depressed state and got the cops called on me due to a suicide attempt. Since then I took meds for a year then lied to my doctors saying I felt fine because I just felt like a robot, no emotions at all. Since then I\u2019ve held on but those thoughts of ending my life have always come back. This year has been odd for everyone. I\u2019ve been thinking of attempting to end my life seriously for the first time since my last attempt. Don\u2019t even get my started on other people, though that\u2019s not the reasoning of these thoughts. Honestly as silly as this may sound my body feels like it\u2019s been failing me for awhile now. Again I\u2019ll skip a lot of details but various areas of my body hurts and aches. I\u2019m trying whatever I can to make it stop but I feel I\u2019ve screwed it up to badly to fix. Just when it seems I fixed one issue a new one arises. And now I\u2019m hurting so bad psychically and hospitals are already busy enough I doubt anything could help. I\u2019m a ticking time bomb waiting for the day where something random will occur physically and it\u2019ll kill me. Unless I end my suffering myself..I\u2019ll keep waiting it out as best I can see if these issues eventually go away but I doubt they will..I know it might sound dumb but I just want all this mental and physical pain I feel to be over..\n\nSorry for the long and sorta vague post including all details would make this to long imo. But if you have made it this far thanks for listening.
