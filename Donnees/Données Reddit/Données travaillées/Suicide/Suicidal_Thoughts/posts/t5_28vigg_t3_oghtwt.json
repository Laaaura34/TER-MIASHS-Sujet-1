It\u2019s just if I ever do, I don\u2019t want to end up waking up in a hospital bed. I\u2019ve already failed so many suicide attempts, at this point it\u2019s embarrassing. I mostly failed because of the physical pain. If I do overdose, what would help make it for sure? Alcohol? Other drugs? Or would that make it more painful, or even increase my chances of surviving? I take a 40mg pill everyday and I believe I have a stock of about 30 pills. Would that be enough? If not, how much would be enough?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/oghtwt/would_overdosing_on_prozac_result_in_a_painless/", "title": "Would overdosing on Prozac result in a painless death?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kazzytulane", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625782502, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/oghtwt/would_overdosing_on_prozac_result_in_a_painless/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429616.0601797, "replies_charged": false}
