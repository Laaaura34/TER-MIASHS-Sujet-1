To me it's simple, yet it isn't.\n\nMy younger sister has down syndrome, and where I live it is sometimes tough to find her medical attention. If only her older brother wouldn't be there so that their parents can pay the medical bills required.\n\nI'm a freshman, a mediocre one at best. I'm supposed to have a minimum of 148 IQ, yet I'm fucking failing almost every class I have. My freshman advisor is busting her ass off to help me but I keep failing her.\n\nSimilar to her, my teachers take so much of their free time helping me.\n\nEven worse, the few friends I have only include me with them for pity, and I make their interactions way more uncomfortable.\n\nI'm one of the four drummers at a band, and I'm the worst one. I keep on playing songs that they could play so much better than me.\n\nI always put others before me, always. So, when I think about how easier life would be for everyone if I just erased myself from them I feel bad, because it is so easy yet so tough to do. I'm fucking tired, of everything. I need help from someone who isn't paid to help me. Please, I hate to ask things from others, but please, if anyone could help me, it would mean everything to me.\nLiterally everything.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/fmx1k4/im_just_extra_weight/", "title": "I'm just extra weight", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "wokettroketshoket", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1584868084, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/fmx1k4/im_just_extra_weight/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428902.5064309, "replies_charged": false}
