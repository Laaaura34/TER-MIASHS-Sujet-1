It stems from trauma that I can\u2019t escape from. It causes extreme anxiety, depression, inability to function in social situations which in turn causes me to only be alone. Any relationship I try to have for the rest of my life will be effected by my trauma. I think about suicide a lot. I want to kill myself. I don\u2019t see me ever having a happy life. I was going to kill myself this weekend. But my friend is keeping me at his house and is kind of stopping me from leaving. I know he cares, and would feel hurt if I did it. But I don\u2019t see suicide as selfish. Some people just need out of the pain that doesn\u2019t seem to end. I\u2019ve tried to move past it but it\u2019s always there, right at the front of my mind. I even fantasize about suicide as I fall asleep. I don\u2019t know how to solve this", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p00l1d/i_dont_see_me_lasting_much_longer/", "title": "I don\u2019t see me lasting much longer", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Prothe2nd", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628367568, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p00l1d/i_dont_see_me_lasting_much_longer/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428848.8528082, "replies_charged": false}
