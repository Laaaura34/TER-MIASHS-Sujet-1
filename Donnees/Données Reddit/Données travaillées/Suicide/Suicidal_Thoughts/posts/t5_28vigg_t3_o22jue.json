My husband was my best friend and only one I ever considered family aside from my pets. My cat also passed last February. Now it\u2019s just me and my dog. My dog is the only reason I can\u2019t kill myself, I don\u2019t trust anyone would take him in. We are both rejects of the world. \nEvery day, every hour and minute feels unbearable. I have no emotional support, not even from healthcare or grief support groups. I suffer from long term depression and anxiety since childhood. I suppose I have always been a challenge to be around with, but my husband faced that challenge head on. He\u2019s the only one who truly has. He gave me self-worth. But prior to his death by cancer, the last months with him were so painful and hard. My life continues being just that. I just want out. Help does not exist for me, and I\u2019m too tired to even try to seek it anymore. There\u2019s just so much rejection I can handle.\nMy dog probably has still 5-8 years to live, and I don\u2019t know I can manage the years to come.\nI honestly would love everyone I know having to deal with me having killed myself. Only shame that I wouldn\u2019t be able to witness it.\nJust needed to vent.
