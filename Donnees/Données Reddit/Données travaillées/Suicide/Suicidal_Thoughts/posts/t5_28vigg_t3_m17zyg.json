Both my parents have various mental disorders. I have BPD and major anxiety disorder. Every single day of my life I feel like I'm not okay. I'm never enough nothing I do ever makes a difference it goes unnoticed. I've had major issues w addiction as most of us with BPD do. But every single day I fantsize about just ceasing to exist. I've tried counseling and psych wards a million different med combinations. I love my kids and my husband but I feel like after they morun me they would be better off without my episodes and constant relapses. They don't deserve to have to deal with it anymore and I just want it all to stop and no matter how hard I work at changing. It just never really works. I know suicide hurts those who love you and they think they need you around. But at what cost. I'm doing more harm than good and after all I've seen and been thru and put others thru I just don't feel like I deserve to be here with my family that I should just disappear and end it all because I know they'd be better off for it in only a few months..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/m17zyg/the_inescapable_feeling/", "title": "The inescapable feeling..", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Beautiful_Poetry_158", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615301579, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/m17zyg/the_inescapable_feeling/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429229.687039, "replies_charged": false}
