I know I know I have made it this far and I can go longer and that ppl have got my back I know. People have told me they love me but I don't feel(?) that love , and I hate myself so so much for that. Well not only that but yea you get the point. I just don't know anymore like I want to just sit with a person and tell them in excruciating detail about everything I think is wrong with me and why I have that self image and how I sh and how I fantasize about dying and stuff and how I plan it and how it feels when I kms in my dreams... But I don't wanna do that to a person because they do not exist to listen to what I've got to say they exist in their worlds and it somehow collided with mine unfortunately and I grew so dependent on their support that I want them to know every disgusting part of me and see if they'll still stay, genuinely and not out of guilt or the feeling of being tied to me. I know this post has no structure what so ever but it's way past my bedtime and I'm sleep deprived and I can not make world's do and maintain a structure", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mvmj8n/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/", "title": "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ampinklamp", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619030996, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mvmj8n/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429071.1725655, "replies_charged": false}
