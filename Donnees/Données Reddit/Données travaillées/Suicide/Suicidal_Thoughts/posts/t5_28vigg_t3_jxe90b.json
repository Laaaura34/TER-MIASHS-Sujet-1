Like my life stopped at 21 because that\u2019s when i wanted it to stop and now I\u2019m just here existing. I don\u2019t see why I need to do anything or why I\u2019m alive because I\u2019m like already dead and wouldn\u2019t really care if I did die right now.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been depressed for so long and recently I found out my abusive dad had been that way throughout my childhood and not just my pre teens and teens as well. It\u2019s really fucked me up since I have blocked out most of my childhood and have no memories of my dad from that time. I feel like I never really had a chance. It seems so easy for everyone else to just take that step but I feel like I\u2019m too deep to even do anything right now and even if I did do I even want to be here until I\u2019m 50? 40? 25? I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t see it but I can\u2019t see any future cause it already ended", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jxe90b/i_feel_like_i_already_died/", "title": "I feel like I already died", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tradethissleep", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605829911, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jxe90b/i_feel_like_i_already_died/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429037.276441, "replies_charged": false}
