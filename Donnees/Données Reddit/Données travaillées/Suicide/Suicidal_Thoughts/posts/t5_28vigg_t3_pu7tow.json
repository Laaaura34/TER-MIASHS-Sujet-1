The entire state of the world is making these feelings significantly worse.\n\nThe level of pain I am in currently makes me want to lay down and never get back up. I would love for the earth to just consume me. Sometimes I have hope and can see a light shining from the future, and then there are times like right now where I see no point in anything. I can't take care of my basic needs or move forward while I'm stuck in this pit of misery. Who would actually want to live like this?\n\nHoping getting it out here will do anything positive and help me to move forward. I wish this sub didn't have to exist and I wish people reading this didn't relate to my pain, but I know you will.\n\nSending love to everyone \u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pu7tow/hoping_to_externalize_my_thoughts/", "title": "Hoping to externalize my thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Throwaway285848", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632441115, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pu7tow/hoping_to_externalize_my_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428847.8168552, "replies_charged": false}
