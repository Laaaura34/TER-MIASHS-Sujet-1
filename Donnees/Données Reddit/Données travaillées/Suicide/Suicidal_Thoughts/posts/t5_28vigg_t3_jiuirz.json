I grew up in a mentally abusive environment with my dad and my mom. Around the age of 8 my dad left me with my mom, sister , and brother. Over the years I was convinced my suffering was from his abuse, but recently I've been able to see through my mom's bullshit and now I see how manipulative and abusive she is. She constantly guilt trips me and makes it well known that I'm a burden in her life. She always has to yell at me for my grades, my attitude, my looks, my social life, and stuff like that. Recently she's been trying to make it seem like I'm crazy and she is going to send me to live at my dad's with no items that she bought, she's gonna make my dad buy everything for me to wear, use, and eat. I've been thinking about running away or just commiting. The only problem I have with commiting is that I really want to serve in the military before I go, it's a very weird thing but it's all I got to keep me going. If anyone has anything they wanna say that could help me out please say it.
