I am an Aspergers sufferer and as a result I have really bad social anxiety. This stops me being able to just go out and find anything meaningful. That and I have zero confidence in my body or appearance. \n\nWhen I do find someone I like the always don\u2019t like me the same way and I get friendzoned and their I stay. It\u2019s not their fault they don\u2019t like me that way and I don\u2019t blame them in anyway. But I do tend to spend my time in unrequited love quite a lot and for many years. Most of the time I am happy enough just having the companionship but it always hurts like hell when they end up getting into a relationship because I know I can never be the special one or the one that comes first. \n\nThis is a very painful experience and leaves me feeling hurt and rejected. Again I\u2019d like to say that I don\u2019t blame the other person for not wanting me that way. It\u2019s not their fault. Although I have to admit that I wish they saw me that way.\n\nSo things never seem to work out for me in love and things never work out for me socially and things never work out for me from a stability angle either. It\u2019s been this way my whole life. No friends, no real love life just emptiness.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much more I can take. Just the constant loneliness is killing me. I just want to get a hug and some sort of affection to make me feel wanted at least. I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s ever going to happen however. I know I can\u2019t go on like this forever. I the alternative is suicide to end the pain of my loneliness.\n\nSo at this point I need to point out something. I\u2019ve had unkind comments before calling me a \u201csimp\u201d or \u201cincel\u201d I\u2019m neither of this things I\u2019m a man who\u2019s struggling to achieve which others achieve easily because of my condition. I am suicidal because I can go on anymore feeling alone. I\u2019m scared for a future alone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pzphzt/feeling_so_run_down_and_starved_of_human/", "title": "Feeling so run down and starved of human affection.
