If someone finds me, or if I wake up miserably sick, or the doctors revive me... I mean. I know what will happen. They\u2019ll put me in some inpatient program, then I\u2019ll get home. And my mom will never get off my case. It will be so many comments, and complaints, and etc about the money. \nThe fucking money. It will never be about me. It\u2019ll always be about her. If I ask her to stop, I\u2019ll get manipulated until I tell her it\u2019s okay. \nI\u2019m just so fucking tired. \nThanks for reading.
