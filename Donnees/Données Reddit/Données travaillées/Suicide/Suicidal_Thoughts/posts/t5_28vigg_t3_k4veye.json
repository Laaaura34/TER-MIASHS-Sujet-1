Like, it's hard to explain but I feel so weird and everything aches. It's like an overall fatigue that plagues every part of my body which makes me desperately want to leave this world for some time. \nI've read before that such recurring thoughts can be specified as suicidal thoughts or tendencies, tho I've never made specific plans and stuff like that. I don't even think that I'll have enough courage and energy to go through with ending my life. It's also not like that I don't have hope for a better future cause - there always is - but in certain moments I just feel so helpless.\nI'm sorry for venting so much and probaly going off topic but I'd really like to know if my thoughts can be seen as early suicidal tendencies.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/k4veye/are_those_suicidal_thoughts_or_am_i_overthinking/", "title": "Are those suicidal thoughts or am I overthinking?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mochiisartz", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606860597, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/k4veye/are_those_suicidal_thoughts_or_am_i_overthinking/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429418.3080833, "replies_charged": false}
