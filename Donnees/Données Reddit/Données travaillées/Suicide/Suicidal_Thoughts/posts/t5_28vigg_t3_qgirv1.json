Especially if the person was never loved since before birth? Don't tell me \"it gets better\". It doesn't. Try being depressed since you were six & sexually assaulted since you were a baby. Tell me how that'll ever get better. This life is pointless. We all die one d at so why does it matter if 1 person dies \"early\"? I'm done in this life. I want it to end. I want it to end so much.\n\nIt hurts. I have so many scars & so much trauma yet it feels so invalid. I feel like i should be happy for having a family & stuff but I'm not. If i kill myself it'll be all okay.\n\nI have 2 notes written; one for my family & friends & one for my best friend.
