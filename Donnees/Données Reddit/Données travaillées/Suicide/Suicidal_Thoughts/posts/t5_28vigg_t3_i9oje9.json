Like everyone told me to do. Talk to your family, they said. They\u2019ll want to help you, they said. \nThey lied. My mom told me to my face that suicide is selfish. That she thinks I\u2019m irrational and all her reasons for me to stay alive focus on her. My little brother agrees. \nIt just feels so fucking heavy on my heart. I wanted help so badly. I finally let myself think there was some sort of hope. Maybe I\u2019d be okay, because the people I love so very much would wanna help me. \nAnd all I get is guilt tripped and lied to.
