I edge closer and closer to my absolute breaking point. Maybe it's just me forgetting how bad it was because there's so much time in between episodes. This one feels unique though in the fact that I am constantly bombarded by a brain that won't shut the hell up. Every thought has to be analyzed in some way. I doubt every memory I have and I don't know why. My memory in general just seems to be getting worse. (I'm 21) On top of that, I'm having mood swings that range from normal to numb to depressed to anxious, and sometimes it's just a mix. Before I either had no reason to want to kill myself or I wanted to do it out of laziness/general nihilism. Now it's legitimately I feel like I'm being tortured by my own brain. I'm in so much emotional pain, I can't take it anymore. I'm sick of feeling alright for months at a time just to be sent back to square one. I even invalidate my own feelings by thinking I'm just being dramatic. The worst part is I'm too cowardly to actually do it in a way that isn't quick and painless, and that's all I have access to right now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hem00d/it_gets_worse_every_time/", "title": "it gets worse every time", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheInkling9000", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1592943007, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hem00d/it_gets_worse_every_time/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429481.2780924, "replies_charged": false}
