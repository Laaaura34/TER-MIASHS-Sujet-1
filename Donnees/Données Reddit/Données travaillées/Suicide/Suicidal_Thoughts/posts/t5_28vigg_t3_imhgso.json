My mom is always telling me i should study like i dont do it but i do study im just incredibly stupid. Im never gonna get a job, im not gonna be anything in life, and i really wanna blame the crappy educational sistem but it's all on me because im never gonna be enough to have a remotely decent life.\n\nNow im just sitting here in my room crying and imaging how sweet it would be if i killed myself, or at least even try. I genuinely don't see myself as an adult. It doesn't matter what i wanna do when im older, im not gonna do it because im not enough, i dont think im ever even gonna grow older.
