I tried getting a job. I graduated 2018. I'm 21. And I feel deep in my soul that I didn't want the job my degree gets me but I tried getting one. And then covid hit and so I didn't go to job huntings anymore. And been living off my fathers house. But you know I really dont do anything. I just clean sometimes. And my sibling 20 and 18 are still in school. Whenever we argue they always say for me to leave the house and get a job. Worthless. They say dad already did his part  so I should leave and its true . Its true. I am just so tired. I have no purpose in the world really. I dont feel like working maybe this is just an excuse but you know its not really rewarding to be alive anymore. I am just so tired.\n\nBut I think I'm all right. I will be fine. Just wanted to share this. Cause I dont think I can keep it to myself anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/kfywrk/so/", "title": "So", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sensitivelittleshit8", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608343122, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/kfywrk/so/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428923.5998375, "replies_charged": false}
