But during one week, I was particularly struggling. I was feeling anger towards everyone. I was thinking about uprooting my entire life and leaving everything behind. Then I thought that horrible thought. Jumping in front of a car. Or taking all my pills. Right when I thought that, it was time for my therapy appointment. So I wanted help. I really wanted help this time. So I told him about my suicidal thoughts, and then I told him I had them at latest as that day. I was gone. Police were called and I was gone. I was taken to the hospital. And I sent a week there. And now I'm so drugged up on pills I don't know what I feel. I'm so tired, I can't eat without feeling nauseous, I have problems using the bathroom, I'm dizzy. I do feel happier, but maybe that's cause I can't really feel anything. I just feel high.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mw4qim/had_the_cops_called_and_sent_to_a_psych_ward/", "title": "Had the cops called and sent to a psych ward...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "brinewtea", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619098084, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mw4qim/had_the_cops_called_and_sent_to_a_psych_ward/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429309.0429063, "replies_charged": false}
