Life seems to dull and it's like trying to walk through unrelenting fog. I'm like, too tired to continue to live anymore. Like, getting dressed or brushing my hair is just kind of pointless. I feel like no one really cares about how I'm doing, just that I'm not openly whining about it. My mom keeps patronizingly asking \"should I worried about you committing suicide or something? Like is it bad or are you just dramatic as hell?\" Honestly? I'm thinking about it? Like is that what she's expecting? Is that what it will take to show that she loves me more and give me some support? I don't know. I don't mean to be rude. I just want to be able to see anything other than gray. I'm sick of hearing \"it gets better\". It was supposed to get better when the abuse stopped. It was supposed to get better when I got older because I \"just needed time\". It was supposed to get better when I stopped being self destructive. It's been 4 years and I still have nightmares. I still have flashbacks and panic attacks. I want it to be better, but it doesn't seem like it ever will be. I'm so damn tired. I'm so, so, so tired.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/gzfcnc/not_sure_if_this_is_the_place_for_this_but_i_kind/", "title": "Not sure if this is the place for this, but I kind of just need to unpack.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SilkZilk", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1591674717, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/gzfcnc/not_sure_if_this_is_the_place_for_this_but_i_kind/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428814.0868866, "replies_charged": false}
