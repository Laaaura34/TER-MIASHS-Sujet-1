I'm at a crossroads in life at 33 and I need to get my shit together but covid is delaying it all. I just feel like I'm gonna be so behind and have wasted too much time by the time this is all over. I feel guilty with every passing day that goes by. The winter pandemic is really eating away at my mental state. No sunlight and barely any socializing is a recipe for depression. It is feelings of being trapped with the uncertainity and realization that it's not going to end anytime soon.\n\nWhen it comes to death I think of scenarios like what if I just took my hands off the wheel of a car? What if I just decided to jump off this building? What if I just decided to kick that baby walking on the ground? I don't want to do it but shit like this crosses my mind, how easy it could be for me to do, and that's what scares me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ks1xai/if_i_think_about_death_a_lot_but_dont_want_to/", "title": "If I think about death a lot but don't want to kill myself what is that?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "alamurda510", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609981534, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ks1xai/if_i_think_about_death_a_lot_but_dont_want_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428953.912969, "replies_charged": false}
