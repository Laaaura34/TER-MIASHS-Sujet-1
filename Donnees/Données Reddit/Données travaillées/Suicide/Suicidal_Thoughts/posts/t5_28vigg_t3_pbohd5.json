I know it was scummy to tell them last minute, but I've been in and out of hospital because I fucking sliced my finger on a fence and had to get stitches. I've also been trying to complete all the other work they gave me while only having one day to actually work on this presentation.\n\nSo obviously I'm overwhelmed and stressed as fuck.\nI tell the teacher this, she doesn't see my email, so I get an email from the Head of Department saying that they didn't know why I wasn't in today. I resent the email I'd sent to my teacher, and now she's mad at me.\n\nI'm fucking sorry I'm a useless fucking idiot, but I'm trying to get through everything without fucking killing myself.\n\nI wanted to email her back and tell her 'you know why I cut my finger? Because I was trying to climb over a fence so I could walk onto the train tracks and get hit by a train.' unfortunately I slipped and then my finger started to bleed a shit tone. I wish I'd just jumped over the fence and gotten myself run over I'm so tired of this shit.\n\nI feel so pathetic but I just can't deal with certain things atm. I really want to drop out but then I wouldn't be doing anything and my depression would probably get even worse.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pbohd5/im_so_fucking_tired_and_angry/", "title": "I'm so fucking tired and angry", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "untitled-png", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629938453, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pbohd5/im_so_fucking_tired_and_angry/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428838.299575, "replies_charged": false}
