They make me feel terrible and it\u2019s hard to forget the things they have done. They\u2019ve told me to kill myself and even the look they give me hurts my soul. I walk on eggshells when they are around and i can feel my heart viciously pump when i do something wrong and they reprimand me.\n\n  I cry every time i talk about them but i still love them, so much but they don\u2019t love me. I hate them but i\u2019ve never had a stable home ever since i was born. I was in the system then moving from different family members from there.sometimes i stand in their room and wonder what i\u2019ve done to them to not want me. I\u2019m only here because her ex husband saw the situation i was in and not even my own family wanted me. It\u2019s hard to think about and i plan on running away, to where i don\u2019t know. but i wished with all my wishes they loved me like they love their kids.
