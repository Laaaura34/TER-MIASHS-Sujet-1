It would be a rather long one though. I would probably address the main reason i am depressed, address the only point in the last 15 years i was genuinely happy (2014/15) and apologize to everyone who may be hurt by my departure. \n\nLastly, i would probably throw in the line \"Parting isn't sweet sorrow. It's just plain sweet\". For reference, this is a line from the law & order episode \"Hitman\" where the deceased hires someone to kill him and leaves behind a video tape explaining why he did what he did. Oh, i would also include assurances to my mother that my suicide is not her fault. After all, its not her fault i was born the wrong biological sex, not her fault i was born autistic and not her fault im a dud. Its just the roll of the dice i got in life. \n\nBasically, if you were to take your own life, would you include a suicide note?
