I have no parents, no family, my only child barely knows I exist and my marriage is officially falling apart... He's beyond help.  This is my second marriage and I don't want to go through another divorce and starting over. I'm unemployed and have several traumas in my past. \n\nI just can't do it anymore. I'm in physical pain and sadness all the time. \n\nI don't have any desires or dreams for the future. I don't care about life experiences or causing anyone pain.... No one really will notice or care. My husband and father have both told me in the past to \"go do it\" when I was crying out in pain and sadness. \n\nI hate this world. It's shit. Shit for women. \n\nI'm so done.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nxroe8/i_have_nowhere_and_no_one_and_im_tired/", "title": "I have nowhere and no one, and I'm tired.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Xx_SwordWords_xX", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623449554, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nxroe8/i_have_nowhere_and_no_one_and_im_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429111.2911465, "replies_charged": false}
