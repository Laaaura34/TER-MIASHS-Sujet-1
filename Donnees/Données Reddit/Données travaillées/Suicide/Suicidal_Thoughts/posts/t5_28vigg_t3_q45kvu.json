Just feel so unloved and unattractive. It\u2019s left me feeling so low and depressed as if I\u2019m nothing and my efforts futile. I know I\u2019m not attractive in a typical sense. I\u2019m getting older abs I\u2019m over weight but I try to look my best. But it just doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m just over looked and brushed off. Just want someone to let be me. It hurts so much to not receive the love you give out. I\u2019m a depression sufferer anyway and just lately it\u2019s got worse. I just wake up feeling I\u2019d be better off dead the living through this pain!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q45kvu/probably_should_have_just_ended_it_all_instead_i/", "title": "Probably should have just ended it all.
