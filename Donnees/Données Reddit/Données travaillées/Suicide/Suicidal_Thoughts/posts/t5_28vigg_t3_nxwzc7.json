I said things that I shouldn't have. Immediately after when no one was watching I felt awful. I kept telling myself that this is not what I wanted to say and started feeling so bad about myself. Lately my life has been in a big slump and I can't see a way out, not even close. The anger and frustration building up everyday coupled with constant anxiety attacks are just too much to handle for me and is altering my decisions, keeping me up at night, making me duller everyday. I don't like watching people dear to me suffer which is also why I don't have the guts to end my life, I've tried multiple times now. I wanna seek the help of a therapist but since part of that slump is not being able to financial fund myself well enough, I can't. My problems have started affecting people around me too and that is making me even more sad. I often wonder how others deal with it. What do I do? I don't see a way out, is ending myself the only choice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nxwzc7/frustration_anger_and_sorrow/", "title": "Frustration, Anger, and Sorrow", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nobullypl", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623466810, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nxwzc7/frustration_anger_and_sorrow/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429222.114648, "replies_charged": false}
