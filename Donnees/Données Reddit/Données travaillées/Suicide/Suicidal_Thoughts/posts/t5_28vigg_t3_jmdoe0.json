I mean, you die eventually so why not let me end my life a little early? Life's depressing as fuck. Nobody has ever treated me right in any kind of relationship which makes everything worse. I'm currently shaking like hell & having a panic attack at the moment Cuz I know I'm not gonna make it to my birthday which is in less than 2 months without attempting suicide again. I'm just a kid who has already decided he wants to die before he even hits 18. I'm just a kid who hates his dysphoria & wishes he could've been cisgender. Maybe I will be a cisgender guy in another life. But being a trans guy makes depression worse knowing I'll never be cisgender. I've self harmed multiple times to feel pain somewhere other than my mind but it never helped. I'm fucking ready to die now. I might as well die cuz there's nothing to life for.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jmdoe0/fuck_life/", "title": "Fuck life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "satanic_bxtch09", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604277724, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jmdoe0/fuck_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429622.0906174, "replies_charged": false}
