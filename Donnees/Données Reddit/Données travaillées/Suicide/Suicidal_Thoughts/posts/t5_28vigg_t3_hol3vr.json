Everyone wants a quick and painless way to go, but that is not the case to some. People will say \u201csuicide is never painless it hurts others\u201d like no shit Sherlock Holmes. Anyways some people say overdose is the best way to have a \u201cpainless and quick\u201d self inflicted death, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. Anyone have theories or facts on what would be the most \u201ccomfortable\u201d self inflicted death?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hol3vr/not_suicidal_just_very_curious/", "title": "NOT SUICIDAL JUST VERY CURIOUS", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jelliott02", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594368726, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hol3vr/not_suicidal_just_very_curious/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429579.9081502, "replies_charged": false}
