Drugs didn't work against it and now I am starting to suffer from sleep deprivation because of it, also I lost all abilities to count without the use of somewhere to write down numbers and I keep fainting over sleepiness. The worst part is that I now started to hear voices, like someone screaming in my head, not many times but still sometimes in a day, I also suffer from sleep paralysis since this started and trying to sleep has become impossible. I am afraid of going to sleep. This is unbearable, I think daily about suicide, but I don't want to make some people feel sad about my death. It's horrible.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nmpl5w/suicide_is_amongst_some_of_the_only_things_i_can/", "title": "Suicide is amongst some of the only things I can still think about", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "IMadeThisAccToJerk", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622175651, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nmpl5w/suicide_is_amongst_some_of_the_only_things_i_can/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428742.2411065, "replies_charged": false}
