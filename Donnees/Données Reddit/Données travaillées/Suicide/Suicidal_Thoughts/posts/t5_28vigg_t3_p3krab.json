My health is worse than ever, my heart, my stomach, my chest, everything hurts and keeps me from functioning. I\u2019m shaking while I\u2019m writing this and I\u2019m just too tired, too tired man. \nI wish I could at least stop feeling, I wish there was a solution that could allow me to live as I\u2019d like to", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p3krab/feeling_anxious/", "title": "Feeling anxious", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PastelEmoFairy", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628850700, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p3krab/feeling_anxious/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429218.548516, "replies_charged": false}
