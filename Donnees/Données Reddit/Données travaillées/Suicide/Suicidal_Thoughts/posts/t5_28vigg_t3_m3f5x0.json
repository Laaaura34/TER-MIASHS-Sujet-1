Just the other day we were talking about a future together. I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel like she\u2019s ripping that future away from me. I want nothing else in the world than to be supportive, but I don\u2019t know what to say. Nor where I should start. She\u2019s also told me that I\u2019m the main reason she\u2019s still living. How do I even respond to that? She\u2019s even considered breaking up just so we wouldn\u2019t be together if she does decide to do it. I love her with every fiber of my being. I just don\u2019t know what to tell her.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/m3f5x0/my_girlfriend_has_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "My girlfriend has suicidal thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NotAnneFrank__", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615546384, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/m3f5x0/my_girlfriend_has_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429416.960587, "replies_charged": false}
