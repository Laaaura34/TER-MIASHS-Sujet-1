I've been abused, used, tossed to the wayside, abandoned, hurt. ive tried everything to escape, and even when my mind leaves my body, i cant get away. there is no relief. i cant even partake in or perform the things i love and held- hold- so dearly to my heart and my person anymore. there is no sleep to even get a blacked out break from the day, to get a break from standing and pacing and aching and fighting myself all day sans cesse and when i finally do? my eyes are open again in what feels like seconds, or i become plagued by the horrors of my dreams- memories, most often. \n\nevery time i've tried- suicide, i mean- even as a five year old, purposely running out into traffic, clearly i have not been successful. i've had more than a camp's crowd worth of lethal cocktails, overdoses, you name it yet my body acts as if it's a borg from star trek next gen; hit, adapt, hit, adapt, continue like nothing. i don't want to continue on, i don't want to adapt, i don't want to have a tolerance, i don't want to be here. i haven't wanted to be here since my wasted mind was capable of conceiving the bloody thought.\n\ni'm with a partner who i love (unfortunately) unconditionally, yet they hurt me constantly, they don't listen, they're inconsiderate, etc., yet i'd feel utterly lost without them. i feel like a little bitch admitting to that, to this, especially as a male. i know that that shame in and of itself is what society, for the relative most-ish part, is trying to move away from with its whole lot o' movements and emotional liberation-vulnerability hoo-hah, which i'm all for... but it's a whole 'nother story when it's directed at yourself.\n\nwhen this pandemic started, i ended up moving in with my partner and his family. none of us thought it would be lasting this long, not even close as we now all near our second birthdays in this quarantine. we didn't think that so many people and governments would be so ignorant and stupid, that we would lose so many stupid fucking friends, or that such severe conditions would develope in my body. i feel horrible about it, being here, being a burden not only on my own family but now on my partner's family despite the amount of love they show towards me, the amount of dumbfounding support they try their best to always give and show. it'S utterly bizarre, to be honest. i'm not used to that. their care only adds to the exponential guilt that eats away at me every single day. a together-family has been an experience to... well, experience. family in one house, happiness around each other, doing things together, always seeing kokum and nimosom. i'm jealous, i'll be completely honest. i am extremely fucking jealous. and, in a fucked up way, i kind of hate them all for all being alive, all being around each other and together; being so happy and functioning and so \\*there\\* for each other and each others' dreams and aspirations; supporting each other no matter what, even if it's failure... supporting me, even though i don't deserve it. \n\ni hate being stuck inside all day, useless, aimless, suffering, watching everyone and the world go on and progress and develope, not getting better, having to deal with doctor after doctor after doctor and then losing the only ones along the way that i've actually clicked with. i am at a loss, struggling to re-find my culture after my grandmother passed, all of our cultural items shipped away, pawned off, gotten rid of for next to nothing without any consultation and without any regards to her wishes. she was my only reason to live, my only drive, the only thing that kept me going and gave me anything to look forward to or look up to. \n\ni apologise for how aimless and long-winded this rambling has been, especially to whomever gets through all of it. i feel very lonely, and very deeply sad in places within myself that i cannot reach, and in ways that i cannot express outwardly. this is a first for me, expressing things this way and as much as i have yet it still hardly chips the tip of the iceberg.\n\nif anyone has any input, or would be at all interested in sparking up some private dialogue, i would be grateful but of course it is not at all expected. i appreciate the time anyone reading this has taken out of their day or night to give me and my words, as well as the words of everyone here whether it be long winded or a mere sentence and title.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/m3ykst/i_am_at_a_loss_and_have_been_for_a_very_long_time/", "title": "i am at a loss, and have been for a very long time.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gargarroyle", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615607892, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/m3ykst/i_am_at_a_loss_and_have_been_for_a_very_long_time/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429078.437829, "replies_charged": false}
