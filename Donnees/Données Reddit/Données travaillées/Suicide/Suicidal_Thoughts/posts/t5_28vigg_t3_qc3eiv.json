It's just hard how others can get such high grades without making much effort. I've been so down lately and I am starting to lose interest with everything again. I've felt that nothing good is happening. I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. I've been feeling like I am a failure even if I don't even wanna think of it. It comes out in my mind naturally. I don't know what to do, I'm just so lost with everything. I felt like I am the most stupid, useless person in the world. I don't even know why I was even born. I felt like I'm not even good at anything. I'm only good at annoying the people around me. Please help me I just can't take it anymore. I don't wanna lose myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qc3eiv/i_need_some_encouraging_words/", "title": "[I need some encouraging words]", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tagurohunstrez", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634743553, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qc3eiv/i_need_some_encouraging_words/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429334.148161, "replies_charged": false}
