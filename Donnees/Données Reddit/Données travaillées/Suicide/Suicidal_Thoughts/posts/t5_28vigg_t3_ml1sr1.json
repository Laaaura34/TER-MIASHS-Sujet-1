Was going to today but I couldn't get the rope over the tree branch. Another failure added to the list. My plan is to go back and finish the deed tomorrow. I recently dropped out of school due to my ever worsening mental health. Currently I work a phone/sales job. I got let out of work early today because my performance isn't up to par. Probably am going to get fired tomorrow. I've also been off my meds for a week due to insurance issues. Just need to draft my note tonight. I hope you all find the happiness I'm lacking", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ml1sr1/the_end/", "title": "The end", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Muten-97", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617677534, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ml1sr1/the_end/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429347.0552099, "replies_charged": false}
