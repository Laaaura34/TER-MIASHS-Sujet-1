This horrible, gory, frightening word sounds comforting like a warm blanket to me. Like a save haven. Like somewhere I can bring my thoughts to if everything gets to much. And this is sooo fucking not good. Its not good that when I plug in my headphones I think about suicide in a way that makes me calm down. I am not romanticing it. I know how shitty it feels. I\u2019ve been there, done that, multiple times. But still\u2026 when it gets just too much I plug in my headphones and think of a safe way out. I dont think I am ready to die. I was half a year ago. I probably would\u2019ve finished it half a year ago if I would not have met my friends. Now I want to make it. I want to live. Not necessarily healthy - I learned that I am not able to live healthy and without mental illness ever - but happy. In terms with myself. Maybe even knowing who I am and where I belong. I made it to 18 years now which is a huge thing. And I want to fight my way to 20. To 25. To 30. Maybe even 50. 90. But still\u2026 Suicide is comforting.
