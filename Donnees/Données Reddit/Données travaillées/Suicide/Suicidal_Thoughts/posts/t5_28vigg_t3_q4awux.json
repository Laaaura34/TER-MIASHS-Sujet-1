I thought id be dead by 14, then 16, then 20. I never thought id be here. But why? What for?\n\nNothing matters and no one will care about me until I m at absolute rock bottom or dead. Its a fun realization ive had to come to. Im becoming more reckless, less careful, less worried about getting hurt, because whats the worst that could happen? I DIE? Oh no, we wouldnt want that.\n\nI feel im becoming more numb and angry with myself. I cant do anything right and it fucking sucks. My head is a constant nightmare of anxiety and guilt and self hate. Im a miserable heap that is two steps away from completely shattering, but it doesnt matter. No one will notice. No one will care.\n\nI think about ending it all the time now. Not a day goes by that I dont vividly run through killing myself. I have a method, I have a back up. I dont know if it would work, but whats the harm in trying? Ya know?\n\nI dont even know why im typing here. Its not like this will change anything. I dunno. I guess... Lets see if I clock in to work tomorrow?\n\n\u270c\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q4awux/im_21_four_hours/", "title": "Im 21 four hours...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nononono196", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633740726, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q4awux/im_21_four_hours/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428986.0886593, "replies_charged": false}
