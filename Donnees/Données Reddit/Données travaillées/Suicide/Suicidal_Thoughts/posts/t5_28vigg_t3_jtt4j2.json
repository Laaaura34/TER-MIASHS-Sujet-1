I got out out of my shower one night, out my pjs on, nightgown etc. \nThen I got the urge. I don't know where it came from. At all.\n\nI took the tie from my dressing gown and made a noose and was in that moment, ready to hang myself from my shower curtain pole. \nObviously I didn't do it. I freaked out and immediately felt ashamed. But now I'm worried.\nIf it came out of nowhere, will it happen again? How long until it happens again? I haven't told anyone about this. I'm scared.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jtt4j2/i_almost_did_it/", "title": "I almost did it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SolidOne3284", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605317568, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jtt4j2/i_almost_did_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429513.0173368, "replies_charged": false}
