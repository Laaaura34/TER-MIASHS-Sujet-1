I used to be an A student. I thought I was doing everything right by choosing school over parties. The first year of college was the time I felt like I belonged. I felt like I could actually be someone. Then my mind just failed me. I started thinking my friends hated me. I stopped wanting to hang out. I was depressed and it came off as me looking angry so my friends thought I didn\u2019t want to hang with them anymore. I slept all day. \n\nAfter I left the hospital I had the bright idea of moving to another state for a fresh start. I felt that maybe I wasn\u2019t in the right place. First time I made it to my new city, I felt like I was where I was supposed to be. Then depression hit me again and I stopped going to this film internship I had. Couldn\u2019t go to class so had to drop the classes. Then got jobs and got fired from them\u2014no explanation given. Now I\u2019m back in school and have made straight As all school year so far, but I now realize I want more in life than just straight As. However, I\u2019m not consistent with anything I do because depression always sneaks back up on me. Since I never know when it\u2019ll come, I\u2019m fearful of even starting anything. I started a podcast but have been inconsistent with it. I can\u2019t expect my audience to grow if I\u2019m not consistent. And if the goal isn\u2019t to grow my audience, what\u2019s the point? Depression wrecks every area of my life. I\u2019m also insecure of the fact that my follower count on Instagram is so low. It\u2019s hard to have a podcast when you have no influence at all.\n\nI honestly feel safer just being depressed and not pursuing anything. Too much anxiety. I just want a chill life and I just want to be financially secure. I don\u2019t want to have to worry about survival my whole life but that\u2019s exactly where I\u2019m headed. People say I should be easy on myself but the truth is, patterns have already formed in my life and I\u2019m afraid that pattern is starting and never following through on anything due to fear of rejection and failure and also anxiety. So if that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s really no point in living. I don\u2019t want to feel like this my whole life. Classic case of how depression robbed me of every good thing that\u2019s happened in my life and has made sure my potential stays just that\u2014my potential without ever being actualized.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mmo7nw/depression_stole_everything_from_me/", "title": "Depression stole everything from me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "chewybacbacca", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617874930, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mmo7nw/depression_stole_everything_from_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428827.6723595, "replies_charged": false}
