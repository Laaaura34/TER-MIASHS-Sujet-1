I use humor and a facade to more or less get people thinking I'm okay. Im in a dead end job, half my friends died of OD, suicide or medical reasons and my parents only see my accomplishments and not me.. I turn 27 in about a week and a half roughly and a large part of me just wants to end things at 27. \n\nIm tired of hiding my feelings but therapy never helped, no one listened. And when im too blunt about my past issues with depression, they freak out. So then I just tell them I'm \"better\" and back to normal I guess. \n\nReligion doesn't help, music just reminds me of my constant thoughts of just falling off the face of existence. \n\nNot really a drug guy for obvious reasons but I do drink a little. But yeah, here I am I guess.
