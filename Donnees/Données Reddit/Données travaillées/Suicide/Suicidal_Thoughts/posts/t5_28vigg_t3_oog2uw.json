I feel lost, stuck and hopeless. I'm almost 30 and having nothing to show for it. I managed to stay off the booze for a year, so that's a plus. It just made my awful relationship crystal clear however. \nI used to be very headstrong, optimistic and driven towards my goals. No I feel weak, helpless and downright pathetic. \n\nI'm posting here because the next level down is back to contemplating an exit strategy\n\nI'm writing this while my wife drones on about some fucking love island reality tv show and I'm just fucking done \n\nI don't know what to do, nor do I know if I even have the will power to take advice or make a change. \nI need help.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/oog2uw/ive_started_feeling/", "title": "I've started feeling", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MrBurnsgreen", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626831599, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/oog2uw/ive_started_feeling/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429094.1099343, "replies_charged": false}
