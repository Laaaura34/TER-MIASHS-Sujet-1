I used to fantasize about it all the time. Fantasize about my future. It was my way of escape. It\u2019s why I didn\u2019t kill myself and went to therapy and believed all the professionals I saw when they said \u201cit gets better\u201d. I ended up in the psych hospital 2 times my senior year. One due to a suicide attempt. I still pushed on and barely graduated high school, after receiving mostly A\u2019s my entire grade school career. \n\nAnyways here are my failures after high school: \n\n\u2022got fired from 2 jobs and not given a reason why I was fired \n\n\u2022stopped going to a film internship I was hired at due to suicidal depression\n\n\u2022film I wrote didn\u2019t get made because I was broke and didn\u2019t know enough people to help\n\n\u2022stopped writing films altogether\n\n\u2022hospital once again\n\n\u2022more self harm cuts on my leg\n\n\u2022still have never been in a relationship \n\n\u2022lost a friend I actually liked being friends with because I was needy\n\n\u2022dropped about 7 classes in total\n\n\u2022the friends I made in college had to see me in the hospital, something no one should ever see\n\n\u2022lost all friends from college\n\n\u2022won\u2019t graduate with friends from college\n\n\u20223 years behind in college\n\n\u2022rarely talk to my little brother because he never calls even though we used to be very close\n\n\u2022Had a psychiatrist try to get me hospitalized for the 4th time\n\n\u2022Same psychiatrist dumped me as a patient\n\n\u2022probably won\u2019t ever get to enjoy sex due to a sexual side effect I wasn\u2019t warned about. Docs said the side effect would go away after cessation but they never did\n\n\u2022Have not been able to hold down a job\n\n\u2022all my hard work in grade school was meaningless. It amounted to nothing\n\n\u2022lonely majority of the time, a type of loneliness most won\u2019t ever experience\n\n\nWhy then should I even go on?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mr9o78/im_embarrassed_to_have_not_killed_myself_already/", "title": "I\u2019m embarrassed to have not killed myself already", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "chewybacbacca", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618471176, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mr9o78/im_embarrassed_to_have_not_killed_myself_already/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429343.1737487, "replies_charged": false}
