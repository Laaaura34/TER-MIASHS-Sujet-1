I worked out, pick up a few instruments, learned how to draw, played a lot of games, and tried out alot of different hobbies but, after all of that I don't feel satisfaction. I don't feel happiness, I just feel disappointment. I lost my dad when I was very young, my mom cut off all connections with our family and my mom is one of the reasons why I'm like this. My gf left me a month ago and my friends aren't really here anymore. I feel so lonely and I feel like I've done most of the things I wanna do in life and so I had the thought of ending it all. I tied up a noose and thought about it, if i go through it there's a chance that i might survive and will leave me with a life long injury so I got scared as usual. This might've been one of the times that all my problems caught up to me and one of my lowest points in my life. I rarely try to kill myself since I'm really scared of what might happen next. Its 4am and I couldn't sleep tonight and I just wanted to let it out.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/phcggp/generally_tired_of_everything/", "title": "generally tired of everything", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Watchun", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630698573, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/phcggp/generally_tired_of_everything/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428970.1052277, "replies_charged": false}
