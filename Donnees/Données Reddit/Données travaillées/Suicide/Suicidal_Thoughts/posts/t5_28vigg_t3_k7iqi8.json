I've been feeling like this since I was a teenager and I thought I would get better, and I try so hard to, but I still end up feeling empty and worthless. And I'm just scared that this will never go away; that I'll always feel like a fuck up. I'm basically friendless, I work a dead-end job, my family thinks I'm a loser. I think I might as well kill myself. I am trying to be more positive, to make changes, to do something, yet another year of my life passes anyway and still I want to die.\n\nI just can't imagine a future for myself whatsoever. I hate the question \"Where do you see yourself in 5-10 years?\" ummm idk, fucking dead? I can't plan for the future. I can't manage close relationships. Sometimes I think I'm missing something fundamental, like something is broken with me, and most of the time I either feel numb or suicidal. I've been pretending to be okay for so long, like faking confidence. \n\nThe typical advice hasn't worked for me...like: \"just go out and meet people! have a heart-to-heart with your family! etc. etc!\" I know it's well meaning, but I think there is something more going on, that I'm fucking up on a deeper level than that. I feel pathetic for even typing all this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/k7iqi8/what_if_it_doesnt_get_better/", "title": "what if it doesn't get better", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "5021wlr", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 17, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607212755, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/k7iqi8/what_if_it_doesnt_get_better/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429023.0370963, "replies_charged": false}
