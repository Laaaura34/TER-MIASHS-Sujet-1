Right now I'm shaking and the reason i got failed is that my depression and my low of confidence. I hated to be judge by my whole family and the other people too, Its seems my family won't allow their own to be failures and they sometimes hurting me for it, so i don't want to feel the pain and i want to ease the pain and the stress. Even they won't considered me to visit a therapist and they thinking that it would waste their money for it. (I Tried my best for to be the perfect son, but this is for who i am  a son who wanted to be understand and not to be judge as a failure)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/m0yja7/i_failed_and_i_just_wanna_die/", "title": "I failed and i just wanna die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DarthElixis", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615263423, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/m0yja7/i_failed_and_i_just_wanna_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429352.2583656, "replies_charged": false}
