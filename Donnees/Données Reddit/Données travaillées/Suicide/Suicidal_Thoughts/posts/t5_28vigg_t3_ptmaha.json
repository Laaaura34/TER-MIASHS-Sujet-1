I have been struggling with my college studies and have even failed one subject last semester. I don\u2019t know if I have any motivation for any specific career aspiration, no clear goals. I have been locked up with my non supportive family 24/7 for months now due to Covid lockdowns. I have an ongoing mysterious medical condition for three weeks now, (constant urge to urinate) tests have so far shown nothing and I\u2019m at a crossroads. Been trying to save myself because I\u2019ve always been utterly petrified of ceasing to exist and have been trying to get any med possible and go to every doctor in order to be well again physically but now I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m tired of being used by everyone and supported and genuinely loved by no one. Of suffering from symptoms I can\u2019t get to the bottom of and about which no one cares anyway. I receive no emotional help. I really am a burden so I\u2019ve asked god for whatever he plans to make it quick, whether it\u2019s heal me or kill me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ptmaha/ive_been_fearing_death_all_my_life_but_im_also/", "title": "I\u2019ve been fearing death all my life but I\u2019m also having thoughts about what if death would be a quick escape (not by killing myself, but no longer protesting against my physical illnesses since it would be no big deal if they killed me)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Hopey-Dreamer", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632366598, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ptmaha/ive_been_fearing_death_all_my_life_but_im_also/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429162.4071152, "replies_charged": false}
