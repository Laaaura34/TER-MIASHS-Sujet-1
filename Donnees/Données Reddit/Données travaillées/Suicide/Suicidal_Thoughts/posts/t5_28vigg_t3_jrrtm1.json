But I just feel worthless afterwards. \nI\u2019ve spent the whole day in tears and I just don\u2019t want to be feeling like this anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jrrtm1/i_dont_want_to_be_sad_anymore/", "title": "I don\u2019t want to be sad anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "flyawayhome85", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605037022, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jrrtm1/i_dont_want_to_be_sad_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429254.4601498, "replies_charged": false}
