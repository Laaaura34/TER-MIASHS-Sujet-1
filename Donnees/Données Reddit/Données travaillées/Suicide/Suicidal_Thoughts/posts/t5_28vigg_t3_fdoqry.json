I\u2019ve always been very happy with myself. i mean for all my life i\u2019ve always somewhat gotten okay grades (except for math) and i\u2019ve been happy with the choices i make. lately school has been harsh on me. grades are closing and i\u2019ve 20 missing assignments in math. i have a 42% and i need a 62 to pass so i don\u2019t have to retake it again. i\u2019ve been getting stress and i decide to take it out in eating. i\u2019ve eaten so much in the past few weeks. i gorge me face with chips and sweets and plenty more things. i lay on my bed all day and i\u2019m too of a complete idiot and lazy mess to get up and do my work. i don\u2019t understand it sometimes. i get so mad at myself. i\u2019m overwhelmed and i\u2019m pretty sure i\u2019m going to be over weight as well. i\u2019m going to go get my check up soon and test my blood. i\u2019m so afraid. it\u2019s so humiliating to show up to school wearing baggy clothing to cover up my belly. i\u2019m getting a bigger double chin and i\u2019m getting so self conscious of someone seeing my stomach or seeing my rolls. it\u2019s come to the point where i don\u2019t want to be seen by anyone. i look at my self in the mirror and hate what i see. my teachers are pressuring me to turn in all my work and my mom and dad are yelling at me for having an F in two classes. my mom has been calling my fat or has been hinting at it. it makes me upset because my mom is starting to notice me gaining weight. i thought about killing myself before. plenty of times actually. i even got rope once. i stopped myself because i\u2019m too scared on how it would feel. it\u2019s selfish of me. i want to make it go away so badly. i don\u2019t know how to though. i listen to music and it helps but the thoughts keep coming back. i tell myself to do it. but i hold myself back. i\u2019ve been wanting to cut myself. it\u2019s disgusting what i think of. i\u2019ve been crying more and been wanting to run away. i don\u2019t want to live anymore. it\u2019s becoming so hard to breathe. anyways that\u2019s all i have to say. thanks for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/fdoqry/im_having_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "i\u2019m having suicidal thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "depressedshrimp", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1583377247, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/fdoqry/im_having_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429423.3258426, "replies_charged": false}
