Today I was feeling my temple to see where exactly I\u2019d have to shoot myself to die. But then I thought I\u2019m a strong girl I can go through a less dramatic death. So I got to thinking I should just purposefully get Covid and do everything to make it worse. Just act like I\u2019m fine, no one can visit me. Then boom. One day it gets real bad and I can\u2019t breathe anymore. I have asthma and shit and it\u2019s gotten really bad this year. I already have a lung infection. Spare my family of thinking I killed myself. Maybe it would hurt less for everyone involved.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/k3oj3n/perfect_suicide/", "title": "Perfect suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "vvitchybeepz", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606709603, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/k3oj3n/perfect_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429000.7204912, "replies_charged": false}
