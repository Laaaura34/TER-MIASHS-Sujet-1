I\u2019m still so in love with him but I can tell he doesn\u2019t feel the same anymore and I\u2019m just so lost. I feel like life isn\u2019t worth living anymore it\u2019s just a day to day cycle of feeling so shit. I keep thinking about taking a bunch of pills and falling asleep forever I don\u2019t want to deal with anything anymore. I\u2019m trying to get better but the minute I do it feels like everything is crashing down on me again. The only thing stopping me from doing it is the fear that he\u2019ll think I\u2019m doing it for his attention but I\u2019m just so tired of it all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n0839u/im_so_tired/", "title": "I\u2019m so tired", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tatt00ed_tears", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619589002, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n0839u/im_so_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429124.4700668, "replies_charged": false}
