My life is generally good. I'm making a decent amount of money, I have food, water, electricity, a bed, a roof over my head but anxiety, panic attacks, and depression with work life just makes this life not worth living. \n\nI feel so spoiled and shitty because I have it better than most people but I can't help it. I feel this way. I'm not happy. I live with dread everyday having to worry about work. I feel guilty and anxious everytime I try to rest and relax. There's zero upside in life and unlimited downside. I wish someone more appreciative, hardworking, and deserving could have my life and continue it while letting me die peacefully.\n\n*End thoughts\n\nSo can anyone suggest a painless way to go? Need suggestions specific to my location. I'm in the Philippines.\n\nThanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pk0usl/spoiled_and_suicidal/", "title": "Spoiled and suicidal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Gabe624", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631065217, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pk0usl/spoiled_and_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428725.7620873, "replies_charged": false}
