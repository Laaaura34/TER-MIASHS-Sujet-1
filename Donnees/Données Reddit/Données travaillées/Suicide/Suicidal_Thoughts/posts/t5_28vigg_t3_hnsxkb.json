It's all too much from having to get help for my mental health to weight loss to just a general sense of direction in life. I cant fucking do it by myself because I am broken in so many ways. I dont even have a single friend I cam send this to that wont panic and worry that I'll kill myself. which I suppose is a good thing but I need to talk to someone about this. I told my best friend before covid that I planned on killing myself after our holiday together. They made me promise that I never do it and that I should talk to them when I'm that bad. but I dont want to burden them. I have been suicidal for the last 10years and fucked in the head all my life I just didnt realise it. well that's the disgusting self pity over with.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hnsxkb/i_need_a_reset_life_button/", "title": "I need a reset life button", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Formal-Ad-797", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594254028, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hnsxkb/i_need_a_reset_life_button/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428901.9383764, "replies_charged": false}
