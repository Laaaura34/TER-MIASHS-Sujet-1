I do have suicidal thoughts sometimes. \n\nNamely, fantasies about killing myself in front of my abuser on certain dates in the past where abuse occurred. These thoughts are intrusive and usually follow intrusive memories of the abuse. \n\nRight now, I don't think I consider myself suicidal but these thoughts are making me more depressed. I'm working with my therapist to develop coping skills to avoid ruminating so much but it's hard. \n\nI feel so tired all the time and sometimes I just want to quit my job and spend my days napping. I have passions I want to pursue, but I never feel like I can recover enough energy to do them, which I beat myself up for. And my inner critic basically parrots my abuser so the thoughts start all over again.\n\nSorry to go on.
