But the thing is when I'm cutting I feel like all my pain has left. So when people say don't cut. I look at them stupid and say my body is paper so I'mma cut it. \nPeople always say suicide isn't the answer, but yet no one ever tells us why. The sad part is when u say I don't want you to save me. Let me save my self they are always taking the objects out of your hands. I don't understand why they won't let us save our self. Some times people want to kill themselves because of bullying and sexual herassment, others want to because they where abused. No one knows what you been though but me I'm here to help all of u. I have a friend that is helping me I can help y'all like they are helping me. Please reach out. I love every single one of you guys. If u have discord and u want to Talk leave your username under the post and I'll follow u.\nPeople say your skin isn\u2019t paper so don\u2019t cut it. Then why cut meat it isn\u2019t paper. Your body isn\u2019t yours. Then why you get a tattoo? You just said this body isn\u2019t mine. Well maybe your right. Why suicide is the answer? When u attempt suicide you either feel better or numb. In my case I feel both.  Some people do it just to feel something.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q76mgp/cutting_my_arms/", "title": "Cutting my arms", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "noone126234", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634113176, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q76mgp/cutting_my_arms/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428966.3079264, "replies_charged": false}
