But this is my way of life, it is how I am and how I feel, is there no happiness for someone like me?  I feel condemned to feel everything and always have to clean up the remaining ashes, everything is falling apart and I don't know what else to do.  I can't kill myself, I can't open up to anyone, this pain seems to have no end.  I'm confused and I don't want to hurt anyone, but I feel like destroying everything will do me good, and I know it won't.  I'm tired of this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mrp7jj/tired/", "title": "Tired", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nooneghosthere", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618524054, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mrp7jj/tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429123.1907487, "replies_charged": false}
