Sometimes I just want to drop everything, my responsibilities, my job, everything in front of me. I am honestly tired of taking all the blame. When will this pain stop?\n\nI wanna die but I fear the fact that the money I have saved up isn't even enough for them to buy me a casket hahahaha\n\nI wanna be selfish and just do it\n\nMy friends, I think they won't understand me if I tell them what I feel. What if they say that somebody out there has got it far worse than me? But I promised myself I'll do it before I turn 35. I'm 22 now so I hope it comes faster.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nwp2ab/uh_this_is_my_first_post_idk_what_to_title_it/", "title": "Uh this is my first post idk what to title it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Impossible-Pen988", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623335500, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nwp2ab/uh_this_is_my_first_post_idk_what_to_title_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429292.5526636, "replies_charged": false}
