i have extreme abandonment and attachment issues from my dad which makes me immediately obsessed with anyone who pursues me yet makes me extremely standoffish for fear of abandonment. i cannot be myself in a relationship whatsoever . i just try to come off as perfect as possible so they do not leave. but of course they always end up leaving anyways.\n\ni know what everyone thinks about me. they say i am so beautiful and i always have so many men interested in me and i should easily be able to get a boyfriend but i cannot keep a man. they truly see me as this whore that sleeps around and needs a lot of attention and validation from a lot of men. but that is so far from the truth. the fact is that i cannot keep a man interested in me for more than a few months and i don\u2019t know why. there is nothing more that i want in this life than to truly fall in love and experience true love. i know i have so much to give and one of my strongest traits is loyalty. but i am just so scared & feel that it simply is just not in the cards for me to ever experience love because i am so afraid of it. i grew up believing that all men cheat and treat women like shit. my maternal grandmother vented to me every day as a child about her failed marriage and how my grandpa treated her and cheated on her relentlessly. i don\u2019t even know my grandpa on my dads side but i do know that he had several affairs and whole other families with other women while married to my grandmother. and obviously my dad left at 7 and never contacted me again. this made me feel rejected and scared of men growing up. in 4th grade i convinced myself that my dad left because i was fat. i had absolutely no example of a decent man in my life. on top of that i was ignored and bullied by men growing up because i was ugly and overweight. until i was 16 and was considered \u201ccurvy\u201d and beautiful. i only know how to be sexualized by men and used for my body.\n\nanyways i know this turned into me venting about my relationship issues. but i\u2019m guessing this is where the suicidal thoughts are coming from. i don\u2019t know who to vent to or who to tell and i\u2019m scared that i\u2019m going to do something bad to hurt myself. it\u2019s been 8 years since i last attempted but it terrifies me that i know i have it in me to try again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o77d2i/not_depressed_but_id_be_fine_with_dying/", "title": "not depressed but i\u2019d be fine with dying", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cherryariesxo", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624560691, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o77d2i/not_depressed_but_id_be_fine_with_dying/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428826.8286402, "replies_charged": false}
