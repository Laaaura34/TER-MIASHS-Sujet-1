I\u2019m one of those people who never planned for the future because I thought I\u2019d just kill myself after hs, then college, and now I\u2019m where I am today. But because of a bad mental breakdown my senior year of college I gave up on what I wanted to do in life. My life isn\u2019t TERRIBLE but it\u2019s still worse than where I wanted to be.\n\nThe other night I took some shrooms, which usually make me think about things, and I started reflecting on my life choices and realizing I screwed up everything. I\u2019ve never HAD a worse panic attack than I did in that moment, I was so upset with everything. I was crying, hyperventilating to the point where I couldn\u2019t breathe, having so many negative racing thoughts through my head. I had such a bad headache that lasted well into the next day and it felt like my brain was getting ripped in half between all the negative thoughts and the half of me that knew I shouldn\u2019t listen to them.\n\nObviously the shrooms were a big push into this attack, but had I not taken them idk if I would\u2019ve ever tried to get my life back on track. I\u2019ve still felt really depressed and stressed for the past 2 days, but then today happened.\n\nI went to the laundry mat. One person took up all of the fast machines and chose not to start them until I was about to use them. Then one of their washing machines broke down and the door wouldn\u2019t unlock to get their clothes out. Then one of the dryers they tried to use ate up a ton of their quarters. I ended up being done and out of there before that load in their washing machine even got taken out.\n\nI walked all over town for errands. Had to use about 7 crosswalks and every single time I\u2019d hit the button I\u2019d immediately get the right of way to walk.\n\nThen something I needed from Walmart for weeks that\u2019s been out of stock was finally restocked, I didn\u2019t even PLAN on going into Walmart, I just went because I had an errand to run in the same area.\n\nNow it\u2019s worth mentioning that I\u2019m Wiccan. I thought the whole laundry thing was just \u201crule of thirds\u201d aka, kinda like karma. But then all the other things happened and I got to thinking why everything is going so well for me today. Then I thought maybe it was the universe telling me not to kill myself:\n\nLaundry? \u201cYour situation could\u2019ve been worse.\u201d\nAll the crosswalks changing as soon as I hit the button EVERY time? \u201cDon\u2019t *stop* your life, change is coming.\u201d\nWalmart finally having the one thing I\u2019ve needed for months? \u201cThings will work out, just be patient and don\u2019t lose hope.\u201d\n\nOf course I know damn well these were all complete coincidences, but the witch in me just can\u2019t chalk it up to that. And if it helps me a tiny bit about how down I\u2019ve been feeling lately, does it really matter if they *were* just coincidences??", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pfc6bm/some_strange_coincidences_after_i_had_a_complete/", "title": "Some strange coincidences after I had a complete existential crisis\u2026", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Throwaway_bae420", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630435737, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pfc6bm/some_strange_coincidences_after_i_had_a_complete/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428974.7523715, "replies_charged": false}
