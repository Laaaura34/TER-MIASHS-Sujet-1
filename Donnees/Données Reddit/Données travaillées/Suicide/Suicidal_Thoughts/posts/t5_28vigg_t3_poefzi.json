If I was ok since I was about to cry in class? No. Did someone  me punching the bathroom wall today? Probably. Did I just spend an hour making a list of how much I will SH if I do certain behaviors? You bet I did. Did I tet my ex who literally doesn't give a shit about me, because I'm lonely? Yep and no reply. Am I hoping to lose 10lbs by this weekend and will I actually do it? Yes and probably, does that concern me? I don't even know at this point. Am I fucking exhausted and so lonely I wanna die? Yepperz. Being me is soooo fun, but im the only one I have and even tho I keep fucking everything up I'm still the only one I trust, the only one who has my back. Has basically everyone abandoned me this year? Yes, did I push them away? Most of them yes. Do I regret this? Absolutely, am I doing anything to not continue with the couple people i have left? Not really. Am I barely 2 weeks clean from cutting? Yep and thats probably gonna be a big fat 0 soon....", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/poefzi/i_walked_in_front_of_moving_traffic_today/", "title": "I walked in front of moving traffic today", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KAI_IS_FINE", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631662819, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/poefzi/i_walked_in_front_of_moving_traffic_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429067.0983934, "replies_charged": false}
