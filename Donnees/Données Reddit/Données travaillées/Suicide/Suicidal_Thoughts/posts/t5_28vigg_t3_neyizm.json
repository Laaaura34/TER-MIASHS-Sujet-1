I usually write on my notes when I\u2019m feeling extremely depressed & suicidal but sometimes I go to Reddit & it cheers me up a bit. I know I\u2019m not alone because many other people are also feeling the same way I do in this community. a second ago I really wanted to just end it all.. I\u2019m extremely tired. I\u2019m thankful for my family & my best friend but I\u2019m just so tired. I\u2019ve been depressed for many years but the suicidal thoughts started to get worse these past 2 years. this year took a major toll on me and I\u2019m not sure how much longer I should keep going. during March, I set a date on when I should end it all. every-time I set a date to kill myself, I end up backing out but not because I\u2019m afraid, its because I get distracted and I keep pushing the date further & further away. I keep having thoughts tho to just end it all right now. I used to want to go to therapy but at this point of my life I feel that it\u2019s worthless. one side of me wants to keep pushing to live my life & do new things while another part of me would rather be dead. my heart hurts so much. I really don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep pushing myself. I am constantly distracting myself every single day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/neyizm/tired/", "title": "tired", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "shortcakeblucky", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621304027, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/neyizm/tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428997.7706792, "replies_charged": false}
