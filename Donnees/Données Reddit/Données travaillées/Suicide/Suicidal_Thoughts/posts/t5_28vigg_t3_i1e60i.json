I'm listening through my Spotify playlist and all of the sudden I get super sad and my mind goes blank, except some suicidal thoughts that go through my head.\n\nSometimes I just start crying as well. It also happens during songs that are obviously depressing. Most of the time it happens during One More Light by Linkin Park. I always think that I'm just stupid, because it feels like I'm being like one of those emo teenagers that listen to depressing songs all day. Thing is, I really like the song, and all the other songs, but I don't know if I should just stop listening to them.\n\n\\[Sorry if most of these sentences don't make much sense, I just don't know how to say all of this. Plus, English isn't my mother language, so.. yeah.\\]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/i1e60i/is_it_weird_that_some_songs_trigger_suicidal/", "title": "Is it weird that some songs trigger suicidal thoughts in me?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Neox12345", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596224753, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/i1e60i/is_it_weird_that_some_songs_trigger_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429418.9660237, "replies_charged": false}
