I don\u2019t want to hurt them as we\u2019ve had a recent suicide and I\u2019ve been able to see and experience first hand what it does to those close to you. But I don\u2019t want to be here. Even when I\u2019m not like sad or feeling in a depressive mood. I just don\u2019t really want to be here. Even when I\u2019m happy I feel like it would be easier. I let people down and my head always hurts and I can\u2019t stop it hurting and I can\u2019t stop it thinking and I can\u2019t stop it and I don\u2019t know what to do. I have reasons to get out of bed but I never see them as reasons to get out of bed and I just wish I could pass away in my sleep peacefully and the people around me be happy and content but that can\u2019t happen and I don\u2019t know what to do or what to say or what to think.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hxrtzz/idk_what_to_title_this/", "title": "Idk what to title this", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Tiaand98", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595702593, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hxrtzz/idk_what_to_title_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429480.7452435, "replies_charged": false}
