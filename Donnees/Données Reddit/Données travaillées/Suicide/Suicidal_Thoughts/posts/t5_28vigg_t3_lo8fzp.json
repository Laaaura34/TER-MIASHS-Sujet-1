I\u2019m scared of the thoughts that I have. every death I see im jealous I wish I were them no matter how painful their death was. some times I see people and I want to beat the fuck out of them, I see and hear things, things that would fuck people up. And lately, I have been talking to myself a lot\u00a0\n\n\nI'm a psychopath, that or i'm going insane\u00a0\n\n\nBut eh who cares, not a single person gives a fuck even if they say they do. People are selfish beings who only want the best for themselves and everyone just wants to procreate. Why?\u00a0 Because it feels good. I don\u2019t even know why I'm talking about this. But I do not feel this way. I don\u2019t want kids to have the same thoughts as I do. I haven\u2019t felt love all I\u2019ve been doing is holding back. And is not like anyone loves or ever will love me anyway so who cares, I don\u2019t know why I even try anymore.\u00a0\n\n\nAnyway, I'm a failure at everything I do. I can\u2019t even end my life properly, I cant pull a trigger, I can't jump nor starve, and can't take enough pills.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know who I am\n\n\u00a0I cannot live up to the expectations anymore, I was an honor student but what is the fucking point I won\u2019t live past high school. I don\u2019t give a fuck about what you guys tell me. And I know I don\u2019t belong anywhere. I don\u2019t know why you guys hang out with me. If I were you I would have forgotten about myself already, hell I\u2019ve done that myself. I don\u2019t know what I like or what I want. I only know that I have one thing really and that a tattoo but I'm probably not going to get one.\u00a0\n\n\nDid you know that I'm on several watchlists for committing fraud, visiting black market websites, and finally for making computer viruses for money? And if I do anything wrong I'm gone without a doubt whether from myself or not.\n\nNot only that but, I have stolen 2 documents from the cia so that's a thing, ask me if you want me to show you.\u00a0\n\n\nGod damn this white background is fucking with my eyes.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI feel like the black body theory, in physics, a surface that absorbs all radiant energy falling on it. The term arises because incident visible light will be absorbed rather than reflected, and therefore the surface will appear black. It\u2019s something that absorbs light and happiness and turns it into darkness, to nothing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nI lack massive amounts of serotonin, I wish that I had it but so does everyone else. I wish that I had a normal happy life, a happy family. But as I said before I can\u2019t bring myself to passing off my genes, my thoughts, and feelings. Also, it\u2019s not like i'll live long enough to be able to pass them on.\u00a0\n\n\nI wish I had my own workshop to build things, to be left alone the hermit within me wants me to crawl into a hole and die there alone. I think i'll do that.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lo8fzp/whats_so_great_about_life/", "title": "what's so great about life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DEAMON24", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613832067, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lo8fzp/whats_so_great_about_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429357.4576786, "replies_charged": false}
