I've looked for ways to kill myself and I think pills would be \"easiest.\" What pills can I take? Especially ones like common house items because I can't buy any. Or maybe how can I cut myself? I've never cut myself for self harm so I really have no idea how to do it but if someone explains it good enough I can try to maybe do a mix of both. Please. If you understood the reasons you may be upset that this is the solution but you'd know. My future can't be anymore. DM if necessary. Thank you very much.
