I\u2019ve been sleeping in this guys shed for a week. Jess still takes me in but her parents kick me out again. I long for the time I have money so I can get high and forget my sadness for I while. Yesterday, Luke blew his brain matter all over me and left me with more battle scars. I guess he finally gave in. Every day I go out and look for another bitch to impregnate, or \u201cfriend\u201d to fuck over, or person to rob. It just repeats itself every fucking day. What am I doing with my life? The world seems to just pass by without noticing my suffering. I\u2019ve already lost my section8. I can\u2019t wait for the day I stop being a pussy and end my suffering. Im fucking worthless. I\u2019m a burden to Jess, I was a burden to Luke, and I\u2019m also a burden to society. I think tomorrow is my day. I\u2019m going to walk into the mall and project my anger. I plan on killing at least 6 people and maybe more. Then I\u2019ll finally be free. I don\u2019t expect anyone to read this, but if you did you probably still don\u2019t give a fuck so what\u2019s the point.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lf9dvg/the_world_passes_i_hope_i_do/", "title": "The world passes, I hope I do.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "0100011001001101", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612781534, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lf9dvg/the_world_passes_i_hope_i_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429295.521796, "replies_charged": false}
