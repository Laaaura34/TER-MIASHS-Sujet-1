But my thoughts just keep getting worst and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I\u2019ve been in a lock down facility for 2 years due to my suicidal ideation and that didn\u2019t help, I\u2019ve had the best therapist and support system and it just isn\u2019t enough. I could have the best day and still at the end of the night my thoughts are \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be here anymore\u201d. At this point I just don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019m tired, I recently started S/H again after not doing so for almost a year. Now that I started I see no reason to stop, I have no reason to stop, when I do it I\u2019m not doing it on my wrist so there\u2019s no way to actually die for it but it just helps me cope with how I\u2019m feeling. I\u2019m tired and Idk what to do anymore, any advice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pbsjmj/im_just_tired/", "title": "I\u2019m just tired\u2026.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "applexslut", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629953514, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pbsjmj/im_just_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429105.4716716, "replies_charged": false}
