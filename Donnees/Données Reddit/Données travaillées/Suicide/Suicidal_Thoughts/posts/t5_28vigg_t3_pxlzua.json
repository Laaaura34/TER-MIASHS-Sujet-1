I know it takes work and I know you have to constantly work at it, and I don\u2019t want to. I go through periods of \u201cI\u2019m going to change my mindset!\u201d and try to make those decisions that will enhance my life but I end up just kind of wanting to die all the time anyway. It feels inescapable and I don\u2019t feel like fighting it anymore. I can\u2019t handle any minor stressors and all I do all day is ruminate in my anxieties and negative thoughts. No matter how much I tell myself what I\u2019m thinking isn\u2019t true and it\u2019s just a pattern I\u2019ve gotten myself into, I still can\u2019t help but reason that these thoughts aren\u2019t coming from nowhere and maybe they do have validity if they\u2019ve been occurring for the better part of the last ten years. I fantasize about just not having to deal with life. I have grown a rather strong hatred towards school which sucks because I always dreamed of going to a great college and now that I\u2019m here I can\u2019t stand it and I can\u2019t really blame anyone but myself. I don\u2019t flourish socially and I struggle so much academically. Even though I consistently get good grades the work makes me feel so incapable, frustrated and overwhelmed I cry most days just trying to get through it and when I\u2019m not crying and trying to get it done, I\u2019m just thinking about all the fucking work I have to do that I know will cause me panic. I don\u2019t enjoy classes because I\u2019m so concerned about being smart and coming off good to my teachers and peers. I really don\u2019t like waking up everyday just to repeat the same shit. I don\u2019t see a future for myself at all. I can\u2019t even get through school and I know that isn\u2019t the only way to be successful but it is decently important when I don\u2019t have anything else going for me. I fantasize about not having to think about these things, not having to deal with a future and not being burdened by your own thoughts because well, in my fantasy I\u2019m dead. It\u2019s just a nothingness. I\u2019d much rather choose that than this. It feels like I\u2019m just passing time and I\u2019d rather not put myself through that.\n\nI think about suicide everyday lately. It isn\u2019t always consistent, but the depression is and has been for at least the last three years. I know it can go away and I can be happy but I just don\u2019t care to try and make that a reality for myself. I am skeptical it\u2019s even possible for me and part of me knows that this part of me just won\u2019t die. So I wish I could kill myself but just as I suck at living, I feel like I suck at dying, or at least committing to it. I guess I\u2019m afraid of the pain I\u2019ll feel before dying. I also know it would be the problem of people around me. There\u2019s so many reasons for wanting to die and reasons for not doing it. So I feel like I\u2019m just trudging along barely making it through sometimes. And most days I wish I could just commit and make it end. There\u2019s such an overwhelming feeling of being trapped and helpless and I even keep a bottle of pills on me in case I do decide to really go through with it. It seems like there\u2019s no good help and I\u2019m so fucking sick of trying to make shit that makes me miserable somehow less awful but saying affirmations in the mirror and journaling. I\u2019m sick of being in this world and I\u2019m sick of not being willing enough to take myself out from it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pxlzua/i_suck_at_living/", "title": "I suck at living", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "okaypenz", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632883017, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pxlzua/i_suck_at_living/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428844.4431295, "replies_charged": false}
