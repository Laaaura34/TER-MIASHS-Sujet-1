Really, I came here so people finally would but I'm still as useless as I was half an hour ago. I'm about to start packing my shit because I'm staying at a mates house and his brother started mocking me so I beat his head in till he was unconscious. I'm a terrible friend. Why am I such a loser? I try to talk to people but a panic amd say something I regret. I just lost my rock because of my stupid self saying lol after she told me she had to get her cat put down. Why am i like this? I'm just too fucking stupid. I'd be better off dead. I think I'll head to the home my useless ass grew up in and od. Fucj this. If you're reading this don't think about me after reading this.
