Two years ago I started seeking help after a failed suicide attempt. I'm on quite heavy meds and therapy, but i've allways tried to apear as normal as can be. I listen to other peoples petty problems, put myself aside all the time and never persue anything.\n  \nIn september 2020 I came out about my problems to some friends and my employer, because I was nearing the point of no return once more. October 27th came that point, was ready to get out, but my fianc\u00e9 busted me and stopped me. I was incarcerated, upping my meds and therapy. I thought I was doing better for a while, then my godfather died, I got to say goodbye but he did not recognise me. I really looked up to him so this struck me really hard. This lead to a premature incarceration, to avoid any attempts, which was for the best looking back. They started performing EMDR therapy wich is straight up torture, sent me hurling into panick multiple times.\n  \nRecently started working again, thinking I was better. But I can't help but notice that there still is a su\u00efcide wish. I feel numb, and I don't know if that means i've beaten my depression or stopped caring. I still wish to end it all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nq094g/not_sure_if_i_have_beaten_my_depression_or_just/", "title": "Not sure if I have beaten my depression, or just stopped caring", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Darth_Skullcrush", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622570499, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nq094g/not_sure_if_i_have_beaten_my_depression_or_just/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428825.812002, "replies_charged": false}
