They either always avoid me or they try to lecture me and stuff, some even bullied me for not pulling the trigger. At first I didn't think much of it, but now almost all my friends and family have turned their backs to me and I have no one to talk to. I just want to know if I'm valid. I don't understand why people always have to act like that.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hy600n/everyone_i_meet_and_tell_stuff_about_myself_acts/", "title": "Everyone I meet and tell stuff about myself acts toxic towards me.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Stopeatingmyravioli", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595766009, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hy600n/everyone_i_meet_and_tell_stuff_about_myself_acts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429630.374305, "replies_charged": false}
