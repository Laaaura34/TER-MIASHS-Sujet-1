The pandemic has drained the life out of the best souls.  There is someone who will miss you.  Someone who will be haunted because they could not stop you or even know.  Many geniuses are suicidal.  They feel so much and this is a hard world in a horrible time.  Please don\u2019t do anything without a lot of rest, a walk in nature, holding a baby pup or kitten, or drinking something delicious.  My friend is in stage 4 brain cancer and she wants to live!  I want you to live because depression is also a disease we must fight.  I had a stroke after the birth of my twins and then seizures.  It robbed me of serotonin and I was afraid to get help.  But I realized that much of mental health is chemical.  You may need help to fix it.  Please keep living because I know someone will never be the same without you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ndfz2w/dont_die/", "title": "Don\u2019t die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AdSubject4824", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621137645, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ndfz2w/dont_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428922.064496, "replies_charged": false}
