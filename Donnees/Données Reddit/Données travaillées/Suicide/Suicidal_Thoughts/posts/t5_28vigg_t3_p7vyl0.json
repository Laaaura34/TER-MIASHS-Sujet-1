I get the urge to take 4 of my Klonopin and smoke and drink until I\u2019m completely trashed and go out and party and hide the pain and dance and another or do the same combo of drugs and cut myself and scream and cry. Sometimes I can\u2019t fathom what I could be capable of if the people I loved weren\u2019t there for me. I\u2019m an uptight, cynical, washed up whore who can\u2019t function in society and barely do what I do now because my depression has gotten so bad but not so bad that people notice. But they will and I don\u2019t want them to, I much prefer to hide the pain tbh. I really want to work, cut myself, take drugs, drink, smoke, or go drink at a show until I get alcohol poisoning I don\u2019t know.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p7vyl0/i_feel_like_i_dont_know_if_i_should_kill_myself/", "title": "I feel like I don\u2019t know if I should kill myself or hide from the world until I feel safe again.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "vide0vixen", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629437801, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p7vyl0/i_feel_like_i_dont_know_if_i_should_kill_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429404.5037923, "replies_charged": false}
