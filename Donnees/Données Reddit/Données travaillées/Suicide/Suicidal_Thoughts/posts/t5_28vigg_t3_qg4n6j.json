No trust. \n\nNow I'm nobody, now that the vaccine passpost thing has gone hardcore in Europe. I'm at fault that the plague is goin round. I'm at fault there aren't enough doctors. I'm at fault I don't dare to take the damn vaccine, and I will lose everything because of that decision. \n\nI'm trying to talk myself into it, trying to find a reason to swallow all the insults, to obey and to conform, and I can't. And I'm afraid of the consequences. It might be I'll lose my disability allowance because of it. \n\nThen I'll either steal and hustle until I get caught, or until I die. The clock's tickin away. You hear it, you hear them comin up the stairs, armed and ready to go? I do. \n\nThe winter is coming. Until spring, us without the passpost are increasingly left without jobs, without medical aid, without compassion, nevermind the libraries and gyms we can't go to. We are stupid and need to be protected from ourselves. We do not deserve the air we breathe. We are at fault the old people suffocate. It's our fault childrens hospitals need to beg donations to get equipment - and that has been the reality for 30 years now. All. Our. Fault.\n\nFuck\n\nI'm sorry", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qg4n6j/stupid/", "title": "Stupid", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "xxblackbeak", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635248882, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qg4n6j/stupid/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428883.6758378, "replies_charged": false}
