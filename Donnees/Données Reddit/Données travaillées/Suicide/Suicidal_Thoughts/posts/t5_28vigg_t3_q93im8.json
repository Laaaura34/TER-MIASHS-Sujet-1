Instead articles popped up with cliches like \u201cdon\u2019t give up hope.\u201d Or \u201cyou don\u2019t want to die you just want the pain to end\u201d like no I want to die hence how I\u2019m at this point.\n\nHow do you explain to people that you feel like your existence is worthless and every day reaffirms how much nobody cares. I don\u2019t even reach out for help because nobody knows how to react when you say you want to kill yourself. At this point I feel like my options are either to do it or just keep holding things in. Literally nobody cares about us until we\u2019re dead and then they eventually forget about you anyway. Everyday I make a pros and cons list in my head.\n\nThe sad thing is that I know there\u2019s life to love. I know my cats would know I\u2019m gone. My husband would be devastated. Old classmates and coworkers would feel sad when they find out. They\u2019ll feel bad after but didn\u2019t care enough to do anything while I was here. I just want to talk about my depression without consequences or indifference.
