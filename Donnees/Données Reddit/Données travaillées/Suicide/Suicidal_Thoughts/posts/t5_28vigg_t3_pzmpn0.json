New semester fucked me up, everyone else in my major/university are so fucking smart\n\nand my role there is just being a fucking clown dickhead whining about own life. My parents must feel\n\nridiculous about me, they invested huge on me for my life for my university life in foreign country and\n\nI messed it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCutting myself also feels stupid now, never improve anything in studying or mental stability.\n\nPeople say it's alright to be like that sometimes, but is it actually alright?
