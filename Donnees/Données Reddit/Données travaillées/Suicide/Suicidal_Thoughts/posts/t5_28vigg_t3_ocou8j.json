I have tried everything that comes to mind: hotlines, Googleing, reddit and my close friends. But most effective thing so far that has prevented me from killing myself was how bad I am at killing myself. This is sad and panicking. We have no good options, just last minute helps from volunteers. I really tried to help many of these people but there aren't many of us. Anyways Im drunk and don't know how to write shit rn, too busy failing to kill myself;(", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ocou8j/from_my_experience_suicidal_prevention_is_useless/", "title": "From my experience suicidal prevention is useless", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "loveofmoonandstar", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625278108, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ocou8j/from_my_experience_suicidal_prevention_is_useless/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428738.4657884, "replies_charged": false}
