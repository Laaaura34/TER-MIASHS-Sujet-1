There were demons in the dark and they were surrounding me. In my hands I had daggers (It was actually one dagger and a dildo). I gave my battlecry and goaded them to fight me. It was then I felt a forceful wave knock me into the air and through the windows. I saw everything fade away and get smaller as I began to fall into the darkness. Anxiety overcame me as I awaited the ground.. But the ground never came. And I have been falling since :(", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q4josu/falling_and_never_hitting_the_ground/", "title": "falling and never hitting the ground;", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mesa_b0t", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633779859, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q4josu/falling_and_never_hitting_the_ground/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429215.2521608, "replies_charged": false}
