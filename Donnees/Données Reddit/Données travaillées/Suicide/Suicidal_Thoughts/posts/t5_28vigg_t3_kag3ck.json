Like normal emotions. I do feel happy sometimes, sad , lonely, and all that. I feel normal stuff, but at the same time I also know I\u2019m different. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of my past, my mental health, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s from things I\u2019ve seen and witnessed because I know that I do have at least a little ptsd  from some of the things I\u2019ve been through and seen, but I don\u2019t care because it\u2019s made me more in touch with reality. I don\u2019t know exactly why, but it started about when I was 12, I changed. I started seeing life and reality how it really is, I started thinking abt things and feeling stuff I never did before. The only feeling I can give to describe myself is physchedelic. It doesn\u2019t make sense to everyone but to me it does. It\u2019s just every minute of my life I feel like I\u2019m on a rollercoaster, a never ending rollercoaster of happiness and sadness that just loops around me forever and never ends, I feel like I\u2019m always high I don\u2019t know why. It doesn\u2019t make sense but that is really how I feel all the time. I just always feel like there is something different running through my veins. I don\u2019t know why. But I know I\u2019m different than most people, and I\u2019m not crazy, I just am very much more self aware than most people are. It\u2019s good and bad. I am intelligent with most things too, I can be good at school but I feel like it\u2019s a waste of time and mind. I realistically won\u2019t use any of it, because I\u2019m not like everyone else.  I always just feel like I\u2019m the only real person and everyone else is just all the same. I\u2019ve never met anyone different like me. I can\u2019t hold a relationship because of how hectic my life and mind are. I never want to put people through that because I always think I don\u2019t wanna take someone on this mind ride with me it\u2019s my own situation. That\u2019s why I try not to make friends or get in relationships because I don\u2019t wanna put people through me.I always feel sad, and I lash out at people sometimes, I don\u2019t mean too, it\u2019s just I try so hard sometimes to get people to understand me and my mind, but of course, nobody ever will. And that is okay with me. I used to be toxic, because I was just as confused about what I was doing and why I was the way I was as everyone else used to be. But I\u2019m okay now, I don\u2019t lash out, I\u2019m calmer now. It\u2019s like whenever you cut yourself, it hurts at first, and it\u2019s intense and you feel adrenaline, but after a certain limit of pain you just stop feeling, almost like the brain doesn\u2019t know how to cope with that severity of feeling or pain. That\u2019s how I am, I thought I was going crazy, I was sad all the time, I was scared, I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do next, but now I am calmer, I can control it , and now I don\u2019t freak out or get scared, I just feel numb. Also I\u2019m always nice to people, I always try to make sure everyone is okay and happy, because honestly nobody ever does for me and I\u2019m always lonely, so I try to make sure other people don\u2019t have to go through that so I\u2019m always happy to people. This is also why I like slowed down music, because my mind is constantly spinning and listening to slow music gives me a chance to slow down and sync with everyone else. This stuff sounds stupid to whoever may ever read this but all this stuff just explains me and how I am. I just feel like every time I close my eyes I\u2019m so high in the sky, alone on a burning rollercoaster going all day long, constantly. It\u2019s fun but can also be stressful at times. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m going crazy, but I know I\u2019m not, my mind is just very hectic and sometimes it\u2019s a lot to handle so I feel like I lose a grip on myself sometimes and go off the rails, but I always get back somehow. I used to actually think I was possessed or something \ud83d\ude02but now I know it\u2019s just my mind. I\u2019m just a very outlandish person, no other way to describe it. I\u2019ve done bad things, things I won\u2019t say on this note, but I\u2019ve been through some stuff that nobody knows about, and nobody except for me will ever know about some things that I\u2019ve done. That\u2019s okay with me, because I try my best to make people see that I\u2019m positive, and I try to act happy to everyone, so my real feelings and the things I\u2019ve done will all die with me and that\u2019s fine with me. It\u2019s hard for me to connect with people, because I\u2019m not like them, and then I just give up. That\u2019s why I stopped talking to almost everyone I used too. To many people to handle and I like being alone. It\u2019s a lot to handle sometimes, that\u2019s why I tried to kill myself so many times and was depressed because I just couldn\u2019t handle my mind anymore, but I\u2019ve learned too. I was going through a lot, lost one of my girlfriends that actually understood me, but she committed suicide because she wasn\u2019t well at home. I lost friends, I\u2019ve lost so many things. But I always remember as long as I\u2019m still sitting in my mental rollercoaster alone, I don\u2019t need people sitting around me in my life. It\u2019s more peaceful alone for me. More enjoyable honestly. I love my family, but a mind like me needs a lot of alone time. Nobody really understand me or gets what I feel. I don\u2019t blame them, it doesn\u2019t make sense if you aren\u2019t living through it. Me and Olivia my little sister are the most similar because i am the way I am and she is more of an introvert, like me. But we didn\u2019t talk for years because I think we thought we hated each other but we really just didn\u2019t talk. I love Sophia my twin sister but she is just a toxic person. I love my mom but she will never understand my Mind, and that\u2019s okay. My dad won\u2019t understand either but they both try, and it means a lot, but I wish they wouldn\u2019t because it\u2019s a waste of time. I don\u2019t need help, I just live a different lifestyle than everyone else, and I always will. I will always do crazy pshychedelic things that won\u2019t make sense to most people. Parking a car at the top of a hill and doing acid at night while it\u2019s windy and cold and listening to music then staying at a carnival or party all night long and blasting music and doing drugs to numb myself doesn\u2019t sound normal,but I do that regularly ,but I feel like things like that are the only things that calm me down and bring me back to reality. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve always had a love for rollercoasters and amusement parks, and the whole amusement park/ carnival aesthetic in general. I just feel like because my head is always spinning and on a trip, when I\u2019m on a rollercoaster it\u2019s almost like I catch up to my own mind for a second. I\u2019m in sync with myself while I am on a rollercoaster because of all the spinning and flipping and turning, rollercoasters are hectic and instense similar to the way it feels for me with my mind all the time, so it balances out. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve always said if anyone ever had to live in my mind for just a day, they would probably drive themselves crazy or kill themselves, because it\u2019s scary sometimes feeling this intense. Not for me, but at first I was scared which is why I tried to kill myself so many times. The only real reason that I haven\u2019t killed myself is because of Michael my little brother. Can\u2019t do that to him, I should have done it when he was younger so he wouldn\u2019t even remember me, but now he\u2019s older and smarter and he remembers me and he loves me, so he wouldn\u2019t understand if I just disappeared from his life one day, and I just can\u2019t bring myself to leave his life like that. Not everyone can handle feeling like this, it\u2019s hard for me sometimes too and if I had to choose to be like this or normal, I would choose this though. It\u2019s a trip. if anyone ever sees this, I know it sounds crazy, but trust me Im ok. I\u2019ve learned to deal with it and I\u2019ve accepted that I will probably always feel this way mentally. That\u2019s fine with me. I can be normal, I\u2019m mature, I\u2019m smart, I\u2019m funny, it\u2019s just this that I keep to myself. It\u2019s Thursday October 22nd , my name is Ethan starr.
