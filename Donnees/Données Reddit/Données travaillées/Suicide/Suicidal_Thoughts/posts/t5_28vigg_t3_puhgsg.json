Plus cross-country is going to be shut down, which is the only other part of school I like. And if that isn't bad enough, my love interest is questioning their feelings for me, and they're the one thing that's brought me the most happiness in the last many months.

And for those who might give me any \"but God is just testing you\", I don't want to hear it, I'm an atheist. Anyway I just don't know what to do, I can't go on.
