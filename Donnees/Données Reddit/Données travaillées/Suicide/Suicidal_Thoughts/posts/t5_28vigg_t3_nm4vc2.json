Instead I\u2019m constantly letting everyone down and whenever I\u2019m not letting people down, my mind tells me that I\u2019m doing something wrong which puts me in a shit mental state. I feel like I\u2019m constantly drifting away from society and my friend groups even though we talk daily. I can\u2019t hold a simple 30 second conversation with anyone without feeling like I\u2019m doing something wrong or boring them.\nI wish I could find a way out without effecting anyone but I feel like that\u2019s selfish of me to do so instead I sit in my room playing games to get the little bits of enjoyment from them. And whenever my friends decide to head off to go to bed or do something else I can\u2019t help but feel shitty and start feeling like I\u2019m not good enough. I just feel lonely constantly, even when I\u2019m talking to a friend. I always feel selfish when considering asking for help because I\u2019m not worth anybody\u2019s time and my friends all have coping mechanisms for their down times, I\u2019ve overused my mechanism by playing on my game too much, I can\u2019t get any fun out of it anymore, going back to games I\u2019ve enjoyed in the past to try and ignite the spark they once had but it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nMy brain says 1 thing whilst my heart says another. My brain tells me I\u2019m useless whilst my heart tells me I\u2019m trying my best. I fear failure and judgement and my fear of failure just manifests the failure to happen.\n\nI just want to disappear or cease to exist.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nm4vc2/i_just_want_to_stop_existing/", "title": "I just want to stop existing", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Burdett1878", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622113196, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nm4vc2/i_just_want_to_stop_existing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429344.524651, "replies_charged": false}
