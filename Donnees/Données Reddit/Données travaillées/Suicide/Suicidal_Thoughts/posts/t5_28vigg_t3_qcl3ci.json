From the time I was about 10 is when I have my first memories of conversations leading up to \u201cyou\u2019ll never be good enough\u201d. It was always over dumb things that to this day I wonder why they mattered. \n\nDue to their inability to care for themselves anymore, I still decided to put my life on hold about 2 years ago, and left my life as a single bachelor to come back and care for them as they\u2019re older and I just assumed they\u2019d respect me as an adult. Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case. Every single day is arguments. It\u2019s like I\u2019m back in high school. \n\nToday was the day that broke the camels back. \n\nDue to a car accident about a month ago, I sustained life threatening injuries that prevent me from leaving the house. I\u2019ve lost my career because of it, however I had an interview today to work from home. It didn\u2019t go well. While they were cool enough to do the interview through tele-chat, it wasn\u2019t even close to enough, and quite honestly the whole thing just depressed me as I really thought this would be the one good thing to happen for me in the last 2 years.\n\nIn the process of my interview I sat outside for it, leaving my mother to do whatever it was she felt the need to do throughout the house, which apparently included the breaking of my one of a kind, signed guitar, that I received from the guitarist who kept me alive during my childhood. I wasn\u2019t met with an apology. Instead, I was met with \u201cit\u2019s not my fault\u201d \u201cit\u2019s time to get rid of that thing anyway\u201d and a whole bunch of other shit that just wasn\u2019t ok. \n\nI know it seems as if I\u2019m complaining and overreacting, but the rest of the stupid things that just piled up over the last 36 years have me in bed at 2am with a multitude of options staring me in the face. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold out. \n\nTherapy hasn\u2019t worked, I\u2019ve begged them to come with me, to no avail, I can\u2019t afford to get them health aids by myself, ESPECIALLY now and my brothers won\u2019t help me.\n\nI don\u2019t know what else to do. \n\nI think I\u2019ve reached my breaking point, and feel like the world would be better off without me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qcl3ci/i_think_ive_reached_my_breaking_point/", "title": "I think I\u2019ve reached my breaking point\u2026", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "musicalchef1985", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634796395, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qcl3ci/i_think_ive_reached_my_breaking_point/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428840.24576, "replies_charged": false}
