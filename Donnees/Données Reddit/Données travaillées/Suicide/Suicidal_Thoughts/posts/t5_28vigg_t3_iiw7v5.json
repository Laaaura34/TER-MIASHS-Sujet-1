By 10:39 this morning, I killed myself 13 times, in 13 different ways\u2026 in my head.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what it was or what exactly led up to me breaking but I did.\u00a0 As I laid on my bed, I had a euphoric feeling and felt like I was floating above myself watching.\u00a0 My brain and my body were urging me to walk into the garage, get my 12 gauge and finish myself off.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if it was my soul or my heart that was stopping me from doing it but it made my body physically hurt as I fought the urge to stand up and go\u2026.\u00a0 I begged my son to lay with me and hold me.\u00a0 I realized I was freaking him out so I let him go.\u00a0 My dog at this point was stand with his front paws on my bed watching knowing that something was wrong.\u00a0 He jumped up and immediately took my sons spot in my arms.\u00a0 All of this helped but the urge was still pulling me.\u00a0 I went through the normal steps of breathing and thinking about all the good things in my life, all the people that depended on me and loved me\u2026\u00a0 Even if I am often an asshole, but still the urge was pulling me and the pain was so intense I couldn\u2019t help but scream and cry.\u00a0 I know I was manifesting the pain but had no way to stop it.\u00a0 Eventually I had to get out of my house and away from the thoughts of what was waiting for me in my garage.\u00a0 As I drove, I was still floating but the pain went away.\u00a0 I was still thinking about killing myself but the physical urge was gone.\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember driving\u2026\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember turning\u2026\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember parking, but before I knew it, I was in a Walmart parking lot.\u00a0 I laid back in my seat and listened to \u201cI feel like dying\u201d by Lil Wayne 7 or 8 times.\u00a0 I had gone to Walmart for a reason but couldn\u2019t think of why so I just sat in my car and felt sorry for myself.\u00a0 Eventually I got a message on my football team\u2019s app asking about the game later today.\u00a0 I immediately remember I needed ice and Gatorade for after the game.\u00a0 As I walked through Walmart, I went out of my way to be nice and courteous to everyone who came near me\u2026\u00a0 Not trying to brag I did it for a selfish reason.\u00a0 I needed someone to be nice or kind to me.\u00a0 To my surprise, almost 100% of the people I interacted with were polite and talkative, almost like they could feel something wrong with me, or that I needed that from them.\u00a0 I eventually made it back home where I am now pouring out my feelings.\u00a0 My thoughts are clear and the urge is gone but the damage has been done.\u00a0 My wife and kids are at the mall\u2026\u00a0 My wife who is afraid to go into 7-Eleven because of COVID would rather risk the mall than be around me right now and I get it.\u00a0 I will be fine and I will do everything in my power to repair my relationship like I always do, but in the back of my mind I always wonder is this the last straw for her?\u00a0 I hope not but understand if it is.\u00a0 She knows my past and knows what I\u2019ve been through but I know she can only take so much.\u00a0 I will always love her and my kids and put them before anything else but I am scared I\u2019m pushing them away.\u00a0 I pretend like I have my mental issues in order because I take my medication daily and I go to the VA twice a year to tell them I\u2019m fine, but that is all bullshit.\u00a0 I\u2019m not fine\u2026\u00a0 I wish I were strong enough to go sit down with someone and tell them everything I saw and everything that happened to me, but the thought of it scares the living shit out of me.\u00a0 In the past 12 years I have had come to Jesus moments where I went through all the steps to set up regular counseling and each time I pussy out and don\u2019t show.\u00a0 The scary part of all of this is that the VA, knowing my issues and where my head was at, at that time, never reached out or called to see what\u2019s up.\u00a0 Each time I received a letter in the mail, weeks later, saying I missed an appointment and to \u201ccall this number to reschedule.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m not trying to put them blame on them\u2026 In the end it\u2019s my responsibility to be there but my fear is stopping me.\u00a0 I served in the military from 2002 to 2008.\u00a0 I have so many surgeries that I have lost count.\u00a0 I wake up every day in pain.\u00a0 I\u2019m lucky if it\u2019s just one of my problem areas, but I\u2019m sure that doesn\u2019t help my mental state.\u00a0 I saw some fucked up shit and some terrible things happened to me.\u00a0 As much as I push it all down and drink the thoughts away, they still creep into my dreams.\u00a0 To the point where even though the nightmares only happen every couple of months, there is a reoccurring person in my dreams, from one of my memories, that started as a night terror and now she is living and interacting in my dreams like a normal person.\u00a0 How fucked is that?\u00a0 I have pushed it down so deep that I have normalized a dead person to where she now alive and interacting with me in my dreams.\u00a0 I have never said that to anyone and reading it back makes me realize how crazy I might be lol.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf this gets out and you took the time to read it, I\u2019m sorry for the rambling and the poor me shit\u2026\u00a0 I honestly have an amazing life that my wife and I have built.\u00a0 We have three beautiful kids and three awesome dogs.\u00a0 We live in a big house, in a quite suburb, and have everything we want or need.\u00a0 All of that makes it that much harder for me to wrap my head around morning like today.\u00a0 I say that I could never do anything like that to my wife and kids, but honestly how much more damage am I doing with constantly being an asshole to them.\u00a0 Would they be better off with out me?\u00a0 Not necessarily dead, but out of the picture.\u00a0 Do I do more good than harm?\u00a0 These are question I need to figure out for myself and take the appropriate actions to fix them.\u00a0 Here come the cringy ending\u2026\u00a0 I am NOT OK and that is OK.\u00a0 I need to start taking responsibility for my own mental health.\u00a0 I\u2019m tired of walking around and acting like I have my shit together and making everyone think I have the perfect life.\u00a0 I doubt they think that but you understand what I\u2019m saying.\u00a0\u00a0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/iiw7v5/i_broke/", "title": "I Broke", "social_network": "reddit", "user":
