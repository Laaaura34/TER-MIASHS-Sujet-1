I'm on tablets, I'm getting counselling (for what it's worth) but I just want it to end. I'm 32 and have felt like this since I was 14. I have suicidal thoughts every day, nothing makes it go away, I can't cry I also feel incredibly guilty I don't even know why! I feel that getting some in hospital treatment would help me but I also feel like I'd be wasting the Drs time or I would simply be ignored.
