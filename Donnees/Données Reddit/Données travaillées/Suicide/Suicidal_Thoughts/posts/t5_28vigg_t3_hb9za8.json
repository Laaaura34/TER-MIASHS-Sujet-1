He has problems and he knows it, he isn't the smartest and he has issues. But if I do this to him, he's going to go into a psychotic break. He's going to be destroyed when he finds out I died. That I couldn't handle it anymore. He's going to be ruined and it's all my fault. I don't want to hurt him I never have hurt him before. But I cant handle this anymore. I just hope when I do he'll be okay. I hope in the end he'll be happy. That's all I've ever wanted for him was happiness.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hb9za8/if_i_end_up_committing_suicide_the_person_who/", "title": "If I end up committing suicide, the person who will be the most hurt is my best friend of 12/13 years.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TexasSpidey", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1592465114, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hb9za8/if_i_end_up_committing_suicide_the_person_who/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429568.4333344, "replies_charged": false}
